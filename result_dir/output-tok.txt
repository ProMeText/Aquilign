Chapter I The word and speche in euerich thyng mote be as large as þat þyng axeþ 
and noþer more nother lasse, 
as þe philosofer wol, 
seuenþe Methaphisice. 
Þanne Ʒif it is Ʒoure entent to Ʒeue art 
and knowlech of gouernans of prynces oþer of kynges, 
þat þer be noƷt more large 
nother more sotyl speche 
þan þis work axeþ, 
first it is to wetyng what is þe maner of processe 
in this arte. 
Þanne it is to wetyng 
þat in al moral mater, 
þat is to saye mater touchyng mannys maner, 
the maner of processe, 
as þe philosofer seith, is figural, 
þat is to say by liknes, 
mde and boystous. 
For in suche | mater it nedeþ to passe by fygures and liknes. 
For moral dede fa[l]leþ nouƷt complet, 
þat is to saye fullich, 
vnder tales. 
And we may honty by þre weyes 
þat þe maner of processe 
in þis sciens 
mote be figural, 
by liknesse, 
and boistouse. 
Þe firste wey is itake by þe mater 
þat is itreted in suche art; 
þe seconde by þe ende 
þat ‡is entent, 
þat is for to say imened or purposed and desired, 
in þis art; 
þe þre by þe scoler þat is itauƷt by þis art. 
Þe first wey is ischewede in þis wise. 
For þe lore and techyng of gouernans of princes [is] of doyng and dedes of mankynde 
and is conteyned 
vnder moral mater 
(þat is to say vnder hiƷ and derk materes), 
and it is iseid moral mater 
(þat is to saye þis derke mater) 
suffreth nouƷt sotil serchyng, 
but it is [of] syngulers doyngs 
þat ben ful vncerteyne, 
for þei ben ful changeable and varyant, 
a[s] it is declared, 
secundo Ethicorum: 
þanne for as soche dedes ben synguler, 
so a techeth þat in þis work the intencioun 
(that is ‡ to say þe inward menynge) 
schal be take syngulerliche 
and by fygures and liknes. 
It semeþ that the philosofer toucheþ þis resoun, 
primo Ethicorum, 
for a semeþ 
that it is inow iseide of moral mater, 
that is for to saye of hyghe mater and derke, 
[i]f þe euydences 
is imade as þe mater axeth. 
And seith therto it longeth 
to a wyse man 
to inquyre certenyte, 
þat is þe sikernesse, 
after eueriche gendre 
that is in þe kynde of þe þyng. 
And it semeth 
that þe kynde of moral mater, 
þat is to say this hyghe derk mater, 
is contrarye to mathematik matir; 
for in mathematik mater, demonstracions, 
þat is schewyng mater, 
ben certeyn in þe firste gre of certeynete, 
| as the comentour seith, 
ii [Methaphis]icorum. 
Bote moral resons beth semyng outward and boistous. 
Þanne the gemeter shal not make persuasions, 
that is to say voydyng, 
bot demonstracions, 
þat is shewyng, 
bot rethorik and þe politik schal noƷt make demonstracions 
bote persuacyons. 
Þerfore, i Ethicorum, 
it is wrete þat [it] is next 
as gret syn to þe mathematik 
to allowe hym þat makeþ persuasions, 
that is to say the folwynges, 
as it is to the rethorik 
to axe demonstracions, 
that is to say the schewynges. 
The secunde wey is itake 
by the ende 
that is entent, 
iment and desired in þis art. 
For it is iwrete, 
ii Ethicorum, 
we taketh moral work, 
that is to say highe and derke work, 
nouƷt by cause of contemplacioun 
nother for to be konnyng, 
bote for to be good. 
Þanne the ende 
and the entent 
in this sciens 
is nouƷt knowleche‡ 
bote work and doyng; 
nother sothnes, 
but profit of godenesse. 
Þanne sotil resons 
byschineth the witte, 
bot resouns that beth boistous 
and semyng outward meueth and brenneth the affeccioun. 
In speculatif sciens istudied in book 
in the whiche schinyng of the inwit is isouƷt, 
the processe schal be subtil by demonstracions; 
bote in moral matir we secheth rightfulnes 
of wil 
that we may be good. 
Therfore in moral matir the processe mote be 
by euydens and figures and liknes. 
And so it is iwrite, 
primo Ethicorum, 
that moral matier 
is to louyng of the sothe, 
is ischewed boystousliche, 
and by liknes, 
by soche preues and of dedes 
that falleth ofte tyme. 
Þe þridde wey is itake by the lurner 
þat schal be itauƷt in this art. 
For theigh this book 
be itytled of the lore of princes, 
Ʒut al the puple schal be itauƷt þerby; 
and theigh nouƷt eueriche man 
may be kyng oþer prince, 
Ʒit eueriche man schulde desire besiliche to make | himself worthi to be a kyng oþer a prince. 
And that may not be bote thinges 
that beþ yseyd ben iknowe and ikept. 
Þan al þe peple is 
in som wise lurner and scoler of þis art, 
bot fewe ben scharp of wit; 
þerfore it is iseid, 
[iii] Rethoricorum, 
þat þe more peple is, 
þe lasse and þe forþer is þe wit. 
Þan þe scoler of moral mater, 
that is to saye of high and derke matere, 
it is symple and boystous, 
as it is ischewed, 
primo Rethoricorum. 
Þanne for nouƷt 
al the poeple may comprehende sotil thinges, 
the processe in moral mater 
mote be boistous 
and by liknes of figuris. 
As þe philosofer seith [in] Poletic[is], 
in thinges þat þe lord mot konne commande þes sogettes 
mot be obedient and do 
as he is ihote. 
On this booke princes beth informed how a schal haue hamself, 
and how a schal hote 
and commande here sogettes. 
And in this teching and lore mote strechche to the poeple 
that a knowe 
how a schal be obedient to here princes. 
And that may not be, 
as it is iseid, 
bote by superficial resons, 
that is to sey resons goyng aboute and sencible, 
that is felyng resons. 
Tharfore the maner processe 
in this work 
mote be gret and figural. Chapter II 
For al lore and al discipline cometh of forknoweleche, 
as it is iseide, primo Posteriorum, 
hit is wel fittyng 
to telle the order of thinges 
that schal be iseide, 
to haue som forknowlech tharof. By forknoweleche the thinges 
that schal be iseid schal be the souner vnderstonde. 
Thanne it is to wetyng 
that it is oure entent 
to devyde this hole booke 
in þre parcial bookes. 
In þe furste boke tharof it schal be schowed 
how the kynges maieste, 
and so how eueriche man, 
schal rule hymself. 
In the secounde 
how a schal rewle his meyne. 
In the thridde how a schal rule a cite and a regne. 
Þan ethica and monastica, 
the sciens of maners 
o[r] thewes, 
serueth to þe firste | boke. Iconomyk, 
a sciens of housbondrie, 
serueth to the secounde boke. 
And politica, 
that ruleth citees and regnes, 
serueth to the thridde booke. 
And þis ordre is resonable and kynde. 
For what longeth to other cometh of thinges 
that longeth to vsself. 
Tharfor, ix Ethicorum, 
it is iseid 
that it semeth that frendschep 
that is do to frendes comeþ of thinges 
that longeth to the selue frende. 
For he semeþ a frende 
þat lo[u]eth his frend as hemself. 
Þanne what is iseide of frendschipe 
hath soþe‡ [in] his inwit and konnyng of regnyng. 
For he that wol be wise and kunnynge to gouerne and rule 
oþer schal be wise and konnynge to gouerne 
and to rule hymself. 
Therfore it is resonable to declare and determine raþer of his owne gouernans þan of gouernans of meyne oþer of regnes. 
Also this ordre is nouƷt onliche resonable bote kyndeliche also, 
for alwey kynde passeth 
from vnparfite to parfite, 
as man is rather vnparfite and child 
þan parfite and man. 
In speculatif (istude mater by boke) mater alwey we passeth forth 
from vnparfite to parfite, 
as man hath rather vnparfite sciens and konnyng, 
and afterward parfite; 
and so he þat Ʒeueth hym to speculacioun (studie in book) 
is continualliche more parfite and mor for to haue parfite connyng in a manere 
þat is possible to hym. 
Þan what is iseide 
by kynde ordre in speculatif mater 
haþ soþnesse in mater of werkes and of dedis; 
for as in speculatif, 
þat is book mater, 
vnparfite kunnynge goth tofore, 
so in actif mater ido in dede, 
kyndelich vnparfite konnyng cometh tofore parfite wisdom. 
For nouƷt so grete wisdom 
nedeth to rule hymself 
as nedeth to reule meynee: 
nother so grete to rule meynee, 
| as nedeth to rule citees and regnes. 
Þanne in kynde 
ord[r]e it semeth the kynges maieste 
is to kunne ferste rule hymself, 
and þanne to kunne rule his meyne, 
and þe þridde to konne rule regnes and cites. 
In the first in the whoche 
is itreted 
of his owne 
rewlyng foure poyntes schal be declared. First, 
it schal be ishawed 
whare in þe kyng his maieste schal sette his ende 
and his felicite, 
otturmyste or fynal lykyng. 
The seconde, 
what vertues he schal haue. 
The þridde, 
what p[a]‡ssiouns a schal folwe. 
The ferde, 
what maners a schal vse. 
For a man may nouƷt leue wel 
and rule wel hymself, 
bote a Ʒeue hymself 
to goode workes and dedes, 
ireuled by ordre of resoun. 
Who that wol trete of his owne gouernaunce schal trete of al diuerce workes and dedes. 
Therfore, ii Ethicorum, the philosofer wol þat it is profit 
in moral matiere of mannys manere 
to trete of thinges 
that longeth to workes and dedes, 
and in what maner 
is the doyng of workes and dedes. 
As it longeth to this purpos it semeth that oure workes and dedes cometh of foure, 
and beth of diuers þerby, 
and cometh of endes, 
of passiouns, 
of habites and of maneres. 
For þe ende is begynnyng of oure dedes, 
as a man worcheþ for diuerse endys, 
he worcheþ and doþ diuerse dedis. 
Þanne to wete 
what we schal do and worche, 
it semeth most profit to wete 
for what ende we desireth, 
and for it is iseide, 
ii Ethicorum, 
that likynge is synne 
and tokene of habite igendred, 
as in dedes we haueth diuers habites, 
and haueth likyng in diuers dedes. 
In the thridde wise, 
dedes ben diuers, 
nouƷ[t] onliche 
by endes and habites, 
bote also by passiouns, 
for men of diuers passiouns 
worcheth diuersliche. 
For we | seeth 
that drede and wanhope 
ben oþer passiouns ‡ þan is hope. For thay that ben in drede 
and in wanhope of the victory 
doth shameliche 
and forsaketh the scheltrum, 
and fleth out of the bataile; 
and thay that beth in hope 
of the victorie reseth 
and auentureth on here enemyes. 
What is iseide of hope 
and of drede 
ys vnderstonde of oþer passiouns. 
Al affecciouns and passiouns 
worchen in vs som inclinacioun 
to do diuers dedes. 
The furthe wise, 
it semeth that maners maketh workes diuers; 
for they that hauen olde men maners 
worcheth and doth oþer wise 
þan thay that haueth Ʒonge men maners. 
For as it schal be iseide in his place, 
olde men ben kyndelich ouertrowyng an[d] coueitous, 
and Ʒonge men kyndelich trowen sone 
and ben liberal and fre of hert. 
And it semeth þese foure hauen a maner proporcioun togedres, 
for of diuers maners cometh diuers passiouns; 
and of diuers passions 
cometh diuers habites; 
and of diuers abites comeþ ordinauns 
and of diuerse of desire endes. 
For as olde men maneres 
and Ʒonge men maneres ben diuers, 
so theire affecciouns and passiouns ben diuers. 
And as gode men and euel men haueþ diuers maneres 
so thaire habites ben diuers. 
Also by diuers habites, 
we ordeineth to vs diuers endes. 
For as it is iseide, 
iii Ethicorum, 
þat suche as eueriche man is, 
soche an ende pleseth hym. 
As to the intemperate, 
that is he 
that folweth þe lustus of flesch, 
that is an intemporate man, 
it semeth that al the ende and gret felicite 
is in seruice of Venus. 
And also þey þat haue oþer habites 
ben inclined and desirede endes, 
accordyng to thaire habites. 
Þanne in the furste book 
we schullen trete 
of al these foure: 
and first of the ende and felicite of princes, 
and of thaire vertues, passiouns, and maners. 
Bote firste, we schal speke of the ende oþer of felicite 
for in doyng 
and in actyue mater 
the ende is | more chief principal 
þan eny of the other. Chapter III 
For as it is iseid 
we taketh this work 
by cause of lore, 
and no man lerneth atte wille, 
but he be wel willed, 
abel to leme, 
and takyng gode hede. 
After that in the firste chapitre 
we made þe kynges 
maiestee wel willed, 
schewyng þat we schollen esylich trete þynges þat schollen be isayd; 
and in þe seconde chapitre we made þe kynges maieste able to lerne, 
tellyng the ordre of þynges 
þat schal be iseide; 
it is to doynge in this þridde chapitre 
that we make to take hede and goode entent, 
declaryng how grete profite is 
in thinges 
that schal be isaide. 
For comonliche men hateþ harde speche and strange, 
as meny scolers 
bien wel iwelled to ham 
þat speketh esy speche and pleyn. 
And theyƷ that bien corrumpt appetite, 
des[i]re, 
in other sciens, 
Ʒut in moral matier of the whoche the maner of the mater axeth boistous tretyng and figural, 
it is nouƷt corrumpt appetite, 
bote more right ordre and due. 
Þanne in suche art the scoler is made wel willed by light 
and esi maner spekyng, 
and is imade abel to leme 
by the order of thinges 
that schal be iseid. 
For nameliche a scoler is imade abel to lerne 
if the thinges 
that schal be iseide 
ben itolde 
and irekened to hym arewe. 
By profite of thinges 
þat schal be iseide 
þe scoler is imade take hede, 
if he hopeth to hire thing 
that is good and profitable. 
By the thinges that schal be iseid, 
if þey ben wel iknowen and dueliche ikept and holde, the kyng schal haue foure, 
as it longeth to this worke, 
þe whoche foure eueriche man 
schal most loue and desire. First, 
a schal wynne the beste goodes; 
þe secunde, 
schal wynne hymself; 
þe þridde, 
a schal wynne other men; 
þe | four‡the, 
he schal wynne and haue Goode hymself 
and felicite withoute ende. 
And goodes destingueth in on wise, 
for ‡ som is good, 
and som is better, 
and som is best. 
Otter good is good, 
and inward good is better, 
and may be comyn to goode men and euel; 
as wisdome, konnyng, 
and kynde wit, 
and vertues of the saule. 
In this goode men and euel beth parteners. 
Þe best gode is inward gode, 
and euel men beƷt nouƷt partiners therof; 
and gode vertues beth soche gode. 
For as holy seyntes and philosofres meneth no man mesvseth vertues, 
þerfore primo Rethoricorum, 
it is iseid 
that onlich vertues ben nouƷt mysvsed. 
And other wise gode is destyngued 
as þe philosofer meneth 
tam in Magnis Moralibus quam in Ethicis, 
for som good is likyng 
and som is profitable 
and som is honest. 
Honest good is excellent gode, 
for as he seith, 
in honest gode is closed likyng and profite; 
for Ʒif þe gode is honest, 
he conteyneth grete likyng and profite. 
Thanne for in this book 
in what maner þe kynge 
may be imade honest and vertuous 
and how a shal brynge his sugettes 
to honeste and to vertues, 
þanne in thinges 
[that shal be iseide] 
is most profit, 
for therby, 
yf they ben ykept, 
is igete chef gode and honeste. 
Þe seconde, 
in thinges that shal be iseide is most profit, 
for therby man wynneth nouƷt [onliche] the cheef gode, 
bote also a wynneth hymself. 
[It] is ofte iseid moral matier is ivsed 
for we sholde be gode. 
A good man hath hymself 
and an euel man hath nouƷt hymself. 
We schal ‡ imagine in þis wise: 
as in regne and a citee meny beþ iordeyned vnder on duc and vnder kyng, 
so in one and in the same man‡ vertues 
þat bien partiners of resoun | 
ben iordeined 
vnder the inwit 
þat is resonable of itself. 
Þanne as it is nouƷt iseide 
þat a kyng haþ the regne, 
nother a duc hath the cite, 
Ʒif ther is strif and descencioun in the regne 
oþer in the cite, 
oþer Ʒif the men of the regne and of the citee ben nouƷt obedient to the kyng nother to þe duke; 
so it is singulerliche iseide, 
that som man hath nouƷt hymself 
Ʒif his appetite, desire, 
is contrary to resoun, 
and the partiners of resoun 
ben nouƷt obedient to the chief vertu of resoun. 
By þe philosofer, 
ix Ethicorum, 
man is most vnderstondyng and resoun. 
Þan yf resoun 
is nouƷt maister of thinges 
þat ben in man, 
man is nouƷt lord of hymself, 
nother ruleth, 
nother hath hymself properliche for to speke, 
bote he wol on bi resoun 
and the contrari 
by passione idrawe 
and inclined in that wyse. 
Þan Ʒif an Ʒeuel man hath nouƷt hymself, 
and þe gode man hath hymself, 
by þe sciens 
þat makeþ vs gode, 
a man wenneth hymself. 
Þe þridde, 
a wynneth other men. 
For Ʒif a rector, gouemour, ruleth hymself, 
a‡ is worthi 
to be made rector, gouernour, 
and lord of other men. 
For he that hath wisdom and redynes 
and other moral vertues, 
of the whoche it is itreted 
in this boke, 
is worthi to be a prince. 
And Ʒif hym lakketh this redines, 
þeyƷ he be a prince 
by ciuyle, temporel, myƷte and strengþe, 
Ʒut a Ʒis more worthi to be a sogette 
þan a prince oþer a lord, 
and he is more kyndeliche seruant þan a lord. 
Þe furthe, 
Ʒif we holdeth and kepeth þe lore 
that is itauƷt in this boke, 
we shal gete and haue God 
hymself and felicite, 
blis withoute ende. 
For God is essencia, 
beyng in vnite or onhede; 
for he is most on and gode. 
And the more a man neigheth to vnite and to godenes, 
the more a is accordyng 
to þe first principium, 
bygynnyng, 
that is God, 
| and a parfite man hath Gode. 
And euel men beþ nouƷt ioned with God, 
for al here kyngdom is departed and toschatered. 
For eueriche mannis regne stondeth in þat 
that the myghtes and vertues of the soule 
beth iruled by wit and resoun. 
Þanne Ʒif resoun techeth on and þe appe[t]ite an nother, 
and doþ the contrary and aƷens resoun, 
as it fareth in men with euel soules, 
þanne þe man is nouƷt ioned, 
bote hath descencioun, 
strif withinne hymself, 
and is vnlich to God. 
Bote hy that bien excellent in vertues and habundant, 
that is plentyuouse, 
in honeste gode, 
for a folweth þe rule of resoun and gode þat is verrey good, 
an[d] haueth sencible good in hamself, 
and vnite and goodnes 
and beth therefoure accordyng to God, 
and it is acounted 
that thei hauen Good within hamself, 
þanne in the matir 
þat schal be saide 
is so gret profite, 
þat Ʒif we do þerby, 
we schal wynne moche goode and chief goode, 
vsself and other, 
and we schal haue God 
hymself and felicite withoute ende. 
Bote for the thinges 
that we schal teche 
may nouƷt be ikept 
and iholde withoute grace of God, 
it is semelich þat eueriche man, 
and namelich þe kyng, 
praye and byseche þe grace of God. 
For the more highe the kyng 
is aboue oþer men 
þe more nede 
he hath to praye grace of God, 
that a may vse dedes of vertues, 
and brynge his sogettes to vertues. Chapter IV 
After certeyn preambule forseid thinges 
that beth nedeful to this purpos, 
how by liƷt esy maner tretyng 
of this worke 
we maketh the kyng wel willed, 
and by ordre of thinges 
that schal be iseid 
we maketh hym abel, 
and by profite 
that is ifounde þerinne we | maketh hym take intent 
and good hede þerto, now it is to telle al arewe þynges þat ‡ schal be iseid in this worke. 
And fore the ende is most principal cause of dedes, 
as it is iseid tofore honde, 
þanne †the resoun † schal bygynne tretyng of the ende and of felicite. 
And for þer bien diuers maneres of leuyng, 
dyuers men ordeyneth 
to hamsilf 
dyuersliche diuers endes, 
þe maners of leuyng schal be irekened, 
and it schal be ischowed 
how felicite schal be iset þerinne. 
As the philosofre seith, primo Ethicorum, 
philosofres distingueth 
thre maner of leuyng: voluptuose, politik, and contemplatiue. 
For he seith þat man is mene bytwene the ouer thyng and þe nether, 
for man is kyndelich mene bytwene 
oþer bestes and angels 
and is bynethe angels 
and aboue other bestes. 
Þanne we may take hede of man in thre wise: furst, 
as a comuneth with other bestes; 
þe secunde, 
as man is som what in hymself; 
þe þridde, 
as man comuneth 
and is partyner with angels. 
By these þre consideraciouns philosofres taketh 
þe forsaide þre maner of leuyng and meneth 
that mannes leuyng 
þat leueth 
as an other best is voluptuouse, 
and hys lyf that leueth 
as he is som what in hymself is pollitic lif, 
and his lif that leueth 
as comunyng with angels 
is lyf contemplatif. 
Þanne eueriche man 
leueth as anoþer beste, 
oþer as a man, 
oþer as ang[e]ls. 
For he that leueth by voluptuose lyf, 
a lyueth as other bestes; 
and by cyuyl lyf, 
[a lyueth as a man; 
and by] contemplatife, 
as an angel. 
Philosofres distyngueth these þre maners of leuyng 
and setteth bote twey maner of felicite. 
For a denyeth that felicite 
is in voluptuose lyf, 
and so doth dyuynes also, 
and setteth double felicite, politik and contemplatif. 
And so he is icleped felix þat hath felicite 
(þat is to say blessednesse) as a man, 
[and hath] in hymself redines and 
right|ful reson of doyng and of dedes. 
And he is felix contemplatif that hath felicite aboue mankynde, 
and hath felicitee nouƷt onlych as man 
bote hath som what that longeth to God, 
and is beter þan man. 
Þanne philosophres clepeth hym 
þat is parfite 
in doyng and dedes felix, 
and hym that hath felicite contemplatif a clepeth nouƷt man 
bote beter þan man. 
For doyng and comunyng in dedes [with] other is in man, 
in þat a is a man; 
bote speculacioun and knowlich of sothenes ys in a man 
in that a hath speculatif wit, 
that is som dele godlich, 
and comuneth tharby wyth God 
and with angelis. 
And so, primo Poleticorum, 
it is iseide 
that eueriche man 
is ‡ oþur ━wors┐ ━than┐ man 
and is þan a beste, 
other a is better þan man 
and is som what goodeliche 
and an half goode. 
And Ʒif a is man, 
what is man? 
And it is ipreued man 
is a compaynable beste, 
and ciuile and politike, 
and lyueth þan politik lif, 
þat is to say, 
a wise lif 
and iruled by redines and by resoun. 
Bote Ʒif a es a beste and wors þan man, 
þan a is nouƷt ireuled by redynes 
and by resoun 
bote by passyoun, 
and leueth voluptuose lif, 
that is a wilful lyf. 
Bote Ʒif a ys godeliche and better þan man, 
þanne a hath contemplacioun 
by wit and wisdom 
and lyueth contemplatiue lif. 
Þanne bytwene hym 
that is wis and redy in actiue doynges and dedes and hym 
that is parfite in speculacion, 
þat is in sight, 
is as gret differens 
as is betwene politik [lif of man] 
and contemplatif lif of angels. 
Þey that bien iƷeue to worlych dedes 
bien ofte destourbed in many thinges, 
for diuers doynges þat fallen, 
and feleth of passions of the flesche 
as for the more parte. 
Bote thei that bien iƷeue to speculacioun, 
that is to say schowyng maters, 
bien som del withdrawe 
fro suche passy|ons. 
And for lyue in flesch 
and nouƷt by the flesch 
is more angels doyng 
þan manys doyng, 
and philosofres clepeth hym felix 
that leueth in contemplacioun, 
and nouƷt in polletic felicite 
and as a man, 
bote that a comuneth with holy angels. 
Þanne wise men and speculatif schal be iworschepped, 
for they ben isette aboue a man. 
Þanne so of maneres of leuyng 
and of felicite 
þat is ifounde tharinne, 
philosofres distyngueth. 
Bote þei myƷt nouƷt come to þe sothe atte folle, 
and in al maner wise. 
For þeiƷ thei seide sothlich 
that felicite schal nouƷt be isouƷt 
in voluptees lyf, 
þat is a wilful lyf, 
as it shal be iseide more clerelich withinne, 
bote of politik lyf, 
that dyuynes clepeth actyue lyf, 
and of contemplatif lif, 
soche philosofertes] mened nouƷt al sothe and trouthe atte folle. 
For thei trowed that man myƷt voide alle synnes 
by pure kynde doyng, 
with[oute] other helpe of grace, 
and lyue parfiteliche 
in actif lyf other contemplatif lyue. 
Bote that is fals, 
as it is iseid tofore hond, 
al þat wol [ly]ue riƷtfullich nedeth Goddes grace, 
and namelich kynges and rulers of other men. 
Also thei sette contemplatif lyue in pure speculacioun, 
and that is fals; 
for neuer man is parfite, 
by suche a lyf, 
bote he haue in hym loue in God and charite. 
In this thei mened nouƷt ariƷt; 
bote in that thei seide 
that contemplatif lif 
is better than politik lif other actif, 
thei accordeth with diuynes 
and with riƷt fey of Holy Cherche. Now this is ido, say we, 
that it semeth a kyng 
to knowe these maneres of leuyng, 
and to fle voluptuos lif, 
that he be nouƷt wors þan man, 
for as it is iseide, 
primo Ethicorum, 
soche cheseth lyf of bestes. 
Bote a kyng schal haue 
in hymself 
bothe actif lyf and contemplatif, 
þat a may rule his sugettes 
by actif lyf, 
and profite to hymself 
by contemplatif lif 
and inward deuocioun and loue of God. 
| Þis inward deuocioun 
is the more nedeful to kynges and princes, 
for he shal Ʒeue rekenyng of meny doyng 
dedes tofore the heighest iuge. Chapter V 
It is ful besylich to wetyng 
that as by thew transmutacions and chaungynges mater cometh to perfeccioun and forme, 
so by riƷtful and [th]ewe workes 
and dedes man cometh 
to his perfeccioun and felicite. 
Þanne for man worcheth neuer ariƷt 
as it nedeth for to come 
to þe ende 
bote a knowe the ende, 
[and] wol come to his ende 
and to his felicite, 
it is spedful 
to knowe his ende 
and his felicite. 
As it longeþ to þis work, 
we may bi twey weyes declar[e] 
þat it is spedful to a kyng to knowe his ende. 
Þe furste is for by his workes 
and dedes he cometh to his ende. 
Þe seconde wey, 
for the kyng schal reule oþer men. 
Þe furste wey is declared in this wise. 
For to come to gode ende 
by workes and dedes 
þre thinges ben nedeful: 
þe firste is to do wel, 
þe secounde to do by eleccioun 
an[d] freliche, 
the þridde to do with likyng. 
For Ʒif man doth euel 
and nouƷt wel a cometh 
nouƷt to gode ende bote to þe contrary of the ende. 
For as it is iseide, ii Phisicorum, 
the ende is nouƷt 
onlich the laste bote 
also som what þat is beste. 
Þerfore, ii Methaphisicorum, 
þe philosofer meneth the ende 
and gode is al one, 
and who þat bynemeth ende 
bynemeth al gode and profite. 
And so Ʒif thei 
that don euel ben worthi 
to haue euel and harme, 
for euel is contrary to good, 
and so to the ende, 
euel doers, 
in þat þat ben suche, 
ben nouƷt worthi to haue goode ende 
bote the contrary of gode ende. 
And also nouƷt onlich euel doers failleþ of the ende, 
but also þei that may do wel; bote a do wel he schal nouƷt haue þe corone noþer 
þe ende of felicite, 
þat is to say blessednesse. 
And so, primo Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer seith in Olympiadibus, 
that is to menyng in þe strong bataille, 
þat [h]o hatte þe strengeste men | 
bien nouƷt [corouned] 
bote thei 
that fighten and don dedes of maystry, 
and Ʒif þei fiƷten nouƷt in dede 
thei schul nouƷt haue þe coroune; 
þan it nedeth to worche in dede, 
þat we may by [ou]re workes be worthi 
to haue the ende an[d] felicite, 
þat is blessednes. 
Þe secunde, 
it nedeth that thei worche by eleccioun and freliche; 
for who þat doþ wel by hap 
is nouƷt ipreysed 
for his dedes 
nother wynneth þerby þe ende nother felicite. 
For dedes þat cometh nouƷt of fre eleccioun bien nouƷt wilful. 
And, 
as the philosofer seith, iii Ethicorum, 
for vnwilful dedes 
we ben nouƷt ipreysed nother iblamed, 
and so þer it is iseid 
that no man is holy bote willyng. 
Bot what we doun nouƷt by eleccioun, 
we doun nouƷt willing. 
Proprelich to speke of soche dedes, 
in that þei bien soche, 
þerby we cometh nouƷt to felicite. 
A vertue is an habite of choys and is in the myddel, 
as it is iseide, 
ii Ethicorum; 
þe dedes by the whoch we comen to þe ende mote corae of eleccioun. 
Þe þridde, 
that [m]e mote worche 
with his likyng, 
for the more likyng a man hath in a dede, 
the more wilfulliche a doth 
þat dede 
and with habite of vertue. 
And so, ii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer meneth 
þat it is nouƷt 
ynouwe to do gode, 
bote wel; 
nothere it suffiseth nouƷt 
to do riƷtful dedes, 
bote it nedeth to do riƷthfulliche. 
Fore it happeth 
that schrewes doun gode 
dedes 
bote for thei doun ham nouƷt wel and with likyng, 
it nedeth nouƷt that thei come tharby 
to þe ende 
and to felicite, 
þat is blessednes. 
Þanne whanne these thre cometh ifere, 
that we doþ gode 
and by eleccioun and with likyng, 
namelich in that wise we cometh to ende, 
and these falleth moste Ʒif 
it is iknowe. 
Thanne to come to þe ende, 
it is spedful to knowe the ende. 
And we shal ymagine in þis wise 
that in causes that worcheth, 
þe secunde worcher worcheth 
by vertue of þe furste worcher, 
so þe secondari endes meueth 
by vertue of þe last ende; 
þarfore as Ʒif þer were no worcher | furste, 
þanne no worcher scholde worche so Ʒif þer were no laste ende 
and Ʒif we hadde nouƷt in þought 
as laste gode 
and final to meve the wille. 
[And noon oþer to gode may meve þe wille.] 
For al þat þe wil [wol], 
he wol it is in order 
to som what that a wol 
for laste and fynal ende. 
Þanne Ʒif nouƷt is in thought desired as fynal ende, 
þanne a worcheth noƷt wel nother doþ wel; 
for Ʒif it were so, 
þanne scholde cesse al dedes of mankynde. 
Þanne to worche, 
we moste ordeyne for what ende; 
bote for to worche and do wel, 
we moste worche and do for a gode ende, 
for the ende makeþ oure dedes gode oþer euel, 
for no dede may be gode 
Ʒif it is iordeyned for an euel ende. 
Þanne for to do wel it 
nedeth to knowe þe ende. 
Þe seconde, 
suche knowleche nedeth 
þat we may worche by eleccioun. 
For as archers 
þat seeth noƷt the mark, 
þeigh he hitte þe marke, 
þat is bote his happe. 
So thei that knoweth nouƷt the ende, 
theiƷ a do wel and come to þe ende, 
þat is nouƷt by aleccioun, 
bote by hap. 
Þerfore þe philosofer wol mene þat al knowleche of the ende is nedeful, 
for knowleche of þe ende 
is a gret helpe to oure lyf 
for to come to þe ende, 
as an archers knowyng a mark cometh 
þe rather to what hem nedeth. 
Þe þridde, 
knowlich of þe ende makeþ vs nouƷt onlich do wel [and by eleccioun] 
bote also likyngliche; 
for eny workes and dedes beth imade likyng and swete by consideracioun of welþe and felicite 
þat cometh þerof. 
Thanne to worche and do wel and by eleccioun 
and with likyng, 
it is spedful to eueriche man 
to knowe his felicite 
and is nameliche spedefol 
to a kyng 
þat schal 
in his dedes take hede 
to þe comyn profite 
that is better and | more goodelich 
þan eny 
that is a singuler profite. 
And so it is most semeliche 
þat a kyng knowe his felicite, 
that a may vse wel 
and with likyng 
and by eleccioun þe comyn dedes 
þat beth as it were 
som dele Goddes dedes. 
Þe secunde, 
þe same, 
for þe kyng schal rule oþer. 
Theigh the arwe se nouƷt þe mark, 
[nathales þe arwe hitteþ þe 
mark,] for the archere scheteth and ruleth 
þe schot to the mark. 
Þanne as it is more spedefol 
that the archere se the mark 
þan the arwe se the mark, 
for he ruleth þe schot 
and the arwe to þe mark, 
so it is more spidefol 
þat a kyng knowe þe ende and felicite 
þan it is 
þat þe poeple knowe it, 
for þe kyng ruleth þe poeple. Chapter VI 
Comunliche þe comyn puple perseiueth nouƷt bote sencible delectacions, 
þat is felyng delectacioun and likyngs, and þerfore it is þat comynliche delectacions and likyngs 
þat beþ most sencible 
we clepeth delectacions and voluptuositees, 
as delectacions and likyng of touche and of taste, 
þeiƷ likyng of inwit and spirituale be better 
and more excellent withoute comparisoun, 
properliche for to speke, 
[þan sencible voluptuositees]. 
Þanne felicite schal nouƷt be isette 
in suche sencible dileccions 
and likyng of flesche, 
we may declare by þre weyes. 
As it longeth to þis work felicite meneth þre: 
parfite good and suffisaunt by hitself; 
for þan man is felix 
whanne he hath þat thing 
in þewhoche is hisparfite gode; 
and so þe philosofer, [i] Ethicorum, 
descryueth felicite and seith that felicite 
is ende of workes and dedes, 
parfite gode and suffisaunt by hitself. 
And of this furste folweth þe secounde, 
þat felicite is som what after resoun 
and as resoun demeth. 
And for gode þat is after resoun 
in þe whiche is parfyte and verrey gode, 
and sencible gode is gode 
for som what and for a tyme, 
þanne Ʒif felicite is parfite gode, 
a mot be intellectu|ale gode and resounhabel, 
oþer is the same, 
and mote be soche gode 
as riƷt resoun demeth for to haue. 
And here of folweth þe þridde, 
þat felicite is gode of þe soule 
and nouƷt of þe body. 
And for the body is ordeyned to þe saule 
as mater to þe fourme 
and vnparfite þyng 
to his perfeccioun, 
bote goode of the body is vnparfite 
in comparisoun to gode of þe soule, 
þerfore resoun demeth nouƷt 
to gete suche goode 
in that wise as gode of þe saule. 
Þanne for ‡ felicite ys parfite good, 
it is ━good┐ of the saule and of resoun. 
For parfite gode of man stondeth 
in worching of the saule by resoun, 
as it is declared, 
primo Ethicorum. 
Þanne for voluptuose likyng 
and sencible delectacioun 
is nought parfite gode 
nother goode of the saule and of resoun, 
þanne it is openliche iknowe 
that felicite schold nouƷt be iset 
in soche delectaciouns and likyng. 
Þat soche voluptuosite, 
þat is wil and delectacions, 
is nouƷt parfite gode and suffisaunt hit 
may be sone iknowe, 
for soche gode fulfilleth the appetite, 
and soche voluptuose delectacions, 
þat is delit, 
may nouƷt fulfille þe appetite 
as eueriche man 
may fele in hymself. 
And so, iii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer speketh of soche delectacions, 
and seith þat þe delicate appetite 
may nouƷt [be] fulfilled. Þe secounde, 
felicite schal nouƷt be isette 
in soche delectaciouns, 
and seith for thei ben nouƷt gode by resoun 
bote thei bene more sencible gode 
and gode of resoun, 
the more þey bien, 
þe more fre þe[y] maken þe resoun 
to be isped. 
For by resoun, 
what letteth resoun is inconuenient; 
bote soche sencible delectaciouns, 
Ʒif þei bien strong, 
a blendeth resoun 
as it is iseide, 
iii Ethicorum, 
in this wise, 
Ʒif suche dlecciouns bien grete and strong and smiteth resoun. 
Þe þridde, felicitee | schal nouƷt be iset 
in sencible delectacions, 
for soche is more gode of the body þan of the sowle. 
Þanne for the body is iordeyned 
to þe soule 
a[nd] nouƷt aƷenward, 
þan Ʒif felicite is fynal gode 
to the whoche oþer gode is iordeyned, 
soche gode schal nouƷt be iset 
in sencible voluptuose delectaciouns, 
þat beth the gode of þe body, 
bote more in workes 
and dedes of vertues 
þat beth þe gode of the saule. 
And we may saye that theigh som delectaciouns 
be leeffol and honest, 
for dedes of vertue [ben] 
fol likyng to a good man and vertuouse, 
Ʒit none delectacioun ese ileche felicite, 
þei it may be som what þat folweth felicite. 
Bote þe declaracioun þerof longeth nouƷt 
to this present worke. 
But notheles, 
o cause sum what þerof schal be yseyde in[ne]rmore, 
but notheles it is ynowƷ to wite 
þat it is noƷth semelich for a man 
to sette 
is felicite 
in sencible delectaciouns. 
Þan it is detestable 
and horrible to euerich man 
to sette is felicite 
in voluptuose delectaciouns, 
and is most detestable 
and horrible to a kyng. 
And þat may be declared by þre weyes: 
þe furste, 
soche thinges beþ deceytes 
and horrible to a kyng, 
for ‡ soche abateth moste 
and bereth hym doun. Þe secunde, 
fore thei maken hym be despised 
and lyte itolde of. 
Þe þridde, 
for a maketh hym vnworthy to be a prince. 
Hit is iseide tofore 
that in voluptuouse lyf we accordeth with other bestes. 
And thei that desireth to lyue 
in that wise cheseth þe lif 
of vnresonable bestes. 
Þanne in þe more hiƷ state a man is, 
þe more he is ibore idoune 
by his lif. 
For it is iseide 
that it semeth a kyng 
and a prince 
to be aboue man, 
and al fol lord, 
for it is seide, 
v Poleticorum, 
þat a principate schal answere to the quantite and worthines so 
þat þe more grete prince a‡ man is, 
þe more he schal passe oþer | in worthines 
and in dignite of lyf 
and in quantite of godenes. 
Þanne it is vnworthi 
that he that is so grete a gre scholde chese the maner lyuyng of vnresonable bestes, 
for þerby he is swithe ibore dounward. 
Þe secounde, 
þat maketh þe kyng despised 
and litel isette 
by is detestable to hym. 
Þerfore, v Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
that it is most spedefol to princes 
to be moderate 
in bodilich delectacions and likyng, 
and seith thare that thei 
that haueth ham to soche delectacions 
and likyng beth liche 
to dronken men 
and to slepyng men. 
For thei that Ʒeueth ham to soche 
likynge leseth þe vse of resoun 
as doth slepyng men 
and dronken men 
and mowe nouƷt vse resoun, 
and he seith that the sobre man 
is nouƷt sone despised, 
bote þe dronken man; 
nother the wakyng man 
is sone despised 
bote þe slepyng man. 
Þanne it semeth a kyng to voide 
and forsake soche 
inmoderate likyng 
þat a seme nouƷt contemptible, 
that is despisyng and worthi to be despised. 
Þe þridde, it semeth a prince 
[þat soche þinges be despised, 
lest he bycome unworþi to be princej. 
For no man cheseth Ʒungelynges to be dukes, 
for it is vnworthy 
þat a childe be a prince. 
Bote as it is iseide, primo Ethicorum, 
no differens is bytwene a child of Ʒong age 
and one with maneres of Ʒong age, 
for on þat vseth soche likyng. 
For thei he be olde of tyme and of age, 
for a is a child in maneres, 
he [is] vnworthi to be a prince. 
Þanne it is diligentlich to wetyng 
þat as a child of age and a childe of maneres 
bien nouƷt diuers 
to be olde of age and of maneres, 
þerfore an olde man of age 
and childe of maneres 
is vnworthi to be a prince, 
so a childe of age 
and olde of maneres 
is worthi to be a prince. 
For the philosofer seith nouƷt 
that no man cheseth cheldren to be dukes, 
for it is iknowe 
that they ben nouƷt wise, 
bote for it is nouƷt iknowe 
þat thei bien wise. 
Þarfor Ʒif it is iknowe 
þat thei hauen olde maneres 
and bien wise | and redy, 
it is worthi that thei be princes. Þanne by this the conclusioun of þe chapiter, 
that a prince be nouƷt ibore doun 
noþer contempte and despised, 
nother be vnworthy to be prince, 
a schal despise inmoderate and voluptuose likynge. Chapter VII Þe philosofer, Politicorum primo, 
distingueth twey maner of riches, 
and meneth that som maner of riches is kyndelich, 
and som is crafty riches. 
Kyndelych riches is icleped 
þat comeþ kyndelich of kyndelich thinges, 
as what cometh of feldes 
oþer of treen, 
as corne and wyne, 
oþer of bestes; 
also generallich al that serueth to mete and drynke and cloþyng ys acounted among kyndeliche riches. 
Crafty riches is ifounde by crafte 
and by wit and ordinans of men ichaunged for kyndeliche riches 
as gold and siluer and al maner money 
þat releueth nouƷt by hamself bodylich nedes, 
bote by chaungyng 
a helpeth and releueth in bodelich nedes. 
ÞeiƷ gold and siluer be kynde metal 
Ʒit þei hauen crafty riches. 
In nother richesse schal felicite be iset. 
Primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer toucheth thre by þe whoche we may declare 
þat felicite schal nouƷt be iset in crafty riches. First, 
for craftes is iordeyned 
to kynde riche[s]; 
þe secunde, 
for soche riches is imade riches by manis ordynans; 
þe þridde, 
for a releueth noƷt bodelich 
nede by kynde þerof. 
Hit is iseid tofore 
þat felicite schal be iset in þat gode to þe which oþer good is iordened; ‡ and so, 
for crafti is iordeyned 
to kynde richesse, 
crafti riches may nouƷt haue þe reson of felicite. 
Þe secounde, 
þan felicite schal nouƷt be isette in soche riches, 
for it is nouƷt richese bote 
by ordinauns of men. 
Bote oure verrey felicite 
is oure goode by itself, 
and nouƷt by ordinauns of men onlich. 
Money is riches by ordenans of men, and so, primo Poleticorum, 
it is iseid 
þat Ʒif disposicioun of men 
þat vseþ [were ichaunged], 
oþer 
[Ʒi]f þe ordre and disposicioun [of men] were ichaunged, 
þan were suche richesse nouƷt worƷt; 
for þat so moche money is worthy | 
so moche whete, 
þat is by ordynance of men 
and for men 
þat vseth money 
wol and ordeyneth 
þat it be so. 
Þe þridde, 
that in soche riches schal nouƷt felicite be isette; 
for nother gold ne siluer, 
nother money nouƷt onlich 
fulfilleth noght the saule 
nother his parfite goode, 
bote also a releueth nouƷt 
by hamsilf bodylich nede. 
Hit may happe 
as it is iseide, 
primo Polleticorum, 
that a riche man of money 
deyeth for hunger. 
And þat hit is iseide of on Meda, 
þat was swithe coueitous of golde, 
and as it is iseide in fables, 
he preyed god 
and hadde it igraunte 
þat al þat he touched schulde torne to gold, 
and for the touche 
is in every party of the body 
he myƷt touche no thing 
in his mouthe 
bote it tomede in to gold, 
and so he was a riche man of gold 
and deide Ʒit for honger. 
And that myƷt nouƷt be Ʒif gold and money were verrey riches and releuede verreyliche bodiliche nede. 
And for money is riches 
in order to oþer richesse 
and also for money is riches 
by ordinauns of men, 
also þeiƷ a be bodiliche, 
money is nouƷt suffisaunt 
by itself 
to relyue bodiliche nede, 
þanne felicite schal nouƷt be iset tharinne. 
And that felicite schal [nouƷt] be iset in kynde riches 
as in mete and drynke, 
and in soche thinges 
þat releueth hamself bodiliche nede, 
it may sone be declared. 
For by cause þat felicite 
is the beste goode, 
it schal be isouƷt in [the beste] party of vs. Þanne 
for the saule is better þan þe body, 
felicite schal nouƷt be iset in þat þat is þe goode of the body. 
Bote as it is isaide 
felicite schal be iset 
in dedes of vertues 
and þat is the goode of þe soule. 
Þanne to eueriche man 
it is detestable and horribele 
to sette his felicitee in riches, 
and to a kyng 
it is most detestable 
and horrible 
to sette his felicite on riches. 
For [Ʒif] a kyng oþer a prince setteth his felicite in riches, 
þre grete harmes cometh þerof. 
Þe furste, 
þat he leseth grete thinges; 
þe seconde, 
þat he is 
i|mad a tiraunt; 
the þridde, 
þat he aspoileþ þe poeple. 
He þat loueth 
as for þe fynal ende 
and dredeth to Ʒeue money 
may neuer be magnificus 
man of grete expens and cost, 
nother a may be magnanimus, 
for he þat dredeth to luse money 
vndertaketh none grete dedes. 
Þanne, 
for he is magnanimus 
þat holdeth no bodilich thing 
grete as þe philosofer meneth, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
capitulo De Magnanimitate. 
For a coueitouse man 
þat setteth his felicitee 
in riches holdeth riches a gret thing, 
soche one may nouƷt be magnanimus. 
And for magnificencia, 
þe vertue of grete spens and cost, 
and magnanimitas, 
þe vertue of grete vndertakyng, 
ben moste goode and most semeliche to a kyng, 
þanne it is detestable and horrible to hym 
to sette his felicitee in riches. 
Þe seconde, 
it is detestable to a kyng 
oþer to a prince 
to sette his felicite in riches, 
for þanne a ys imade a tyraunt. 
For ther is diuersite 
bytwene a kyng and a tyraunt 
as it schal be declared 
in þe þridde book, 
þer it schal be treted of gouernans 
and reulyng of rengnes. 
He is propreliche a kyng þat setteth his entent 
on profite of þe regne 
and of þe comyn profite. 
And Ʒif his entent be iset 
on his owne profit, 
þat folweth þat oþer. 
Bote a tyraunt doþ þe contrary, 
for his entent is principaliche 
on his owne profite. 
And Ʒif his entent is on þe comyn profite, 
þat is by cause of his owne profite 
and loueth most his owne profit. 
He þat setteth his felicite 
in money principallych wol gadre money 
and tresour to hymself, 
and is therfore a tyraunt and nouƷt a kyng, 
for his entent is nouƷt principalich 
on þe comyn profite bote on his owne. 
Þe þridde, 
Ʒif it were so 
þat the kyng spoilede þe puple, 
for the ende is so iloued 
þat eueriche man studieth 
to com to his felicite 
in al maner wise 
þat a can and may, 
þan he þat setteth his felicite in riches reccheth nouƷt þeigh | 
a pile wedewes and fader 
and moderles children 
and spoile þe comonte and þe regne 
while he may gadre money. 
He þat knoweth what þe ende is to menyng knoweth 
þat a man fondeth 
in al maner wise 
that he may come to his ende. 
Þanne a kyng is a tyraunt 
Ʒif he wol be a lord 
and nouƷt helpe a comyn profite, 
bote spoileth the poeple 
and doþ ham no gode bote harme. 
And so [i]f hit is [d]etestable and horryble to a kyng 
to luse þe beste gode 
and be a tyraunt and a þef, 
it is detestable and horrible to hym 
and sette his felicitee in riches. Chapter VIII 
On cause meny men 
þat leueth most politik 
lif weneth and troweth 
þat ‡ felicite schal be isette 
in worshippe – for citeseyns, 
for the moste dele, moste desireth worschippe. 
In worschep þre beth to knowyng 
by the whoche we may by þre weyes declare þat felicite schal nouƷt be iset in worschippe. 
Þe furste, 
for worscheppe is gode iordeyned to other; 
þe seconde, worschippe is outward good; 
þe þridde, 
worschippe is more in hym that worscheppeth þan in hym 
þat is iworschepped. 
Bote felicite is nouƷt goode iordeyned to oþer, 
bote felicite is gode to þe whoche oþer gode is iordeyned, 
and is nouƷt outward gode 
bote inward gode, 
and ys in hym 
þat is felix and hath felicite. 
Þat worschippe is gode iordeyned to oþer þe philosofer witnesseth, primo Ethicorum, 
and seith 
þat worschippe 
is doyng of reuerence and witnes of vertue, 
þat for men desireth 
most to be worschepped 
for to seme 
and be holde wise and vertues, 
for soche men beth moste worthi 
to haue worschippe. 
Þerfore þe philosofer | 
seith that no man telleth pris 
to be worshepped of children, 
for here reuerens is nouƷt suffisaunt witnes of wisdom and of vertu. 
Þerfore Ʒif worschep is good iordeyned to vertues, 
felicite schal nouƷt 
be iset in worschip bote rather in vertues 
other in dedes of vertues. 
Þe secunde, felicite schal nouƷt be isett in worschepe, 
for worschepe is outward gode 
and nouƷt inward goode. 
It is iseide 
þat worschipe is reuerens ido 
in tokene 
o[r] witnes of vertue; 
and tokene and witnes mot be openlich and iknow, 
yf a schal make the thyng 
þat he witnesseth fol knowe. 
And inward thinges 
beth nouƷt iknowe 
to vs bote outwarde thinges, 
for we knoweth nouƷt what a man thinketh on his herte, 
bote [w]e knoweth what reuerens presenteth withoute. 
Þanne þe reuerens, 
þat is worschepe, 
Ʒif a schal showe his vertue 
to wham it is ido, 
it suffiseth nouƷtþat it be in þouƷt and in herte bote it be is[h]owed outward, 
and worschipe is outward gode 
for it is reuerens ido 
by outward tokenes and signes; 
wharfore, Ʒif felicite schal nouƷt be iset in outter gode, 
þat is þe lasse goode, 
bote inner gode, 
þat is þe more goode, 
þan felicite schal nouƷt be iset in worschipe. 
Þe þridde, 
þat same is ipreued, 
for worschepe is more in hym þat worschepith þan in hym þat is iworschepped, 
as þe philosofer seith, primo Ethicorum. 
Wherefore Ʒif felicitee 
is iset in worschep, 
þan happeth þat horrible peruersite 
þat 
[felicite]e is more in hym þat is iworschepped 
þan in hym þat worscheppeth. 
And as it is seide in a prouerbe, 
ientry is in hym þat doþ it, 
so worscheppe is more in hym 
þat doth worscheppe þan in hym þat is iworschepped. 
And this is openlich iknowe, 
for Ʒif a man loteþ 
to another and doþ hym worschepe, 
he þat louteþ 
is the worschep 
in hym that louteth and nouƷt | 
in hym to wham þe loutyng is imade to, 
for þe dede is proprelich 
in þe subget and nouƷt in þe obiect. 
And Ʒif þe acte 
and dede is in eny wise in þe obiect Ʒit he is more in þe subiecte 
þan þe obiect. 
Þanne this loutyng and reuerens 
is more in hym þat louteth and doþ 
þe reuerens in þe whoche he is as in þe subiect, 
þan in hym to wham þe reuerens is idoun 
whan a is as in þe obiect. 
Þanne it is wel iseide 
þat reuerens and worschipe 
is more in hym þat doth reuerens and worschepe 
þan in hym þat is iworschepped. 
Þanne, 
for felicite is most in hym 
þat is felix and ioyful, 
felicite schal nouƷt be iset in worschepe. 
Þanne it is vnsemeliche to eueriche man to set his felicite 
in worschippe and trowe 
þat a ys felix 
and in fol ioye and welthe Ʒif 
a ys iworschepped of al men, 
and þat is most vnsemelich to a kyng. 
And þat we may declare by þre weyes, 
for Ʒif a kyng setteþ his felicite 
in worschep hym folweth þre harmes; 
for þanne a semeth goode 
and is nouƷt good, 
and is presumptuouse and vnriƷthful. 
For Ʒif a prince setteþ his felicite in worscheppe, 
and it suffiseth to ‡ a man 
þat scholde be iworschepped 
þat a seme goode, 
þanne suche reccheth nouƷt to be good in dede. 
Þerfore [in] Politi[is] 
þe philosofer seith þat thei that telleth so grete pris of worschippe 
bien faitours and semeth gode 
and ben nouƷt gode in dede. 
Þanne it is moste semelich 
to a kyng 
to be goode in dede. 
Þanne it is most vnsemelich to hym 
to sette his felicitee in worschippe, 
lest he be a faitour, 
semyng goode and nouƷt goode in dede. 
Þe secunde, 
it is vnsemelyche to a kyng 
to sette his felicite in worschippe, 
for þerby he schold brynge þe puple in grete peril, 
for while þe ende is most desired and iloued Ʒif a prince setteþ his felicite in worschepe, 
for to haue | worscheppe 
he wol putte his men 
and poeple to al maner peril. 
Here of we hauen ensample of þe sone 
of a certeyn prince of Rome 
that het Torquatus. 
Þis sone desired moche worschippe 
and putte hym in peril in bataille 
aƷenst his fader heste. 
And for oþer scholde nouƷt take 
ensample þerby and desire moche worscheppe, 
this Torquatus prince of Rome 
slouƷ his owne sone 
þat was so coueitous and presumptuouse, 
nouƷt withstonding þat his sone 
hadde þe victorie 
and maystrie of his enemye. 
Þat a prince be nouƷt hed strong, 
nother to hasti, 
noþer presumptuouse, 
it is nouƷt spedeful 
to a kyng 
to sette his felicite in worschippe. 
Þe þridde, 
þat is vnsemelich to a kyng 
for a schold nouƷt be vnriƷtful. 
For it is semelich to a prince 
to dele his goode 
as persones ben worthi, 
so þat a Ʒeue more gode 
to wise men worthi 
þan to vnworthi men and mynystrals. 
Bote Ʒif a prince setteth his felicite 
in worschepe 
for þe ende is moste iloued, 
a reccheth nouƷt to rewarde persones 
as þei bien worthi, 
bote he wol dele his good onliche in soche a maner 
as he may gete moste worschippe. 
Þanne Ʒif a kyng setteth his felicite in worschippe 
a schal be euel in hymself, 
for a rechcheth nouƷt bote 
to be iholde goode; 
and a schal be euel to þe puple 
þat is vnder hym, 
for a spareth nouƷt to putte ham presumptuousliche 
and hastelich to peril; 
and schal be euel 
in his owne good, 
for a deleth [nouƷt] his good to persones as bien worthi. Chapter IX Fama, 
þat is loos, 
and gloria bien oþer 
þan worschippe and preysyng. 
For worschippe and preysyng 
bien cause of fama and of gloria. 
A man is in fama and in gloria, 
for a is ipreised and iworschepped, 
and worschep is oþer þan preysyng, 
for worschepe is more general and comyn þan preysyng; 
for properliche preysyng 
is nouƷt bote by spekyng, 
bote | worschippe 
is by al other outward signes. 
And so it is iseide, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
þat parties of worschep bien sacrefice, knelyng, and loutyng, 
and settyng tofore in metre 
and in bedes biddyng, 
and suche outward signes 
þat perteyneth to reuerens and worschippe. 
And gloria and fama bien ofte itake al one and þe same, 
for gloria is a certeyn clere knowleche 
for a certeyn man. 
For gloria is a certeyne clemes, 
and þis same is fame, 
for fame is a certeyn clere knowleche with preysing. 
Bote Ʒif we wolle in eny wise distingue 
bitwene gloria and fama, 
we schold say þat fama cometh of gloria. 
Þanne is þe o[rdre] 
þat gloria cometh of worschepe, 
and in grete array he semeth clere and gloriouse. 
And fame cometh of worschep and of gloria. 
For Ʒif a man is in worschippe and in gloria, 
þanne a ys in fame and in reputacioun. 
For to take gloria and fama largeliche in þat wise and for al is in one and þe same. 
Þanne for man myƷt wene þat felicite scholde be iset in fame and gloria, 
for that þerby his name 
may be wide isprad 
and in to diuers londes and dure longe tyme. 
Also it semeth þat a prince scholde þerinne sette his felicite; 
for, v Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat þe meyde 
þat schal be iƷeue 
to princes 
is worschep and gloria. 
And Ʒif þei beth noƷt apaied þerwith, 
þanne þei bien tirauntƷ. 
Bote þis may nouƷt stonde, 
and þat we may declare by þre weyes. 
For as it perteyneth to this worke, 
and as it is iseide 
tofore honde atte folle, 
felicite is nouƷt 
onlich signe of goode bote 
it is also parfite gode 
and suffisaunt by hitself. 
Þe seconde, felicite is onliche in gode men 
and ioyful and nouƷt in euel men and schrewednes. 
Þe þridde, 
it is in inward goode 
and nouƷt in outward goode. 
And fame is aƷeward, 
for fame is signe of goodnes more 
þan it is 
gode|nes and perteyneth nouƷt 
onlich to gode men 
bote to meny euel men. 
‡ Also fama is more in outward signes þanne in þe inner goodnes. 
A man hath fame among men 
for he is clerlich and worthilich iknowe among men. 
And for [ou]re sciens and knowyng is nouƷt þe þynges 
þat we knoweth, 
nother cause þerof, 
bote it is signe of þe thinges 
ben cause þerof, 
þanne fame is nouƷt [ou]re godenes, 
noþer [ou]re goodnes dependeth þerof: 
bote fame is onlich 
an outward signe 
of [ou]re goodnes. 
Þanne [ou]re felicite is nouƷt in fame. 
Þe secunde, 
þat it may nouƷt stonde, 
for nouƷt onlich gode men 
haueth gloria and fame among hem 
bote also euel men and schrewes. For ofte we beth bygeled in demyng 
þat horrible peruersite and errour happeth ofte tyme, 
þat good men and worþy beth nouƷt itold of, 
and euel and schrewes beth in fame and gloria. 
Þe thridde, 
þat felicite is nouƷt in fame, 
for fame stondeth more in outward signes 
þan inward goodnes, 
for man seeth nouƷt bote outward þynges; 
for we seeth nouƷt þe þouƷttes of herte, 
nother vertues ne malis of þouƷt and of herte. 
Bote Ʒif we demeth a man vertuouse and goode, 
þat is by outward signes 
þat we seeth and knoweth; 
for a man to be iworschepped, 
it suffiseth þat a seme goode outward. 
So for a man to be in gloria and fame among men, 
hit suffiseth as it semeth 
þat a seme a goode man outward. 
Þerfore for it is semelich 
þat a kyng be al good, 
as it were an half god, 
and it is inconuenient 
to sette felicite in þing 
þat is signe of goodnes ‡ more 
þan it is godnesse, 
in þyng in þe which euel men 
and schrewes beth, 
and stondeth more in outward thinges 
þan in inward godenes: 
þanne it is inconuenient 
to a kyng to trowe þat he is in felicite, 
þeiƷ he be | famous and gloriouse among men and puple. 
Panne a kyng schal noujt trowe 
that he is in felicitee and goode, 
theigh he be in gloria among men and puple. 
Bote a is blisfol Ʒif 
a is gloriouse anon to God. 
It is iseide þat gloria and fama 
is a certeyne clere knowynge with preysyng. 
As longeth herto, 
in þre wise [ou]re knowyng 
and Goddes knowyng ‡ bien diuers: 
for Goddes knowyng 
is cause of thinges, 
and thinges bien [‡] cause of [‡ourei knowyng, 
as þe comentour seithe, 
xii Metaphisice. 
Also Goddis knowyng is infallible, 
and [ou]re knowyng fayleþ ofte tyme. 
Also Goddys knowyng 
is of inward þynges, 
and [ou]re knowyng strecheþ 
by hymself and forþ riƷt 
only to outward þynges. 
Þanne [ou]re goodnes and knowyng is dependaunt of Goddes knowyng 
as þe effecte is dependaunt of his cause. 
Aboute oure goodnes, 
Goddes knowyng failleth nouƷt, 
fore his knowyng may nouƷt faille. 
Also God seith oure inward godnes and malis. 
Þanne it may nouƷt be 
þat God accounteth a man in gloria and in fame 
oþer in clere knowyng with preysyng, 
bote þat man be gode 
and in welthe as his state axeth. 
ÞeiƷ it be so of knowyng ‡ of God 
and of his accountyng of gloria and fame, 
Ʒit is nouƷt felicite in gloria and fame 
þat is among men. 
And for it is iseide 
þat fama 
þat is among men dureth long and springeth wide, 
þe contrary myƷt be iseide, 
þat it is schort duryng and springeth 
bote in litel place, 
for Bois seith þat þe fame 
of þe Romayns 
passede neuer þe hulle, 
Mont [Cauc]asum. 
Þanne how schulde þe fame 
of one man springe 
in to alle þe worlde wide? 
Bote for in comparisoun to heuene, 
al þe erþe is as it were a poynt, 
and astronomers telleth that the leste notabel sterre 
þat [is] isee in heuene is more þanne al þe | erthe, 
þanne mannis fame 
spredeth bote litel 
and is in litel place. 
Al soche fame 
is schort and dureth bote a while, 
for al þe tyme of þis lyf 
is as it were a poynt 
in comparisoun to þe lif 
þat euere schal leste. 
For the resounhabele saule deyeth nouƷt, 
felicite schal be iset þerinne, 
for felicite schal be iset in thing 
þat may dure for euermore. 5 10 
It was iseide þat kynges scholde haue to here mede gloria and worschep; 
bote þe philosofer his text 
is nouƷt vnderstonde in þis wise, 
þat kynges scholde axe principallich for here mede and fame among men, 
fore þanne here fruyte were lite. 
Bot þat is iseid 
for it is semelich 
þat kynges and prynses 
ben men 
of grete dedes and cost. 
And theigh men of grete cost 
haue nouƷt here entent principallich in worschippe 
bote in goode and in catel, 
Ʒit me doth ham worschepe; 
and it is semeliche 
þat þey alowe þe worschipe 
þat is ido to ham, 
whanne men haueþ none gretter myude to quyte ham, 
as it is iseide, iiii Ethicorum, 
nouƷt þat worschep is ful mede 
and quytyng to ham, 
as it is þar iseide. 
Bote fongyng and alowyng of worschipe 
as for folle quityng and mede 
may be vnderstonde in twey wise, 
oþer by cause of worschip in itself, 
oþer by cause of þe affeccioun of þe men 
þat doþ þe worschep. 
Worschep in itself 
is nouöt bote signe and witnes of goodnes, 
as it is ischowed; 
and so worschipe is nouƷt ful quytyng and mede. 
Bote by cause of affeccioun of ham 
þat doþ þe worschepe, 
it is a manere couenable quytyng. 
For while þei þat doþ 
þe worschipe haueþ none gretter mede to quyte, 
it is semelich þat a prince allowe þe worschippe 
þat is ido in þat wise. 
Þerfore as it is pleynlich iknowe in soche quytyng, 
þe affeccioun of ham 
þat doþ | þe worschipe is allowed, 
nouƷt propreliche þe worschep is allowed. 
Bote Ʒif princes aloweth nouƷt þe affeccioun of men 
þat doþ ham moche worschepe, 
bote chalengeth and axeth of men 
þat ben vnder ham other outward gode and catel, 
as gold and siluer and other riches, 
þanne þei bien tirauntes, 
for Ʒif þei doun 
so thei despoilen þe poeple. Chapter X 
In libro De Re Militari 
it semeth þat Vegesius preyseth wit and sligh craft of batails 
ouer al þynges, 
for as he seith principallich 
þat brouƷt vp þe Romayns for þey Ʒaue hymself most to bataills 
and to dedes of armes, 
and studiede with al here myƷt how 
and in what wise þey myƷte make sogette 
to ham nacioun and poeple. 
Þarfore he seeth a prince 
his principale intent 
schold be to haue grete cyuyle myƷt and strengthe, 
and þerby to make men and naciouns sogette to hym. 
Ʒif it were so, 
it wolde seme þat a kyng scholde sette his felicite in cyuyle myƷt and strengþe. 
And þat is fals, 
for, vii Poleticorum, 
the philosofer preueth by fyue resons 
þat felicite schal nouƷt be iset in ciuile miƷt and strengthe. 
Þe furste way is itake 
for suche a principate dureth nouƷt ful longe tyme; 
þe secounde, 
for non verrey prince 
is withoute godenes of lif; 
þe þridde, 
for he is [vn]worthi; 
þe ferde, 
for by soche 
a principate men ben iordeyned 
to lasse gode and profite; 
þe fifte, 
for comonliche soche lordschipe is greuous and noyfol. 
Þe furste wey is declared in this wise, 
for he þat wol make men 
and naciouns soget to hym by cyuyl myƷt 
and strengthe wol be prince 
and lord by violens, 
and violens is nouƷt perpetual, 
and violent thinges duret nouƷt longe. 
Soche principate may nouƷt longe dure. 
Bote as þe fure is 
by kynde hote | 
and worcheth kyndelich 
whanne it heteth, 
so whanne a man is set kyndelich in fre wille, 
þanne he hath kynde lordschip of men, 
whanne he is prince 
ouer hym frelich 
and by gode wille. 
And þat is whanne þe poeple doþ 
þe prince his hestes frelich 
and with gode wille. 
Þanne a kyng schal nouƷt trowe 
þat he is in welþe 
and in felicite Ʒif he is a lord by violens 
and by cyuyle myƷt and strengthe. 
For soche lordschipe is violent and aƷens kynde 
and may nouƷt longe dure. 
Felicite schal nouƷt be iset in þyng þat passeth, 
bote in thing 
þat lesteþ euermore. 
Þe secounde, felicite schal nouƷt be iset in cyuyle myƷt and strengthe, 
for þat may be ihad withoute goodnes of lyf. 
As it is iseide tofore, 
felicite is parfite gode and suffisaunt by itself. 
Hit is inpossible 
þat þe beste gode 
is in eny man bote a lyue wel and be fol gode, 
as it is inpossible 
þat grete whitenes be in a body bote 
þat body be fol white. 
And þat cyuyle myƷt and strengthe myƷt 
be had withoute godenes of lyf, 
it may be preued by thinges 
þat we hauen iseie in olde tyme. 
For we hauen iseye many ful euel tyrauntes 
haue grete cyuyle myƷt and strengthe. 
For Denys Siracusanus oþer Denys Felicianus 
hadde most cyuyle myƷt and strengthe, 
as þe philosofer seith [in] Politidis], 
and was þe worste tiraunt alyue. 
Also Nero and Cesar, princes of Rome, 
had gret cyuyle myƷt 
and strengþe and lyuede atte worste, 
for þey were so lecherous 
þat thei semed wommen 
at alle and were so cruel 
þat no mercy noþer pitee was isey in ham, 
and so, vii Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat it is a scorne to trowe 
þat eny man is felix 
and in welthe Ʒif a leueth nouƷt wel. 
Þan felicite is nouƷt 
in ciuil myƷt and strengþe 
þat may be ihadde withoute godenes | of leuyng. 
Þe þridde, 
felicitee is nouƷt 
in suche myƷt and strengthe, for soche principate 
is nouƷt best nother worthi, 
for Ʒif felicite schal be iset in eny principate, 
it schal be iset 
in þe best principate and worthi; 
and he þat by cyuel myƷt 
and strengþe is prince, 
[is prince] of bonde men 
and þralle and nouƷt of fre men, 
and soche a principate 
is by strengþe 
and by streynyng 
and by violens. 
And principatus bien ilikned 
in comparisoun by ham 
of þe whoche a man is prince, 
and as þe philosofer wol [in] Poletic[is], 
in as moche as fre men bien better 
þan bonde men and þralle, 
in so moche it is bettre and more worthi 
to be prince of fre men 
þan of bonde men and þralle. 
Þanne principate 
þat is by violens and ciuyle myƷt and strengþe is nouƷt best principate noþer worþy, 
fore it is a principate of bonde men and þralle. 
Þerfore, vii Politicorum, 
it is iseide 
þat principate of fre men, 
þat is with vertue, 
is bettre þan principate of bonde men and þralle, 
þat is by violens and þraldome. 
Þe ferde, felicite is nouƷt in cyuyle myƷt and strengþe, 
for Ʒif a prince troweth 
þat a is felix 
and in welthe Ʒif a hath grete ceuyle myƷt and strengthe, 
a wol nouƷtordeyne þe citeseyns 
bote to dedes of armes 
and to make naciouns soget to hym. 
He schal nouƷt þanne brynge þe citeseyns 
to vertue of rightwisenesse 
bote þe vertues of stalwardnes 
and of strengþe; 
and as þe philosofer seith, 
vii Politicorum, riƷthwisnes, iusticia, 
is better þanne strengþe. 
Þan he ordeyneth nouƷt þe citeseyns 
to þe more gode, 
þat is iusticia, 
bote onlich þe lasse gode, 
þat is fortitudo, stalwardnes. 
Þanne laste þe comyn profite persche, 
þat is more godelich 
þan eny synguler profite, 
it semeth nouƷt a prince 
to sette his felicite in cyuyl myƷt and strengþe. 
Þe fifte, 
þat semeth hym nouƷt, 
for soche principate is greuose, 
for [felicitee] is ━þe ende┐ ‡ 
of al workes | and dedes. 
Eueriche man ordeineth al his lif 
and his workes and dedes 
to þat þyng 
in þe whoche a setteth his felicitee. 
Þanne he þat setteth his felicite 
in cyuyle myƷt and strengþe 
and maketh naciouns soget to hym, 
he schal on case bere hym wel in werre tyme. 
Bote he can nouƷt lyue wel 
in tyme of pese, 
for as it fareth of soche a prince, 
for þe more dele a studieth aboute dedes of armes and ordeyneth 
al his lif to stalwardnes 
and nouƷt to iusticia and temporancia, 
and kan nouƷt þerfore leue in tyme of pese, 
in þe whoche tyme nedeþ iusticia and temporancia, 
bote he schal be viciouse and falle in to damage of saule. 
Þerfore þe philosofer, 
vii Politicorum, 
despiseth þe Lacedemones, 
þat setteth here felicite in cyuyle myƷt and strengþe, 
and seith þat is foule 
to be partiners of gode 
in tyme of werre and vicious in tyme of pese. 
Þerfore Ʒif it is inconuenient 
to sette felicitee 
in þyng þat dureth nouƷt longe and in thing þat may be withoute goodnes of leuyng, 
and is vnworthi, 
by þe whoche men beth iordeyned 
to þe lasse gode and profite, 
and greueth ofte tyme; 
and for þe more dele 
it is inconuenient to a prince 
to sette his felicite in cyuyle myƷt and strengþe and to trowe 
þat he is in felicitee Ʒif 
a may make nacions sochet to hymme. Chapter XI 
By thynges þat bien iseide 
it is clere inough þat felicite schal nouƷt be iset in bodilich gode, 
bote as it semeth þre maner bodilich gode men desireth moste: hele, feymes and strengþe, 
and meny setteth hire felicite 
in soche gode of þe body. 
Bote it semeth contrari to gode of þe body 
and gode of þe saule; 
for þe lasse is ihad of gode of þe body, 
þe more it is desired; 
for ar soche gode be ihad, 
it is iholde beter þan it is. 
And whanne soche gode is ihad 
it semeth nouƷt so | gode as it is iholde. 
Bote it is aƷeward of gode of þe saule, 
for whanne it is ihad 
it is ifounde better þanne it was iholde. 
Þerfore som þat knoweth nouƷt þe swetnes of wit and of wisdom blameth ham 
þat studien and bien ioccupied 
in philosophi and in sciens, 
for a knoweth nouƷt þe goodnes and swetnes þerof; 
[for Ʒif a knoweth þe goodnes and swetnes þerof] 
he wolde nouƷt onlich blame ham 
þat Ʒeueth ham to worldelich riches, 
bote he wolde also scorny al þat þat Ʒeueth ham nouƷt to vertues and to sciens. 
For bodilich gode, 
ar it be ihad, 
semeth beter þan it is. 
Meny þat lakkeþ bodilich gode desireth it hogelich and troweth 
þat it [is] so excellent 
þat Ʒif þei hadde soche gode a wolde wene þat a were in welthe and in felicitee. 
Þarfore, primo Ethicorum, 
it is iseide 
þat sike men setteth here felicite in hele and beggers 
in riches and fowle men 
in feymes and feble men in strengþe. 
Bote þat felicite is nouƷt in strengþe, 
nother in feyrnes, 
noþer in hele, 
we may declare by þre weyes. 
Þe furste, 
for soche gode is bodilich goode; 
þe seconde, 
for soche gode 
is som dele outward goode; 
þe þridde, 
for soche gode is varryable and chaungeth sone. 
Soche gode is bodilich gode 
for it is igrounded in þe body, 
for hele is in þe humoris 
and feyrnes in þe membres, 
and strengthe in bones and synewes. 
For as þe philosofer meneth, 
iii De Elegendis, 
hele is thiwe euenes [of] humours, 
and feyrnes is þeiwe proporcioun of membres, 
and strengthe is thuwe proporcioun of bones and of synwes; 
and so for humors, membres, synwes and bones bien bodilich hele, 
feyrnes and strengþe bien bodilich þynges. 
Þanne felicite schal nouƷt be iset þerinne. 
Þe secunde, felicite schal noƷt be iset in soche gode, 
fore it is som dele outward gode, 
for as þe philosofer seith, 
man is more verrailiche þe inwyt þan þe outter felyng, 
and þe saule hath more | 
of þe resoun of man 
þan þe body, 
and al[wey] þe fourme hath more verrey kynde of a þyng þanne þe mater. 
Þanne þe gode of þe saule 
is oure best inward gode. 
Þanne felicite schal nouƷt be iset in hele, feyrnes, 
nother in strengþe of body, 
bote in hele, feymes, 
and strengthe of saule. 
Þanne a man 
ne schal nouƷt trowe 
þat he is in felicite 
and in welthe, 
þeigh he haue temporate humors 
and hele of body, 
nother þeiƷ þey hauen semelich membres and lemes, 
and be feire and semelich, 
noþer þeiƷ he haue proporcionate bones 
and synwes 
and be strong of body. 
Bote [Ʒif] his vertues ben euene 
and þe neþer vertues soget to resoun, 
and Ʒif he is hole and strong in soule, 
and [Ʒif] soche vertues bien ihiƷt 
with gode thewes and maner 
and with gode workes and dede, 
so þat he is feyre in sawle, 
þanne as his state axeth 
he schal trowe 
that he is felix and in welthe. 
And we seyn, 
as his astate axeth, 
for in this lif 
may nouƷt be fol felicite. 
Hele, fayrnes and strengthe ben outward good; 
þerfore felicite schal nouƷt be iset þerinne. 
And þat felicitee is onlich inward gode proprelich þe philosofer witnesseth, 
vii Poleticomm, 
and seith God 
is oure witnes 
þat felicite schal be iset [in] inward gode, 
for God witnesseth 
þat by hymself, 
as he seith. 
Therefor God 
is nouƷt blisful by outward gode, 
bote by gode 
þat is in hymself. 
Þanne Ʒif þe blisful saule is ilikned to God, 
he is nouƷt [blisful] bote by god 
þat is in þe same saule. 
10 Þe þridde, 
felicitee schal nouƷt [be] iset in suche goode, 
for it is ful variable and vnstedefaste; 
for euenesse of humors is vnder þe meuyng 
of þe sterres and planettes 
and varieth sone, 
and chaungeth by chaungyng 
of þe eire 
and of mete and drynke. 
Bote Ʒif hele failleth, 
þanne failleth bodyly strengþe, 
for þanne þe membres slaketh 
and þe senewes bien feble, 
and þerby proporcioun | 
of bones fayleth and of synewys, 
in þe whiche is þe myƷt 
and þe strengþe of body. 
Also in þe same wise, 
Ʒif hele failleth, 
fayrnesse failleth. 
For þanne þe membris bien lewed, 
and colour þerof passeth 
in þe proporcioun 
in þe whiche is fairenesse ikept and isaued. 
Þanne it is not semelich to a kyng noþer anoþer man 
to sette his felicite 
in suche goode, 
for it is bodilich 
and som del outward good 
and chaungeth sone. 
Þanne to þe menyng 
of al þat is iseide, 
it semeth nouƷt a prince 
to sette his felicitee 
in voluptuous and bodilich likyng, 
nother in riches, 
nother in worschepe, 
nother in fame, 
nother in cyuyle myƷt and strengþe, 
noþer in hele, 
noþer in strengþe, 
noþer in fayrenes of body. 
But al þes thinges he schal vse 
þat he may þerby come to felicite. 
He schal vse mete and drynke 
in þe whiche his body [hath] likyng for conseruacioun and sauyng of his owne lif and of his persone; 
for by cause þat he is heed of þe regne, 
of lacke of hym myƷt come moche harme in to þe comyntee. 
And he schal vse þe dede of wedlok 
for getyng of children, 
for by cause of defaute of children 
and of heyres many rewmes bien deuyded and destroyed. 
For whanne princes deieth withoute children many ariseth 
for to be lordes 
and makeþ dessencioun among þe poeple. 
Also a prince schal haue suffisaunt richesse 
þat he may deffende þe regne 
and vse dedes of vertues. 
Also it semeth a kyng to be magnificus, 
þat he may avaunce worthi persones; 
and þat may noƷt be withoute richesse. 
For to telle prise of þe kyng, 
þe kyng most haue worschep. 
And it is worschepful, spedful, 
þat he haue cyuyle myƷt and strengþe, 
for ofte me telleth litel of þe prince 
that hath litel power of ciuil strengþe, 
and for defaute þerof many doþ euel and greuen oþer men 
and þat is harm to þe regne. 
Also a prince schal telle price of good fame, 
for þerby þe sogettes bien | ibrouƷt to vertue, 
for ofte soche as þe prince is, 
suche is þe puple; 
for whanne þe prince is good, 
þe sugettes taken for to do wel. 
Also hele, feirness and strengþe semeth a prince, 
not for þerinne is proporliche felicite, 
bote for þerby a cometh to felicite. 
Þanne suche good schal be iloued in þat he helpeth to felicitee 
and to somme of clernesse of felicite. 
Þerfore here of how he schal be iloued 
we passeth schortíiche; 
for here of inneremore we schal som what trete. Chapter XII 
Twey felicitees þe philosofer setteth. 
Þe oon is politik and þe oþer is contemplatif. 
He wol not sette felicite 
in strengþe [‡ oþer in] myƷt 
and vertues of þe soule, 
for þerinne boþe gode 
and euel bien conteyned; 
nother in habitis of þe saule, 
for they þat haueth habit 
and wercheth nouƷt 
is likned to a slepyng man. 
While men slepeth, 
semeth no diuersite 
bytwene hem 
[þat bien wrecched] 
and men þat bien in felicite, 
as þe philosofer meneþ primo Ethicorum. 
Þan felicite schal be set in dede and worchyng of þe soule 
and noƷt in worchyng of a vice, 
bote in worching of a vertue and nouƷt of eueriche vertue bote a parfite vertue. 
Þanne as it is iseid, primo Ethicorum, 
felicite is worchyng 
of þe soule by parfite vertue. 
And þe philosofer moeneth 
þat in pollitik lif þe parfit vertue is prudencia, redynesse; 
and in contemplatif lif þe parfit vertue is sapiencia, wisdom, other methaphysica. 
And he ‡ meneth þat eueriche man 
þat can redilich rewle wel oþer men, 
he is politik felix; 
and he þat can goode skyle in speculacioun 
by methaphysica 
is contemplatif felix. 
Of these twey felicitees 
he makeþ mencioun 
and treteth of politik felicite, primo Ethicorum, 
and of contemplatif felicite in x. And whether it be oon posicioun 
of þe philosofer or [not], 
it longeth not to þis tretes; 
while it may be iknowe 
how a kyng schal | 
sette his felicite 
in dedes of redynes, 
it is to wetyng 
þat it is most semelich 
to a kyng 
to sette his felicite in God hymself. 
And þat we may declare [by þre weyes], 
for a kyng is a man, 
and Godes seruant, 
and rulere of many other. 
In þat he is man 
he hath inwyt and reson; 
and þe good of resoun 
is nouƷt a singuler good, 
for þat is sencible good. Bote þe goode of resoun 
is vniuersal good and intellectuale. 
Þanne for a kyng 
is a man and hath resoun, 
it is semelich 
þat he sette his felicitee in good 
þat is most vniuersal and most intellectuale; 
and þat is God hymself, 
þat is good of al goode, 
for in hym is al goode; 
and is also most vniuersale good and most intellectuale, 
for he is most symple 
and most out of matier. 
Þe secounde, 
it semeth a prince 
to sette his felicite 
in God hymself, 
not oonlich for he is man, 
but also for he is Goddes seruaunt in a special manere. 
For thing þat hath part 
in a þing and vnparfitlich 
is his lyme and his instrument 
þat hath þat þyng essencialliche and parfitliche. 
Þanne for God hath onlich principallich and parfitlich vertue 
and myght to gouerne and to regne, 
but eueriche oþer prince 
and kyng [i]s Godes instrument and seruant; 
and a seruaunt schal sette his reward 
and myude in his lord, 
and byde to fonge it of hym; 
þanne it semeth a kyng 
þat is Goodes seruaunt to sette his felicitee 
in God hymself and abide 
þe rewarde of hym. 
Þe þridde, 
þat semeth a kyng for he is rule[r] of meny, 
for he þat ruleth many schal haue his entent 
in þe comyn profitƷ. 
Þanne he schal sette his felicite in thing 
þat is most good and profitable and comyn good, 
and as it is iseid, 
þat is God hymself. 
Þanne for a kyng is Goddys seruaunt 
and for he hath intellectus and inwit, 
and also for a taketh | heede 
to þe comyn profite, 
he schal sette his felicite in God 
þe whiche he serueth 
and is most intellectuale good 
and most profitable and comune. 
Þanne Ʒif þe kyng schal sette his felicitee in God, 
he mote sette suche felicite 
in doyng of þat vertue 
by þe whiche we beþ most iuned to God, 
and þat is þe doyng of loue and of charitee, 
for loue oneþ and iuneth most. 
And so, iiii De Diuinis Nominibus, 
Denys seith þat loue, 
wheþer it be of kynde, 
oþer of beste, 
oþer of man, 
oþer of angel, 
oþer of God, 
it is a vertue of onynge. 
Þanne in Goddes loue schal ‡ felicite be iset. 
Bote for þe assay þerof is work in dede 
and it is iknowe 
þat on loueth an nother Ʒif he doþ 
what he wol haue ido, 
þanne Ʒif a prince is felix and louyng God 
he schal trowe þat he is felix in doyng 
þat God wol haue ido. 
And of kynges and princes God axeth and chalangeth 
most þat thei rule þe puple 
þat is vnder hem riƷtfulliche 
and holyliche 
by redynesse of lawe. 
Þanne kynges and princes schal sette here felicite 
in dede of redinesse, 
and nouƷt sympleliche, 
bote as charite commaundeth and hoteþ. 
Þerfore in dede of charite felicite schal more be isette þan in dede of redinesse, 
for we beþ nerer ionid to God bi charite þanne by redinesse, 
þeiƷ felicite schal be isette sum del 
in dede of redinesse 
in þe maner 
þat is iseide. Chapter XIII 
A kynges mede is greet 
and his felicitee is greet 
Ʒif he ruleth his poeple rightfulliche 
by redynesse and by lawe, 
and þat we may declare by fyue. 
For as it longeth 
to þis work it semeth 
þat þe kynges myude toucheth 
and longeth to fyue: 
to God þat Ʒeueth it, 
to þe kyng þat fongth it, 
to þe dede of þe whiche it cometh, 
[to] þe vertue by þe whiche it is ido, 
and to þe mater 
in þe whiche it is ido. 
For God rewardeth and quyteth al good 
and for he | rewardeth noƷt bot for loue, 
and for alwey loue 
is to liknes and acoord, 
it nedeth be lyche and accordynge to God, 
who þat desireth to be rewarded of God. 
Þanne þe more a man bereth þe ymage 
and þe more he is accordyng, 
þe more mede he schal haue of God. 
A princes state wol þat he be more 
þan his sogettis accordyng to God. 
And Ʒif a kyng studieth to rule his regne by redynesse 
and by lawe as God ruleth and gouerneth al þe worlde, 
þanne þe kyng 
is most accordyng to God. 
Þanne touchyng God, 
þat Ʒeueth þe mede, 
þe kynges mede is greet Ʒif he ruleth his regne aright, 
for in þat he is moost accordyng to God. 
Þe seconde, þe kynges mede 
is grete touchinge hymself 
þat fongeth þe mede. 
For alle dedes taketh 
a maner goodnesse 
of difficulte of worchynge, 
he þat may mysdo and mysdoþ 
not beth þe bettre. 
For manye þat may not do harme kepeth hemself fro harme; 
but Ʒif he were take to state of dignite 
he wolde do moche harme. 
Þerfore, [v] Ethicorum, 
it is iwrete 
þat principate scheweth what a man is, 
for þan a man scheweth 
þat [a] schal fonge 
whan he is prince 
and may doo good and harme, 
and is þanne iknowe 
and thenketh what he is. 
Þanne in comparisoun 
þe kynge 
þat schal fonge mede is grete. 
For kynges þat bien occupide 
in þe comyn profit 
and may do iuel and doþ 
non bien worthi þe more mede. 
And we seyen þat in þe commyn profite, 
for but he be occupide 
in þe comyn profite, 
it nedeþ not þat he be worthi þe more mede 
þeiƷ a may trespace. 
For Ʒif a man putteþ 
hem to peril and takeþ 
non hede of þe comune profite, 
þeiƷ a trespace nouƷt, 
for he doþ vnwiseliche his mede 
is neuer þe more. 
Þe þridde, 
mede of princes is grete touchinge 
þe dede by | 
þe whoche he wynneth suche mede. 
For a dede is vicious Ʒif it is aƷenst kynde 
and aƷenst þe ordre of resoun; 
and is good and vertuous Ʒif it is by kynde, 
and þe more it is by ordre of resoun, 
þe bettre it is and þe more medful. 
It is ful kyndelich 
that a party potte itself 
to saue þe hole. 
For we seeth Ʒif þe heed 
is in peril 
al þe body is in peril; 
and for þe arm 
is a partie of þe bodye 
he putteth al itself 
forþ for þe heed, 
lest al þe body be ipersched. 
Þanne Ʒif kynges ruleþ 
wel þe puple 
þat is vnder hem, 
þanne by here workes þei schulle come 
to þe grete mede 
for þei putten hem hooliche forth for þe comun profitƷ 
and for þe hool profite. 
Þe ferthe, 
þe mede of kynges is greet 
by cause of þe vertue 
by the whiche þei wynnen here mede, 
for lasse vertue nedeþ 
a man to rule hymself 
than to rule many, 
and lasse to rule manye 
þan to rule a cite or a regne. 
Þanne þe vertue of þe kyng moot be greet 
þat moot rule 
not onlich hymself, 
noþer onlich his meynye, 
but also al þe regne. 
And for a gret vertue 
is worthi greet mede, 
grete is þe mede of kynges 
þat ruleth here regnes aright. 
Þe fifte, 
greete is mede of kynges touchyng þe matire 
in þe whoche þe[i] worcheþ, 
for a man is preysed 
Ʒif he ruleth aright o synguler persone, 
and þe comun profit is more goodlich 
þan eny singuler profit. 
Þanne þe matiere in þe whiche þe kyng is occupide, 
þat is God and multitude, 
demeth þat his meede is greet. Book I Part II DOI: 10.4324/9781315861739-16

After þat by help of God we hauen iended 
þe furste partie of þis firste book 
in the whiche it is itreted of mannis owne gouernaunce, 
schewynge wherinne kynges and princes schullen sette here felicite. 
For it is not semelich 
for hem to sette here ende in riches 
noþer in cyuil myƷt and strengþe, 
noþer in no suche thinges; 
but he schal vse al suche thinges, 
as it is proued tofore atte folle, 
as instrumentis and inuen[c]iones 
for to come to felicitee. 
Þei schullen sette here felicite 
in dede of prudencia, 
as þat dede cometh of charite. 
For þanne kynges hauen felicite accordyng to here astate, 
whanne by excityng of [dleleccioun of God, 
þey rulen hem 
þat bien vnder hem holilyche and rightfulliche 
by prudencia of regnynge 
and by lawe of resoun. 
Þanne þe felicite of kynges 
schal be principalliche iset in God. 
And by knowyng and loue of hym he schal ordeyne here studie 
and here lif þerto, 
þat þei mowe knowe and loue God 
and rule þe poeple 
þat is vnder ham 
as verrey Goddes seruauntes 
by ordre of resoun. 
Þanne, 
for þis is treted, 
and it is schewed where inne kynges schal sette here ende and felicite by þe ordre þat is isette, 
now it is to schewyng 
in what vertues kynges schal be excellent and vertuous 
by certeyn heyƷtyng and perfeccioun of þe soule. 
Þerfore it nedeth firste to schewe 
whiche bien þe vertual 
poten|cie and myƷtes of þe soule 
and in whiche myƷtes þe vertues bien igrounded and ipiƷt. 
And þanne it schal be ischewed 
how þe vertues bien distingued. 
Þerafter we schal declare how many suche vertues þer bien 
and whiche þerof is principale, 
and whiche is secundary, 
and þanne we schal trete singulerlich of eueriche of þese vertues 
and how it semeth kynges and princes 
to haue suche vertues. 
Þe vertual myƷtes of þe soule mowe be destyngued 
in þese wise: 
for som bien kynde and natural, 
and some cognitif and sensitif, 
and some appetitif, 
and some intellectual. 
In natural myƷtes of þe soule we communeth 
with herbes and treen, 
as in vertual myƷt of norsching, 
of wexinge, 
and of gendrynge, 
and in suche as corden to herbes and treen. 
Þe myƷtes of sensitif knowyng and felyng be þe siƷt, tast, and touche, 
and þe oþer wittes, 
and þerinne we accordeþ wiþ oþer bestes. 
Þe appetitif is destyngued, 
for oon appetit is in man 
and not in oþer bestes 
as þe appetit 
þat foloweth þe intellectual inwit. 
And anoþer maner appetit 
is in man and in beste, 
as þe appetite 
þat folweth þe felyng, 
and suche appetite 
may be cleped sensualitas. 
And þe appetit 
þat folweth þe intellectual inwit 
is icleped voluntas, 
þe wille. 
And in þat manere of speche oþer bestes 
hauenþe appetite 
þat hatte sensualitas 
and appetitus sensitiuus, 
and haueth not þe appetite 
þat hatte voluntas, 
þe intellectual wille. 
Þanne þe vertues of þe whiche we thinketh 
to speke bien goode habites, þat is dwellyng places; 
couthir thai> bien in þe natural vertual myötes, 
oþer in þe vertual myƷtes and wittes of felyng, 
oþer in þe appetite sensitif of felyng, 
oþer in | þe appetite intellectual, 
oþer in þe intellecte and inwyt, 
oþer in al þes, 
oþer in some þerof. 
And a mowe not be in natural vertual miƷttes 
and þat is declared in þre wise. [Firste,] 
for we beþ nouƷt preysed noþer iblamed 
for naturel and kynde vertue, 
for no man is acounted a good man 
for he hath good degestioun and wexinge. 
Þe seconde, 
suche vertues beþ nouƷt in þe naturel vertual myƷtes, 
for suche vertues stonden by resoun 
as it may be preued, 
ii Ethicorum, 
and natural myƷtes bien not obedient to resoun 
in þat þei bien soche. 
For þei a manmake resouns 
wheþer he wil oþer no, 
properliche for to speke 
þe natural potencial vertues varieth not in here 
kynde worchynge 
but wercheth alwey 
with al here myƷt. 
Þe þridde, habites and vertues bien not 
in natural uertual myƷtes, 
for suche habites and vertues inclineth potencial 
vertues to do wel oþer euel, 
as a vicious habite inclyneth to do euel, 
and as a vertuous habite inclineth to do wel. 
Þanne for kynde 
is inclyned and determined to oon, 
and potencial vertues bien 
fol inclyned by kynde to worche 
by here owne kynde, 
and so þerby we beþ noþer vertuous 
ne vicious 
as we speketh heere of vertueus and of vices; 
and so þerinne may not be suche vertues. 
And by þe same þre resouns 
by þe whiche it is preued 
þat vertuees bien not 
in þe natural potencial vertues, 
it may be preued þat þei bien not 
in þe knowyng 
of þe fif wittes. 
For as we ben nouƷt ipreysed noþer iblamed for natural potencial vertues, 
so we ben not ipreysed 
noþer iblamed for þe fife wittes; 
for as no man is preysed for a gode man 
for he haþ a gode digestion and wexyng, 
so man is <noƷt> presed for scharp siƷt and gode hiryng, 
but if it falleþ by hap oþer 
yf a man is 
ble|r eyƷed and his siƷt 
apeired for greet etyng and drynkyng, 
oþer Ʒif he hath euel digestioun 
or feblenesse of stomachus <for etyng, 
aliter> he schold be blamed 
<for ouer mych drinkyng, 
aliter>, 
and nouƷt for he hath yuel dygestioun, 
noþer for feble siƷt <‡> 
– for scharp sight and good digestioun [is not] 
in oure power propurliche for to speke – 
but he schulde be blamed fore 
he hath itake 
to muche of mete and of drynke, 
for it was in his powere 
to ete and drynke mesurableliche. 
Þe secunde, moral vertue is not 
in þe potencial vertue of þe fyue wyttes, 
for as þe kynde potencial vertues 
beþ noƷt obedient to reson, 
for by reule of resoun 
no man haþ more digestioun 
oþer lasse, 
noþer more growyng oþer lasse: 
so þe fif wittes bien not obedient to resoun, 
for it is not in manis power to se oþer heitlerlich oþer dymlich; 
and Ʒif moral vertue folweth resoun, 
þanne vertue is not in fife wittes. 
Þe þridde, 
moral vertue is not 
in þe fif wittes; 
for as þe natural potencial vertues beþ fol set to here 
worchyng 
by here owne kynde, 
so bien þe wittes also. 
For as þe fuyre heteth wiþ al his myƷt, 
for it worcheth 
by his owne kynde 
and is þerfore noþer preysed noþer iblamed, 
noþer þerinne is moral vertue: 
so for þe potencial vertue of digestioun makeþ 
as gret digestioun as he may, 
and þe eyƷe seeth 
as moche as he may, þerinne may no moral vertue be iset. 
For by <natural> vertue, potencial vertue is iset awork 
atte folle by here owen kynde and nedeþ 
þerfore no moral vertue. 
And so moral vertue 
is not in natural potencial vertue, 
noþer in potencial vertues of þe fife wittes; 
and oþer potencial vertues ben þere nouƷt 
bute the intellectualle <vertu> 
þat is þe vnderstondyng 
and þe appetite sensytyue and intellectiue. 
Þanne | in soche potencial vertues 
mot be moral vertues. Chapter II 
For it is schewed 
þat moral vertues ben nouƷt in naturel potencial vertues of felyng, 
now it is to schewyng hou vertues bien distyngwed 
and how þei bien 
in þe intellectual inwit 
and in þe appetit. 
Þanne it is to distynguyng of vertues 
and of suche potencial vertues. 
For som vertues ben intellectual, 
and som moral, 
and somme mene bytwene intellectual and moral. 
Þe intellectual vertues bien in þe inwit 
þat hatte intellectus speculatiuus, 
þat is þe schewyng of þe inwit, 
and soche vertues bien speculatif sciens, 
as natural philosophi, gemetrie, and methaphisik, 
and oþer suche. 
And pure moral vertues bien 
in þe appetite sensitif oþer intellectif. 
And soche vertues bien iusticia, temporancia, fortitudo, mansuetudo and oþer soche, 
of þe whiche we schal trete syngulerlich. 
Þe mene vertues 
bytwene intellectual and moral beþ 
in þe inwyt, 
þat hatte intellectus practicus, 
as prudencia and oþere vertues 
þat longeþ þerto. 
Þe comentor super libris Ethicorum seith 
þat prudencia 
is acounted a mene vertue 
bytwene moral vertues 
and intellectual vertues 
and may natheles be accounted 
with [mor]al vertues. 
But prudencia is not but in goode men 
as morel vertues 
beth not bote in gode men. 
Schrewed men, 
þeiƷ þei mowe be kunnynge, 
falce and gylefole, 
þei mowe not be prudentes, 
as it schal be declared in þe place þerof. 
Þerfore, [vi] Ethicorum, 
it is iseid 
þat it is inpossible 
to be prudens and not good. 
Þanne we leueþ þe vertues intellectual and sciens speculatif and schal trete of prudencia and of moral vertues. 
For as we hauen ofte seyd, 
we taken þis werk not for to be kunnynge | 
bote for to be good, 
for goodnesse may not be 
in vs withoute prudencia and moral vertues. 
Þes vertues may be in þe inwit, 
þat hatte intellectus, 
þat is to say vnderstondyng, 
and in þe appetite also. 
And it is seid 
þat a vertue is som what after resoun. 
Þanne þe vertue moot be in þe resonable vertue and potencial myƷt. 
And þe philosofer setteth double resonable, 
oon by his owne essencia, 
and an oþer by þat he is partener of resoun. 
Þe vnderstondyng 
and þe inwit 
þat hatte intellectus 
is resonable 
by his owne essencia and by itself. 
And þe appetit is resonable 
by þat he is partiner of resoun. 
For þeiƷ þe appetit 
is not intellectus 
and þe silf resoun, 
Ʒit he is aconted partiner of resoun, 
for he may be obedient to resoun. 
Þe natural potencial vertues 
and þe fif wittes of felyng ben not resonable of hemself, 
nor þei bien not þe silue resoun resoun <and> 
[þei bien not parteners of resoun 
nor sogette to resoun] 
in so moche as þei bien potencial vertues. 
Þanne in þe fif wittes 
and in þe natural potencial vertues bien not moral vertues, 
as it is iseide tofore honde; 
but þei bien oonlich 
in þe inwit and vnderstondyng, 
þat hatte intellectus, 
and in þe appetite. 
And in vs is double knowyng, 
intellectif and sensitif. 
For as kynde appetite 
folweth kyndelich 
þe forme 
þat a hath by kynde, 
so þe appetit of knowyng 
folweth þe forme þat apprehendeþ and conceyueth by knowyng. 
For as heuy thinges, 
for þei hauen þe fourme of heuynesse, 
þei hauen also a certeyne kynde inclynacioun and kynde appetit to desire 
to be bynethe and lowe, 
so þei þat hauen knowyng, 
in þat [þei] hauen in hemself 
þe fourme þat is conceyued, 
þei hauen also som inclinacioun 
and some appetit 
as þat fourme moueþ. 
Þerfore as we hauen double knowyng, 
| sencitif and intellectif, 
so we hauen doble appetit; 
sencitif þat folweþ 
þe fourme 
þat is conceyued 
by þe wit of felyng, 
and intellectif þat is 
þe forme þat is conceyued by þe vnderstondyng, 
þat hatte intellectus. 
And þe appetit sencitif is double. 
For bestes bien aboue soules þynges and kynde Ʒeueth double potencial vertue 
to elementis and to soules þynges, 
oon by þe whiche þei desiren here owne reste and anoþer 
by þe whiche þei withstonden þynges 
þat letteþ and bien contrary, 
moche more kynde iƷeueþ 
to bestes double potencial vertue, 
for þei bien more parfit þanne soules þynges. 
We seeþ þat fuyre is hoot 
and liƷt by kynde, 
and by liƷtnesse desireth his owne place 
and quyete acordyng þerto, 
and worcheþ by hete 
and withstondeþ thynges þat bien contrarie þerto. 
Þanne for fuyre schulde not be ilet 
by contrarie þyngys to reste 
by liƷtnesse in his owne place, 
kynde Ʒeueth þerto potencial vertue to hete 
þat it may 
þerby worche 
and withstonde þinges 
þat ben contrarie and corumpeþ fyre. 
Þan Ʒif kynde Ʒeueth to fyre 
and to soules þynges double potencial vertue, 
oon by þe whiche he geteth here owne quiete and reste, 
and anoþer by þe whiche he worcheþ 
and withstondeþ 
lettes and contrarie þynges, 
moche more kynde iƷeueþ to bestes suche potencial vertues. 
Þanne kynde Ʒeueþ to hem double appetit, 
sencitif appetite of felyng, 
oon by þe whiche a purseweþ 
and cometh to here owne quiete and likynge, 
and þis potencial vertue concupiscibilis he hiƷte, 
þat is coueitisnesse; 
and anoþer by þe whiche he withstondeþ 
and resfeþ contrarie and lettes, 
and þat hatte irascibilis, 
as it were potencial wreþ. 
So þat þe concupiscible is as it were in stede of liƷtnesse 
and heuynesse 
in ÜƷt þynges and heuy. 
Þe irascibilis is as it were in stede of cold 
and of hete in colde | þynges and hote. 
For as heuye þynges by heuynesse 
forsakeþ þe ouer place 
as not accordynge and cometh 
to þe nether place as conuenient and accordyng, 
and wiþstondeþ 
by cold þynges 
þat bien contrarie and letteþ 
and saueþ hemself 
þat þey bien not corrupt in here kynde, 
noþer ilet of here owne place and quiete; 
so by þe concupiscibilis, 
bestes voyden and forsaken yuel þynges and displesynge, 
and folweþ and takeþ goode þynges and likynge. 
And by irascibilis a reseth and putteþ 
of and wiþstandeþ 
þe contrarie 
þat myƷt hem lette of suche likynge 
oþer of pl[esan]ce. 
By þe concupiscibilis he gooþ 
and comeþ and takeþ mete 
as þyng þat is conuenient and accordyng and likynge. 
And by þe irascibilis a reseþ and withstondeþ 
oþer þat letteþ hem of here mete. 30 35 40 
Þerfore it is wel seid 
þat þe concupiscibilis takeþ hede to good 
and to iuel 
[for þei bien soche, 
and þe irascibilis takeþ hede to good and to iuel] 
in so moche as þei bien hard to voide 
oþere to come to. 
For good is desired 
for it is good, 
and yuel is schoned 
and forsake 
<for it is euyl>. 
Þe concupiscibilis is inclined and desireth reste 
and þyng þat is good and likynge, 
and schoneþ and forsakeþ euel þynges and vnlikyng, 
and hath for obiecte sensible goode and euel for þei bien soche 
(þat is to menyng al þat is desired or schoned and forsake is good 
oþer euel, 
sensible in þat þat þei bien sensible). 
By þe irascible we reseth and withstondeþ 
in þat wyse þynges 
þat greueþ vs and letteþ. 
And þe irascibiles, 
þat is wretheful doyng, 
longeþ to good and yuel, 
not onlich for þey bien suche, 
bote for þei bien gete or kept oþer withstonde 
with [h]a[rd] diffecultee. 
For hard difficultee letteþ vs principalliche 
to gete good and voyde yuel and harme. 
Þanne kynde rulede vnparfitliche 
Ʒif he Ʒaf to bestes þe concupiscibel to desire good 
and to schone and forsake yuel, 
but Ʒif he Ʒaf to hem also | 
þe irascibel by þe whiche a reseth and defendeþ and wiþstondeþ greues and lettes 
þat letteþ hem of delectacion and likyng. 
Þanne for bestes scholde haue ful lykynge 
by þe concupiscible in manere 
þat is accordyng to hem, 
þe irascibel is iƷeue to hem 
by þe whiche a reseth and wiþstondeþ 
þynges þat greueth and letteþ hem of delectacioun and likyng. 
Þanne þe appetite sencitif of felyng is double, 
irascible and concupiscible. 
And þe appetit intellectif 
þat is icleped voluntas, 
þe wille, abideþ 
and is on and nouƷt deuyded. 
For þe inwit þat hatte intellectus 
conceiueþ his obiecte more generallich 
þan þe wit of felyng 
þat hiƷte sensus. 
Þe appetit intellectif 
þat folweth þe inwit 
þat hiƷte intellectus 
is more generalliche inclined to goode þynges 
þan is þe appetite 
þat folweþ 
þe wit of felyng. 
For þe more generallich a thing is take and conceyued, 
to mo þynges þe same þyng stryccheþ. 
ÞeiƷ þe appetit sencitif 
by þe 
whiche we beþ inclyned and desireþ 
sencible þynges 
þat bien likyng be oþer 
þan þe appetit sencitif 
by þe whiche we reseþ and wiþstondeþ greues and lettes, 
nathelesþe appetiteintellectifis aloon and streccheth to al good 
þat is intelligible and likynge. 
Þanne al by oon appetite intellectif 
we desiren intelligible þynges and likynge 
and auentreth 
on thynges of difficultee, 
and þat appetite is not diuers 
as þe appetite sencitif is diuers, 
by þe whiche we desireþ sencible þynges and likynge 
and wiþstondeþ greues and lettes. 
And so Ʒif eueriche vertue moral 
is in þe inwit þat hatte intellectus, 
oþer in þe appetite, 
and som appetite is intellectif, 
oþer þe wille, 
and som is sencitif, 
and þis is double, 
irascible and concupiscible, 
þanne eueriche vertue moral mot bee | 
in þe inwit 
þat is intellectus, 
oþer in þe wil, 
oþer in þe irascible, 
oþer in þe concupiscible. ‡ Þanne for to speke largeliche of moral vertue, 
as redinesse, hatte prudencia, 
is acounted vertue moral, 
we may saye þat by þese foure potencial vertues of þe soule 
in þe whiche beþ moral vertues, 
foure vertues bien itake 
þat bien icleped cardinal vertues: 
þat bien prudencia, iusticia, fortitudo and temporancia – redinesse, riƷtwisnesse, stalwordnesse and temporance. 
For prudencia is in þe intellecte, iusticia in þe wille, fortitudo in þe irascible and temporancia in þe concupiscible. Chapter III Circa finem, ii Ethicorum, 
al withoute prudencia and iusticia, 
þe philosofer rekeneth ten vertues moral 
þat bien icleped [fortitudo], temporancia, honoris amatiua, magnanimitas, largitas, magnificencia, mansuetudo, veritas, affabilitas, eutrapelia 
(þat may we clepe bene vertibilitas oþer societas). 
Þanne for to acounte iusticia and prudencia, 
moral vertues bien twelfe, 
of alle þe whiche we schal trete arewe 
and ho[w] it semeth kynges to haue þese vertues 
and what partyes 
þey hauen and vertues 
þat longeþ þerto. 
Þe nombre of þese vertues 
may be itake in þis wise. 
For þe subiecte of a vertue is intellectus 
oþer voluntas, þe wille, oþer þe appetite sencitif, 
euerich vertue moral 
is in þe inwit 
þat hatte intellectus as prudencia, 
oþer in voluntate, 
þe wille, as iusticia, 
oþer in þe appetite sencitif, 
as þe ten vertues morale 
þat we haueþ irekened, 
of þe whiche þe philosofer speketh, ii Ethicorum. 
Þes vertues mowe be itake 
in anoþer manere in þis wise, 
for vertues bien | men[e] and bien not but in þynges 
þat bieþ in oure powere 
in þe whiche it is semelich 
þat we sette mene, 
euenes and †vnneuenes†, 
and suche bien þre: resons, passions and outward worchyng. 
By vertues we schal haue riƷtful resouns and moderate passiouns 
and outward workys, 
skylful and moderate and mesurable. 
In þat ‡ we haueþ riƷtfoul resouns prudencia is itake, 
in þat we hauen in þe otter workes mesurable 
in equyte iusticia is itake, 
and in þat we hauen moderate passiouns, 
þe ten vertues moral bien itake 
of þe whiche we made mencioun 
in þe bygynnyng of þis chapitre. 
Þanne iusticia 
is in wille 
and is diuers and oþer þan þe ten vertues þat bien in þe appetit sencitif. 
For eiþer moderateth owtward workes and passiouns 
þat bieþ in þe appetit sencitif, 
but þat he doþ diuersliche. 
For þe ten vertues moderateþ principaliche þe passions 
([þat] ben moderate in þe appetites) 
and he moderateth outward workes and dedes by moderate passiouns. 
For Ʒif þe innere passiouns bien moderate, 
we fondeþ to do moderateliche outward workes and dedes. 
But iusticia doþ aƷeward riƷtteth 
and moderateth 
frist outward þynges and workes and dedes and doþ 
þat euerich man haue his owne 
and what is thewe 
þat he haue. 
And Ʒif iusticia moderateþ and tempereþ meuynges and passiouns 
þat ben in þe appetite, 
þat is to schewyng þertofore Ʒif þe ottere thinges, workes and dedes, 
ben moderat and areuled ariƷt, 
þanne in vs passions 
ben moderat and rewled ariƷt. 
In þe iii manere þis diuision 
may be take in þis wise, 
for eueriche vertue moral tendeþ 
and inclineth to good of resoun; 
and tende and incline to good of resoun 
may be in þre manere wise: 
oþer makynge good parfite, 
oþer makyng suche good, 
| oþer kepynge oþer sauynge suche good. 
And prudencia tendeþ 
and inclineþ to good of resoun, 
for it þe silfe resoun parfiteþ. 
For prudencia is in þe intellecte 
as perfeccioun 
is in þe þyng þat is maad parfiƷt. 
And iusticia tendeþ 
and inclyneþ to good, 
for it makeþ suche good. 
For in ottere þynges, workes and dedes, 
iusticia makeþ and doþ 
þat good and riƷt þat resoun 
demeþ and axeþ. 
And þe vertues morale tendeþ 
and inclineþ to good of resoun 
as it is comynliche iseyde, 
for he kepeth it and saueþ. 
For suche vertues moderateþ, 
chasteþ and tempereth passiouns and makeþ 
þat man be not mysladde by passiouns, 
noþer be ibrouƷt out of resoun, 
noþer out of þe good of resoun. 
Þerfore it is iseide 
þat he kepeþ and saueth suche goode. 
Þanne seiƷe we þat a moral vertue makeþ resoun riƷtful 
and is in resoun, 
and makeþ resoun parfitƷ, 
and is prudencia; 
other it is in voluntate, 
þe wille, 
and makeþ þe outward workes and dedes riƷtful 
and is cause of goode workes and dedes, 
and so iusticia; 
other it is in þe appetit sencitif and moderateþ 
and tempreth passions 
and kepeth and saueth 
þe good of resoun, 
and beþ itake in þe ten moral vertues 
þat beþ yrekened tofore honde. 
Þe nombre þerof 
and þe sufficiencia 
may be itake in þis wise. 
It is seid tofore honde 
þat þilke vertues bien aboute passions þe whiche a moderateþ principallich and chasteþ and tempereth. 
Andof diuers obiectis cometh diuers passiouns; 
þanne diuers vertues may be itake, 
as diuers menes in þulke passions 
bien ifounde by order of resoun. 
Þanne by leue to passe liƷtliche 
and by leknesse say we 
þat passiouns 
comeþ of good oþer of yuel. 
Ʒif he cometh of yuel, 
þanne he comeþ of yuel 
þat is to comyng oþer of yuel 
þat is present. 
And if of euel 
þat is to come, 
we haueþ passions, 
drede and hardinesse; 
drede whan we 
we[r]neþ – <refusen> – such euel, 
and hardi|nesse whanne we auentureth and reseth þeron. 
And betwene þese twey passions 
is oon mene 
and myddel vertue 
and hatte fortitudo. 
Þanne is fortitudo mene bytwene þe drede and hardynesse 
and is in þe irascible; 
for drede and hardinesse ben in þe irascible. 
<And þer spekeþ of hardinesse 
þat is folehardines; 
but of wis hardines 
and rediliche ireuled 
and is icleped fortitudo…> 
And Ʒif suche passions comeþ 
of yuel oþer harme 
þat is ido to vs, 
Ʒif we fondeþ to be awreke 
of þe harme 
and despit þat is ido, 
þanne it is ira, 
wrethe, 
þat desireth wreche, 
and Ʒif we failleth and fondeþ not to take wreche þanne it is mititas. 
Betwene þes tweye is þe vertue 
þat hatte mansuetudo. 
But mansuetudo is not properliche þe vertue 
þat is bitwene þe twey passiouns 
þat bien icleped mititas and ira, 
but it is more verreyliche þe passioun 
þat hatte mititas. 
Nathales as it is seide, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
for we haueþ no proper name for þat vertue, 
it hath þe name of þe passioun 
þat failleþ of hardynesse 
and is icleped mansuetudo. 
And mansuetudo 
is in þe irascible, 
for þerinne is mititas and ira, 
as it were myldenesse and wreþþe, 
bytwene þe whiche þat vertue is mene. 
Þanne tweye vertues 
þat bieþ 
in þe irascible 
ben bitwene þe passions 
þat comeþ of yuel and harme, 
as fortitudo is bitwene passions 
þat cometh of yuel and harme 
þat is to comynge, 
and mansuetudo is betwene passiouns 
þat cometh of euel 
oþer harme 
þat is present. 
And Ʒif vertues bien itake 
bytwene passions 
þat cometh of goode, 
þanne we schal make a distinccioun of good. 
For som good is mannes good in hymself, 
and som good is his good 
in ordere to oþer men; 
and manis good in hymself is treble, 
for som good is delectable and likynge, 
as mete | and drynke and oþere suche. 
And som is profitable, 
as mynt and money, 
and som is honestas, honour and worschep, 
and þis noune honestum cometh of honor, 
for honestum is as it were þe staat of honor. 
Among passions þat cometh of good 
þat is delectable 
and likyng cometh 
but on vertue: 
þat is temporancia 
and [is] in concupiscible. 
Among þe passions of profitable good bien twey vertues, 
for [oþer] soche good is mene 
[and] is so liberalitas 
(o[r] fredom of herte, 
in mene spendynge and cost), 
oþer suche good is passynge howge and with difficulte, 
and is so magnificencia (fredom of herte in passyng spendyng and cost 
þat bien grete and with difficulte): 
[for] magnificencia is grete doynge. 
Þanne liberalitas is in þe concupiscible 
and magnificencia 
is in þe irascible, 
for magnificencia is passyng 
and with difficulte. 
And Ʒif þe good is honeste 
oþer honor and worschep, 
þanne þat honor is mene 
and is þanne comynliche icleped 
honoris amatiua and honoris amor, 
loue of worschep. 
And Ʒif þat honor is greet, 
þanne it is magnanimitas, 
þat stondeþ in passyng gret werschep and honor. 
And honoris amatiua is in concupiscible and magnanimitas in þe irascible. 
And so som delectable good and likynge may nouƷt haue þe resoun of difficulte 
as profitable good and honest. 
Þei boþe of profitable good and honest be 
twey vertues itake, 
of þe whiche þe oon is [in] 
þe concupiscibel 
and þe oþer 
in þe irascible, 
of delectable good and likynge 
is but oon vertue itake, 
þat is in þe concupiscible, 
as temporancia. 
And Ʒif þe vertues bien among passions 
þat comeþ of good 
in þe whiche we comuneth with oþere, 
as it is iseide, 
ii Ethicorum, 
so bien þre vertues itake. 
For we comuneth with oþere men in wordes and in dedes. 
| As we comuneth with oþer, 
wordes serueþ vs to soþnesse and verrite, 
to lif and to pleye. 
Þanne is treble vertue, veritas, affabilitas and eutrapilia 
þat may be icleped bona v<er>sio. 
As we speken here of veritas, 
veritas is vertue not speculatif, 
but as a man is not an ypocrite 
noþer a bostere 
but he is acordynge 
in wordes and in dedes and scheweth 
in whiche he is withowte gyle 
in wordes and in dedes. 
But affabilitas is whan a man is good of conuersacioun of lif, 
and is not contrarious noþer froward ne fatour, bote good to speke with and courteys. 
And e[u]trapolia, 
þat is also icleped bona versio, 
is whan a man can haue hymself 
wel in pley and in murþe 
so þat he be not a mynstralle, 
iaper, ne scomer, 
so þat he make iapes 
ne scorne of alle þynges, 
noþer a froward boynard 
þat noþer play noþer murþe of no þyng, 
for þanne he is icleped agristis; 
but þat he haue hymself 
as a scholde in murþe 
and in playe 
and is þanne icleped outrapelius 
and bene se vertens. 
Alle þes þre vertues, 
for he stondeþ 
not in passynge hard difficulte, þei bien in þe concupiscible. 
And so for foure potencial vertues of þe soule fongeþ vertues of þe whiche we spekeþ 
at þis tyme, 
suche vertues bien twelue. 
For oon is in þe inwit 
þat hatte intellectus, 
and oon in voluntate, 
þe wille, 
and þe foure in þe irascible, 
and sexe in þe concupiscible. 
In þe intellectus is prudencia. 
In voluntate, 
in þe [w]ille, is iusticia. 
In þe irascible is fortitudo, mansuetudo, magnanimitas and magnificencia, 
þat bien itake in þis wise: fortitudo and mansuetudo longeþ to passions 
þat cometh of yuel 
as fortitudo longeth to passionis 
þat cometh of iuel þat is to comyng, 
and mansuetudo | to passionis 
þat cometh of euel þat is present oþer ipassed. 
And magnificencia and magnanimitas stondeth 
in passyng good of difficulte and þat diuersliche, 
for magnificencia stondeþ 
in good þat is profitable, 
as in greet spence and cost. 
And magnanimitas stondeþ 
in passyng good 
þat is honest, 
as in greet worschep and honour. 
In þe concupiscible bien sex vertues: temporancia, liberalitas, honoris amatiua, veritas, affabilitas and eutrapelia; 
and bien itake in þis wise: 
þre þerof, 
as temporancia, liberalitas 
and honoris amatiua stondeþ 
in mannys good in hymself and þe oþere þre stondeþ in mannys good in ordre to oþere. 
Þanne in eiþer maner good 
stondeþ þre vertues, 
for man hath þre maner good in hymsilf. 
For som is delectable and likynge, 
and þerinne stondeþ temporancia; 
and som is profitable, 
and þerinne stondeþ liberalitas; 
and som is honeste, 
and þerinne stondeþ honoris amatiua. 
Also in ordre to oþere 
is þre manere of good; 
somme serueþ vs to schewyng 
and so is veritas, 
and somme to lyf 
and so is affabilitas, 
and somme to pleye oþer pleynge 
and so is eutrapelia. 
And so it is declared hou many soche vertues þer beþ 
and how þei bien destyngwed. Chapter IV 
We haueþ destyngwed 
in þe nexte chapitre twelfe vertues, 
of þe whiche oon is in þe inwit 
þat hatte intellectus, 
as prudencia; 
oon in voluntate, 
þe wille, as iusticia; 
foure in þe irascible, 
as fortitudo, mansuetudo, magnanimitas and magnificencia; 
sex in þe concupiscible, 
as temporancia and oþere þe whiche we hauen rekened byfore hond. 
Þanne lest som man wolde wene 
þat þer bien none 
oþere goode disposiciouns 
þan þes vertues 
þat bien irekened, 
we bien avised 
for to declare þat 
(þer to speke of good disposicions of þe whiche philosofres | spekeþ, 
for of oþer 
at þis tyme 
it is not oure entent to make tretees) 
somme <ere> vertues, 
somme serueth to vertues, 
some desposen to vertues 
and some bien aboue vertues. 
Largelich to speke of vertues, 
alle suche goode disposiciouns 
may be cleped vertues. 
Natheles some gode disposiciouns serueth to vertues, 
a[s] good counsaille 
and good doom of þe þynges 
þat counsaille 
is itake of serueth 
to þe vertue 
þat hatte prudencia. 
Þanne he þat is wel desposed 
þerto is desposed 
and able to be prudens, 
wis and redy. 
And so good disposiciouns bien not ful vertues 
but þei disposen to vertues, 
as perseuerancia and continencia 
þat bien not ful vertues, 
as þe philosofer spekeþ here of hem, 
but he desposeth to vertue; 
for he is icleped perseuerans 
þat falleþ not 
þey he be not tempted, 
and so fareþ som tyme men 
þat bien not vertuous, 
[for þei ben not 
passionate,] noþer falleþ. 
And he is continens 
þat is passionat 
and hath strong passions 
and folweth resons and not passioun. 
Þanne he þat is continens 
is not vertuous atte folle, 
for þei þat he do wel 
by cause of goode passions, 
natheles he ne hath no likyng in þat good doynge. 
Þanne continencia and perseuerancia itake in þes wyse 
is not þe vertue þey þat it be good disposicioun to vertue. 
Also som good disposicions 
bien aboue vertue 
as þe vertue 
þat hiƷte vertus diuina 
and vertus heroyca and super iusta, 
of þe whiche it is itreted, 
vii Ethicorum. 
For as som men bien 
as it were bestes 
and euyl passyng þe manere of men, 
so som men bien as it were goddyche 
and good passyng þe maner of mankynde. 
Þerfore suche men 
may be cleped super vertuosi, 
passyng vertuouse. 
And suche goddische vertue þat is som del aboue vertuous 
schal namliche bien in kynges and in princes 
þat schulde be 
as it were half goddysch 
as | it is seyde. 
Þe ferþe, 
som good desposicions bien þe selue vertues, 
as iusticia, prudencia, 
and oþere þe whiche we made mencioun in þe nexte chapitre. 
Þanne of alle þes foure we schul speke 
in here awne place. 
For we schul determe of vertues 
and declare how it is semelich 
þat kynges and princes hauen vertues, 
and we schullen also determe of helpes and disposiciouns 
to vertue 
and of þilke 
þat bien aboue vertue, 
declarynge how hym nedede þat kynges and princes bien iheiƷte 
with suche helpes disposicions and vertues. 
B[ut] first we schul speke 
of þe selue vertues. Chapter V 
Tofore we haueþ irekened twelf vertues, 
but þei twelf bien not ileche 
alle parfite noþer ileche principallich. 
Holy seyntes and philosofres vsed 
to make disty[n]cciouns of vertues, 
for som bien principale and cardinale and som annexed. 
And þe cardinale vertues bien foure: iusticia, prudencia, fortitudo, and temporancia; 
and þe vertues annexed 
and not principal bien þe oþere eiƷte, 
of þe whiche we made mencioun tofore. 
Þat þese foure vertues bien cardinal 
and principale we may declare by þre weyes. 
Þe first wey is itake 
by þe mater 
in þe whiche þes vertues stondeþ; 
þe secunde, 
by þe subiecte 
in þe whiche þey bien inne; 
þe þrydde, 
by þe condiciouns 
þat bien required 
and nedeful to vertues. 
Þe firste is declared in þis wise, 
for eueriche vertue stondeþ 
oþer in resouns or in passiouns, 
oþer in workes, 
oþer in dedes. 
For it happeþ to make resouns riƷtfulliche and vnriƷtfullyche, 
it nedeþ to Ʒeue som vertue 
þat is riƷtful resoun 
by þe whiche we may make riƷtful resouns of werkes and dedes. 
Also for it happeþ to worche riƷtfullich and vnriƷtfullych, 
as þer is a vertue iƷeue 
by þe whiche al ben irouled in makyng resones 
of | workes and dedes, 
so þer is a vertue by þe whyche we bien irulede in workes and dedes. 
Also for it happeþ vs to be pascionate riƷtfulliche and vnryƷtfullyche, 
it nedeþ to Ʒeue vertues 
by þe whiche we may be modefiede 
in þe same passiouns. 
Þanne for som passiouns exciteth vs to iuel, 
as þe passiouns 
þat bien concupiscibele and likyng, 
for we bieth inclyned and sone assentynge to suche passyons, 
and some passions wiþdraweþ vs from good 
as þe passions irascible, wrethful, 
it nedeþ to Ʒeue 
som vertues lest passions incline vs to þynges 
þat is aƷenst resoun. 
And also it nedeþ to Ʒeue anoþer vertue lest passions 
wiþdrawe vs fram þynges 
þat resoun axeth. 
For eueriche vertue rectifieþ 
and makeþ resons riƷtful, 
oþer eueneþ dedes and workes, 
oþer modefieþ and chasteþ passiouns 
þat þey brynge vs not to do aƷenst resoun, 
oþer modefyeþ þe passions 
þat he withdraweþ vs not fro þyng þat resoun axeþ. 
And for prudencia principalliche makeþ riƷtfol resouns; 
iusticia principalliche equite and riƷtfulnesse in workes and dedes; 
temporancia principalliche modefieth and chasteþ passions 
þat þey brynge vs not to doun aƷenst resoun; 
fortitudo principallich modifieth and chasteth passions 
þat þei wiþdrawe vs not fro þynges 
þat resoun axeth; 
and so by cause of þe mater 
in þe whiche soche vertues stondeþ 
þes foure vertues bien cleped principale and cardinale, 
for þei stonden in þe matier 
in þe whiche principal occupacioun is of mankynde. 
Þe seconde wey to declare 
þat þes vertues bien cardynale 
and principale may be itake 
by þe subiecte 
in þe whiche þei bien | inne. 
For it is seid tofore 
þat þe vertues 
þat we spekeþ of at þis tyme bien in potencial vertues of þe soule: 
in intellectu, in voluntate, in irascibili 
and in concupiscibili. 
Þanne for þe intelle[c]te 
þat hatte intellectus practicus, 
þe principal vertue is prundencia; 
in voluntate, þe wille 
(for to speke of vertues 
þat cometh of goode dedes), 
þe principal vertue is iusticia; 
and in þe irascible, 
þe principal vertue is fortitudo; 
and in þe concupiscible 
þe principal vertue is temporancia. 
Þerfore þese foure vertues, prudencia, iusticia, 
and temporancia and fortitudo, 
bien icleped vertues cardinales and principales. 
Þe þridde wey is itake by þe condiciouns 
þat bien required and nedful to eueriche vertue; 
for eueriche acte and dede, 
Ʒif it schal be vertuous, 
mot be doun with prudencia, fortitudo, iusticia and temporancia. 
Þerfore þes foure vertues bien principalliche icleped cardinales and principales. 
And in oþer moral vertues 
may be som principalite 
as magnanimitas 
hath som principalte 
ouer oþer vertues. 
For as þe philosofer seide, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
magnanimitas semeth 
a maner omament and heighnesse 
of alle oþere vertues. 
Also magnificencia hath som principalte 
for greet cost and spenses 
in þe whiche it stondeþ. 
And oþere vertues hauen som principalte, 
bote þes foure bien principalliche icleped principales and cardinales; 
but how þat is in þe processe 
þat schal be made of eueriche of hem 
it schal be declared at þe folle. 
Þanne for þes foure bien cardinales 
and more principal þan oþere, 
first it is to spekyng of þe foure. 
Also for prudencia 
is more principal 
þan al þe oþer, 
for it rewleþ al þe oþere; 
and iusticia is more principal 
þan fortitudo and temporancia, 
for iusticia stondeþ 
in byeng and sellyng 
and changyng of þynges 
in distribucioun of Ʒiftes and catel 
and of good 
in þe whiche oure lif is occupide; and | for fortitudo 
is more principal þanne temporancia, 
for fortitudo is more ordeined 
to þe comyn profit þan is temporancia; 
þerfore þis schal be þe ordre. 
For first we schulle telle what is prudencia, 
and þat [it] is semeliche 
þat kynges and princes haue prudencia. 
[Þe secunde, 
we schulle determe of þe vertue of iusticia, 
and schewe þat it is semeliche 
þat kynges 
and princes haue iusticia] 
and be riƷtful. 
Þanne we schulle determe of þe vertues 
þat hatte fortitudo and temporancia, 
and declare þat it is semeliche 
þat kynges 
and princes haue þe vertues 
þat hatte fortitudo and temporancia. 
Þanne we schulle determe of þe vertues 
þat hatte magnanimitas and magnificencia, 
and of oþer vertues, 
declarynge how it is semelich 
þat kynges and princes be parfite in suche vertues. Chapter VI Prudencia, 
of þe whiche we thenken firste trete, 
it may be ilikned to diuers thinges; 
and as it is ilikned to diuerce þynges, 
it is diuersliche discreued. 
And as it longeth to þis doynge, 
we may likne prundencia 
to vertues morale, 
þe whiche he gouemeth and ruleth; 
to vertues intellectuale, 
to þe whiche he commandeth and hoteþ; 
to þe matier in þe whiche he is occupied; 
to science and to craft 
fro þe whiche he is destyngwed. 
Prudencia ruleth vertues moral for vertues moral 
inclineþ to ende 
þat is accordyng þerto, 
as temporancia inclineth to sobernesse 
and to hate seruice of Venus, 
and we may not incline to accordyng ende of temporancia 
noþer to þe ende of oþere vertues morale 
but we wete and knowe 
in what wise we may come to suche an ende by prudencia. 
Þanne by moral vertues we ordeyneth 
to vs accordynge and þewe endes; 
but by prudencia we bien ireuled 
and comen to þilke endes. 
And prudencia takeþ endes of vertues moral and by thinges 
þat bien iordeyned to þe ende prudencia ruleþ and ledeþ 
to þylke endes. 
Þerfore as pmdencia | 
is ilykned to vertues moral, 
pmdencia may be affined 
and descreued in þis wise: 
prudencia is perfeccioun of þe inwitte 
þat hatte intellectus, 
oþer good qualite of þe saule and þouƷt, 
rulyng and ledyng to þe ende of vertues morale. 
Þe secounde, 
pmdencia may be likned to vertues intellectuale, 
þe whiche he hoteþ and commandeþ. 
As it longeth to þis doyng, 
Ʒif we wolleþ do redyliche and welle in workes and dedes, þre thinges bien nedful to vs. Firste, 
we schul fynde diuers weyes; 
þe secounde, 
we schal deme of þe weyes 
þat bien ifounde; 
þe þridde, 
we schul hote and commaunde 
þat workes and dedes be ido in þe weyes 
þat bien ifunde and idemed. 
As Ʒif we wolde take a castel 
by workes and dedes of armes, 
firste we schul fynde weyes and caste 
by eche maneres of doyng wherby 
þe castel may be itake. 
Þe seconde, 
we schul deme Ʒif þe weyes 
þat bien ifounde bien [good] 
to come þerby to þe purpos. 
Þe þridde, 
we schul hote and commande to worche 
and to do in þe weyes of maners 
þat bien ifounde and idemed. 
Þanne in oure intellect 
and vnderstondynge schal be þre vertues: 
oon by þe whiche we may wel fynde and take good counceille 
and þes vertues 
þe philosofer clepeth euburia, 
þat is to menyng good counceillyng, 
vi Ethicorum. 
And another vertue by þe whiche we may wel deme of weyes and maneres 
þat bien ifounde 
and þe philosofer clepeth þis vertue synesys, 
þat is þe vertue of good demyng. 
Þe þridde vertue 
by þe whiche we may hote 
and commaunde to wirche and to do in þe weyes of maneres 
þat bien ifounde and idemed, 
and þis vertue we clepeþ prudencia. 
Þanne in comparisoun to þe vertue of fyndyng 
and to þe vertue of demyng, 
prudencia is icleped 
a vertue of hotyng and comman|dyng, 
for what þe oþer twey vertues 
fyndeþ and demeþ, 
prudencia hoteþ and commandeþ 
þat it be do oþer ileft. 
Þanne prudencia ruleth and ledeþ to workes and dedes more 
þan doþ 
þe vertue of fyndyng or of demyng, 
for prudencia hoteþ and commandeþ 
to doun soche workes and dedes. 
Þanne for in moral matier workes and dedes bien acounted best, prudencia þat is nere to workes and dedes is better vertue 
þan þe vertue of fyndyng or of demyng. 
Þanne in comparison to þe vertues of fyndyng and demyng 
þat ben vertues intellectual, 
prudencia may be discreued in þis wise: 
prudencia is a vertue of hotyng and comaundyng of þyng 
þat is ifonde and idemid. 
Þanne so, vi Ethicorum, 
it is iseide 
þat as euburia fyndeþ 
and synesys demeþ, 
so prudencia hoteþ and commaundeþ. 
Þe þridde, 
prudencia may be ilikned to þe matier 
in þe whiche it is occupide tofore. 
Prudencia, 
þe whiche is ioccupide in workes and dedes, and workes and dedes bien singuler, 
prudencia mot be ioccupiede 
with singuler and particuler dedes and applie general rules and singuler 
dedes 
as it is declared, 
vi Ethicorum. 
Þanne in comparisoun to þe matier 
in þe whiche it is occupide, 
prudencia may be discreued in þis wise: 
prudencia is a vertue 
þat takeþ hede 
and demeþ particular dedes by general rules; 
and suche general rules 
beeþ good lawes 
and þewe vsage and customes 
by þe whiche we may be irewled in workes and dedes. 
Þe ferþe, 
prudencia is ilikned to sciens 
fram þe whiche it is distyngwed, 
for propreliche to speke sciens 
is [of] ‡nescessarie þynges þat chaungeþ not as Bois seith, primo Arithmetrice, 
and seith 
þat sciencia is of þynges 
þat chaungeþ not. 
Prudencia is of workes and of dedes of mankynde 
and of þynges 
þat chaungeth 
and is in owre power 
to do oþer to leue. 
Þerfore as | prudencia and sciencia bien diuerse, 
prudencia may be diffined and discreued in þis wise: 
prudencia is rithtful reson of þynges 
þat chaungeth and beth in oure power. 
Þe fifthe, 
prudencia may be ilikned to art 
and to craft fram 
þe whiche he is destingwed, 
for art is of thinges 
þat may be wrouƷt and imade 
and required not riƷtfulle wille and prudencia 
is of workes and of dedes and requireth riƷtful wille and appetite. 
Þerfore it is iwrite, 
vi Ethicorum, 
þat artifex, 
þe craftes man, 
þat failleth wilfulliche 
is beter þan he þat failleth ayenst his wille; 
and prudens, 
he þat hatte prudencia 
and failleth wilfulliche, 
is worse. 
Þanne in workes 
and in dedes 
þat serueth to art and to craft, 
bettre it is to faille wilfulliche þanne vnwilfulliche; 
but in workes and dedes 
þat serueth to þe lif 
in þe whiche workes 
and dedes prudencia is occupied, 
worse it is to faille wilfulliche þanne vnwilfulliche. 
Þanne for no man 
may be prudens and haue prudencia, 
but he be good and haue riƷtful wille, 
prudencia is not ars but a vertue. 
Þan as prudencia is likned to art fram 
þe whiche it is destingwed, 
it may be diffined in þis wise: 
prudencia is riƷtful reson of workes and dedes 
and requireth riƷtful wille. 
Of alle þese we may make on discripcioun of prudencia 
and say þat prudencia 
is a vertue intellectuale, 
þat ruleth vertues moral and hoteth 
and commaundeth by þynges 
þat bien ifounde and idemed and takeþ hede and demeth, 
by general particula[r] reules, werkes and dedes 
þat chaungeth and varieth and requireth rigƷtful wille. Chapter VII 
For it is iseie 
what is prudencia 
and declared þat by prudencia 
we bien iruled ariƷt to good ende to þe whiche ende we | 
beth enclined by vertues moral, 
it is to declarynge 
þat it is semelich 
þat kynges and princes be prudentes, 
and haue þis vertue prudencia. 
As it longeth to þis doyng a kyng schal take most hede 
to þre þynges: first, 
it longeth to hym to take hede 
þat he be verrey kyng in dede 
and nouƷt onlich in name. 
Þe secunde, 
he schulde studie bisiliche 
þat his principate 
be not turned in to tirandyse. 
Þe þridde, 
he schal studie bisiliche 
þat he be kyndelich lord. 
Þanne by þre weyes we may declare 
þat it is semeliche toa kyng 
to be prudens. 
First, 
forwithoute prudencia 
he isnouƷt verrey kyng 
in dede 
but onlich in name; 
þe seconde, 
lest he turne to tiranny; 
the third, 
for withoute prudencia 
he may not be kyndelich lord. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise: 
a[s] þis name kyng is a name of offis and dignite, 
for a kyngis offis 
is to gouerne 
and to rule his puple 
in to þe þew ende 
and þat is knowe 
by a kynges Latyn name, 
þat is rex, 
and comeþ of regendo, 
gouemynge and reulynge, 
þanne gouemynge and reulynge of oþer men 
in to þew ende is by prudencia. 
And so, vi Ethicorum, 
it is seid in þis wise, 
we holdeþ hem prudentes 
þat may se and knowe and purueye good 
to hemself and to oþere. 
Þanne se and knowe tofore honde 
is a certeyn yge, 
by þe whoche good [is] iseye and iknowe a þew ende. 
Þanne he [þat] lackeþ þis eiƷe may not see at folle 
þat good noþer 
þat þew ende, 
in to þe whiche þe puple 
schulde be gouerned and ruled. 
Þanne as an archer 
þat myƷt nouƷt rule his schote 
to þe marke 
but Ʒif he seþe þe marke, 
so noþer a kyng may rule þe puple 
and gouerne 
in to þew ende 
but he see and knowe þat ende by prudencia.35 40 5 Þanne for wiþoute | prudencia 
no [man] may gouerne and rule þe puple 
and brynge hem to a þew ende, 
wiþoute prudencia no man is verrei kyng in dede 
and as a scholde 
þei he be ifeyned a kyng 
and icleped kyng by name. 
For it semeth þat a man withoute prudencia iset in kynges dignite 
is as a counter of bras oþer of leed ileyd 
in acounttes of marchaundise. 
For marchauntes acountteþ and leggeth som tyme a counter of bras 
oþer of leed 
in stede of a þousand pounde; 
and so þe counter 
þat is not worthy oon 
ey stondeþ 
for þe valewe of greet prise. 
Þanne þat counter is signe 
and tokene of valewe 
and is not worthi þe valewe. So Ʒif a man withoute prudencia 
is in dignite of a kyng, 
for he is of a litel valew 
and is iset in stede of greet valew, 
he is signe of a kyng 
and not verrey kyng. 
Þanne to be verrey kyng 
in dede and nouƷt onliche icleped kyng by name, 
it is semelich 
þat he haue prudencia. 
Þe secunde, 
þat is semelich to hym 
lest he turne ÜƷtliche to tyrandise, 
for it is seid 
þat by prudencia 
we bien igouerned and reuled and ibrouƷt to good ende 
to þe whoche ende we beþ inclined by vertues morale. He þat is prudens schal knowe and porueye good 
to hym and to oþere and gouerne and reuleþ hym and oþere to þe best ende. 
Þanne Ʒif a man lackeþ prudencia 
by þe whiche we bien iruled 
to þe best good in dede, 
liƷtliche he bycometh a tyraunt; 
for richesse and outward goodes, 
þat semeth hym best, 
he troweth þat he be þe best in dede; 
and for þei þat beþ not prudentes 
knoweth not but sencible good 
as richesse and outward good, 
an vnwys kyng withoute prudencia, 
for he knoweth not ne telleþ pris 
but of sencible good, 
he leueth vertues | and setteth 
al his studie to gadery and haue greet richesse and sencible good. 
Þanne he schal spoyle and robbe þe puple 
and by lord by tyraundyse and recche not 
in what manere wyse 
he may gadery richesse and money. 
Þe þridde, 
it is semelich 
þat kynges haue prudencia 
for þerwiþoute 
þei mowe not be kyndelich lordes. 
For as it is declared, 
i Poleticorum, 
þat som man is kyndeliche a seruaunt 
for a failleth intellecte 
and vnderstondyng 
and can not rule hymself. 
And som man is kyndeliche a lord 
for he hath good intellecte, 
vnderstondyng and prudencia and can rule hymself and oþere in to þew and good manere and ende. 
NouƷt onlich philosofres alloweth 
and preyseth þis vertue 
but also alle gouernans confermeth þe preysyng of þis vertue. 
For we seyen þat kyndelich men hauen lordschipes of bestes, 
and men of wommen, 
and olde men of children. 
Kyndeliche men hauen lordeschipe of bestes 
for in mankynde is prudencia, 
and of prudencia 
and of art bestes hauen litel part. 
Also men bien lordes of wymmen, 
for as it is declared, 
i Politicorum, 
a womman hath feble counsaile for comunliche 
a womman failleth 
and lacketh prudencia of men. And Ʒif som wemmen bien prudentes, 
oþer more prudentes þan men, 
þat is but selde 
and fewe suche bien ifunde. 
Þanne for þe more del womman schal be kyndeliche soget to man 
for kyndeliche here lacketh to þe prudencia of man. 
Also in þis wise it is semelich to Ʒongelinges 
to be kyndelich soget to olde men, 
for þei bien not expert in workes 
and in dedes noþer hauen 
so greet prudencia 
as oolde men hauen. 
Þanne eueriche where som is kyndelich seruaunt, 
somme is kyn|delich a lord. 
Vpon a prince is greet prudencia 
and þerof failleth he þat is kyndelich a seruant. 
Þanne so þat a kyng be kyndelich a lord it nedeth þat he haue greet prudencia 
and intellecte and vnderstondyng. Chapter VIII 
For no thing is ihad hoolich and parfiteliche 
but alle þe parties 
þerof be ihad also. 
Þerfore Ʒif a man schal be parfitliche prudens 
hym nedeþ to haue 
alle þat conquereth to prudencia 
and alle þe parties þerof. 
Comonliche eiƷte parties of prudencia 
beþ asignyd: memoria, mynde; forsiƷte and poruyans; intellecte, vnderstondyng; racio, resoun; solercia, 
wys besynesse, scley and war; docilitas, abelnesse to leme and to teche; experiencia, redy assay; 
and caucio, redy wamesse. 
Wherfore Ʒif a kyng oþer a prince schulde be prudens hym nedeth 
to be of good mynde 
and forsite and poruyance 
and intelligent and vnderstondynge; 
resonable, wislich besy, sleigh and war; 
able to lerne and to teche; 
and knowyng workes 
and dedes by assay; 
and wisliche warre. 
And þes eiƷte parties of pmdencia 
may be itake in þis wise, 
for as it is declared tofore honde 
a man is icleped prudens 
for he is suffisaunt to gouerne hymself and oþere to good ende. 
Þanne here we schul take hede of foure: 
of þe good endes to þe whiche he gouemeþ and reuleth; 
of þe manere in þe whiche he gouemeth and ruleth; 
and of þe persone and þe puple 
þe whiche he gouemeth and ruleth. 
By resoun of þe good to þe whiche he gouerneth and reuleth, 
it nedeth a kyng to be of gode mynde of forsight and pumyaunce. 
For þe manere in þe whiche he gouemeþ and reuleth 
hym nedeth to be intelligent and vnderstondyng and resonable. 
By cause of his owne persone þat gouerneth and reuleth 
oþere hym nedeth to be wis|liche besy, sleigh and ware and able to lerne and teche and redy and warre; 
for Ʒif a kyng schal gouerne 
and rule men 
and puple to good ende, 
hym nedeþ to haue 
in mynde of þynges 
þat bien apassed 
and be war of þynges 
þat schal come. 
For we schul haue mynde of þynges 
þat bien apassed, 
not þat [we] may chaunge þynges 
þat bien apassed, 
for þat may no worldlich man do, 
but it is semelich 
þat a kyng haue 
in mynde of þynges 
þat bien apassed 
þat he may þerby knowe 
what may befalle herafter. 
For it is iwrete, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
in workes and dedes þat chaungeth, 
for þe more deel þynges þat schal come 
ben [lyche to] þynges þat bien apassed. 
Pe seconde, 
it nedeth to knowe 
and be war of þynges 
þat schal come, 
for men þat knoweth and beeth war of good þynges 
þat bien to comynge bythynkeþ and casteth 
by what weyes he may best come þerto. 
Þanne by cause of good to þe whiche a kyng schal rule 
and goueme his men and his puple, 
it is nedful 
þat he knowe and be war [of þynges þat schal come], 
þat he may þe bettre come þerto. 
And it is spedful þat he haue mynde of þynges 
þat bien apassed 
þat he may þerby wete 
and knowe what he schal do here after. 
And by cause of þe manere 
in þe whiche he gouerneth and reuleth it 
nedeth 
þat he haue intellecte, 
vnderstondyng and resoun; 
for þe manere in þe whiche a kyng gouerneth and reuleth his men 
and his puple 
mot be manere of mankynde, 
for a kyng is a man and a man 
vnderstondeth makynge resouns 
and discurrynge and taketh knowleche of oon by anoþer; 
for he takeþ certeyn principales and certeyne premyssis, 
of þe whiche he draweth and takeþ conclusions 
þat he wol haue and þat bien in speculatif 
and in actif workes and dedes. 
For as resons bien imad to schewe and proue to | knowe what is soth, 
so bien resouns imad for euidence 
to knowe 
what is good to wynne and to gete. 
Þanne by cause of suche connynge and knowleche 
þat is iƷeue to mankynde, 
he þat wol rule 
oþere mot be intelligent, 
vnderstondyng and knowyng principles and prtemissis] 
and he mot be resonable 
and konne make resons and drawe and take of þe premissis conclusions 
þat he wol haue; 
oþer he mot be intelligens, 
vnderstondyng and knowyng good lawes, 
vsages and custumes and oþere 
þat may be principlis and rules of workes and dedes; 
and he mot be resonable 
and knowe and se by þilke rules 
what is to doynge. 
Þanne as by cause of good to þe whiche he gouerneth and reuleth, 
it nedeth a kyng haue mynde and knowe and be war; 
so by cause of þe manere 
in þe whiche he gouerneth and reuleth 
hym nedeth to be intelligent, 
vnderstondyng and resonable. 
But by cause of his owne persone 
þat gouerneth and reuleth oþere, 
hym byhoueth to be wyselich besy, redilich sligh and ware, 
and able to lerne and to teche; 
for he þat is iset so highe and hath so moche to gouerne and to reule 
mot be besy and wislich ware 
þat he may knowe and fynde of hymsilf 
what is good to his men and his puple. 
Also for no man 
is suffisaunt to bethenke al thing 
þat may be good and profitable 
to alle þe regne, 
with al þat þat is spedful 
to a kyng 
to be besy and sligh of hymself to bethenke 
what is good and profitable to þe regne, 
hym nedeth to be able to lerne, 
and to do by counsaile of oþere men. 
We may saye of a kyng 
þat is iseid of magnanimus, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
þat it is not semelich 
to hym to fle and voyde warnyng, 
for it is not semelich to a kyng 
to folwe his owne heed 
in alle þynges | 
nother alwey triste 
in his owne sleighthe; 
but hym nedeth be able to leme 
þat he be able to take doctrine and lore of oþere 
and do bi lore 
and conseille of þe eldeste wise barons 
þat loueþ þe regne. 
And so it is declared þat by cause of his owne persone 
þat gouemeth and reuleth 
oþere it nedeth a kyng to be wisliche besy, 
sleigh and war, 
but by cause of men and puple 
þat he gouerneth and ruleth hym 
nedeth to be expert and ware. 
And for experiencia is of particuler þyngis, 
þerfore as diuerse þynges ben particuler 
and as a man is occupide 
aboue diuerce men and puple, 
so diuers þynges mote be knowe. 
Than it nedeth a prince 
to be expert touchyng men and puple, 
þat he is euere knowynge particuler condicions of þe puple 
þat he hath to kepyng 
þat he may þe bettre gouerne 
and reule hym to good ende. 
Þe laste, hym nedeth to be war 
as in speculatif falsnesse 
is som tyme imedled with sothnesse, 
wherfore som thynges 
þat bien not soth bot semeth soth ben itrowed as for soth, 
so in workes and in dedes 
yuel is medled wiþ good 
wherfore somme thinges 
bien trowed goode 
and bien not goode but semen goode. 
Þerfore it nedeth a kyng to be ware and forsake thing 
þat is not good 
but in semynge, 
and chese þyng þat is good in dede to þe whiche he schal gouerne and rule men and puple 
þat he hath to kepynge. Chapter IX 
In settynge and restynge þe saule is imade prudens 
as þe philosofre meneth, 
vii Poleticorum; 
þanne Ʒif kynges and princes desiren to be prudentes 
he scholde not be occupied in vanite 
but he schulde spende þe more deel of here 
lyf tyme in þynkynge and castynge 
what may be good 
and profitable for þe rewme. 
Bot þis schal not be vnderstonde 
in þis wise, 
menynge þat kynges and princes schulde haue no pleyes and ga|mes, 
but þei schulle vse pleyes and games so moderatliche 
þat þei be not lette in rewlynge of þe rewme. 
Þenne þey mow make hemself 
prudentes to reule kyndelich þe regne. 
Firste, hauynge in mynde tymes 
þat bien apassed in þe whiche tymes 
þe regne was best ireuled, 
þerfore he schal haue mynde ofte tyme of tymes 
þat bien passed by þe whiche he may knowe 
whaat is to done herafter. 
For a kyng schal alwey confourme his reulyng 
to þe reule 
þat is apassed 
vnder þe whiche rulyng 
þe regne 
was most siker and best iruled. 
For as be seyng and knowyng and hauyng in mynde writyng of oolde philosofres we bien þe more wis in speculatif matier, 
so kynges and princes hauynge in mynde actus and dedes of here 
predecessours 
may be þe more prudentes in workes, actus and dedes. 
[Þe seconde], kynges and princes schulle besily take heede and haue in mynde goode 
þat may falle heraffter 
and be profitable 
to þe regne and euel and harme 
þat may greue, 
for þerby he schal knowe 
what may befalle 
and be war to voide þe soner yuel and harme and come 
þe bettre and þe sonere to good. 
Þe þridde, þe kyng schal ofte þynke and haue in mynde good custumes and vsages and goode lawes, 
for suche bien most principles in workes and in dedes, 
[as] þe intellect and – vnderstondyng is of principles. 
Þanne þe mo goode lawes, 
vsages and custumes 
a kyng hath in mynde 
by þe whiche he may wete and knowe 
what is to doynge in eueriche nede, 
þe more is þe intellecte and vnderstondyng ‡ occupied aboute actus and dedes. 
Þe ferthe, 
ofte he schal thinke and avise hym how he may reule þe regne ariƷt 
bi suche good lawes, customes and vsages and take þerof goode conclusions of actus and dedes. 
For it is not inowƷ | 
to vnderstonde and knowe lawes, customes and vsages 
þat bien principles of actus and dedes, 
but a man be racionale 
to drawe and to take 
of suche lawes, 
custumes and vsages 
þew conclusions of nedus, workes and dedes. 
And how þat schal be do 
we schal declare atte þe folle 
in þe þridde [bok]e, 
þere we schulle trete of rulyng of regnes. 
Þanne kynges takyng hede to þilke eiƷte 
þat bien requyred to prudencia, 
of þe whiche we makeþ mencioun in þis chapitre, 
mowe make hemself prudentes. Bot for malice corumpeth a prince 
as he þat hath corup 
tast demeth euel of sauors, 
for þyng þat is swete þey wenen 
þat it is bitter and aƷenward, 
so he þat hath a schrewed wil and infecte is blent 
in his wit 
and vnderstondyng 
and demeþ euele of actus and dedes. 
For what is not to doynge þey demen 
þat it is to doynge and aƷenward. 
And so it is wel iseid, 
vi Ethicorum, 
þat it is inpossible 
to be prudens and not good, 
for malice makeþ euel dome 
and schrewede and makeþ a man withoute prudencia and vnwisliche for malice 
þat makeþ schrewed wille. 
Þerfore Ʒif kynges and princes 
wol be prudentes 
þey mote haue goode mynde 
and forknowynge 
and wisliche besy, sleigh and war, 
and haue oþere disposiciouns 
þat we speke of tofore. 
Hem nedeþ to be good 
withoute schrewed wille 
lest he do vnwisliche and vnredyliche for malice of appetite, 
and lest he deme of what is not to doynge 
þat it is to doyng. Chapter X The philosofre, 
in v Ethicorum, 
distinguit double iusticia: legalis and equalis. Legalis iusticia 
is som what general 
and in som manere euerich vertue. 
And iusticia equalis 
is som what special and som particular vertue: 
for a man is iustus and legalis 
for he | holdeth and folfilleth 
þe comaundement of þe lawe. 
But as it is seid, 
primo Magnorum Moralium, 
lawe commaundeþ actus 
and dedes of alle vertues, 
for lawe commaundeþ workes 
and dedes of þe vertue 
þat hatte fortitudo and workes 
and dedes of temporancia, 
and generalliche alle vertues dedes. 
And so þer it is iseid 
þat iusticia legalis is parfits vertue. 
Also, v Ethicorum, 
it is wrete þat lawe comaundeth 
þat no man schal forsake þe scheltrom and þe ost noþer fleƷ away, 
noþer throwe away armour noþer wepone, 
and þes longeth to þe vertue fortitudo; 
and commaundeþ þat no man schal do spouse breche 
and þat longeþ to temporancia; 
and comaundeþ þat no man schal 
smyte noþer stryue 
and þat longeþ to vertu mansuetudo. 
Þanne generalliche lawe hoteþ 
to fulfille alle vertues 
and fle alle malice. 
Þerfore iusticia legalis 
þat is þe implecioun of lawe 
is in som wise euerich vertue. 
And iusticia equalis 
is a certeyn vertue special 
bi 
þe whiche eueriche man rekeneth rigt and equite 
and what is his owne. 
Þe diuersete of þis twey vertues of iusticia 
may be take in þis wise. 
For as it is iwrete in v Ethicorum, 
iusticia is in ordre to oþere. 
Þanne as citeseyns hauen ordre euerich to oþere 
and to þe comyn profit 
and to hym 
þat Ʒeueth þe lawe 
and to þe kyng, 
and so is among hem iusticia legalis and equalis, 
for among cetesenes Ʒif þei hauen suche an ordre, 
oþer axeþ comyn good 
oþer special good and proper, 
Ʒif comyn good is axed 
so is among hem iusticia legalis, 
and Ʒif propir good is axed 
so is among hem iusticia equalis. 
For comyn good and profitƷ cometh 
of alle good and profitƷ of ceteseyns. 
For þe comyn profit 
and alle þe citee is better 
þan singuler profit hou euere þe citeseyns bien good; 
where þei bien good in hemself, 
oþere in ordre to oþere, 
al|wey þat citee is best 
þat is best of citeseynes. 
And in þe mo manere wise 
þe citeseyns bien goode, 
þe bettre is þe citee. 
Þanne lawes þat bien iordeyned 
for comyn good and profit [bryngeth forth] 
al manere of goodnesse. 
Þanne by riƷtful by lawe and fulfille iusticia legalis 
is to folwe al good and to voide and fle alle vices 
and haue in som wyse al vertue. 
Þerfore iusticia legalis 
is cleped in som wise al vertue for it 
vseth actus and dedes of alle vertues. 
Iusticia legalis 
is not in dede al vertue 
for it 
is distingwyd 
fro alle eche oþere vertue; 
but it is cleped all vertue 
for it 
determyneth not to hymself special mater, 
and suche iusticia is distingwed 
fro euerich oþer vertue in tweyne. 
For þei iustus legalis 
do þe same workes and dedes 
þat doþ fortis and temporatus, 
Ʒut he doþ hem not 
in þe same entent 
and by þe same formal resoun; 
for he þat doþ actus and dedes of fortitudo 
and hath likynge 
in suche actus 
and dedes is icleped fortis, 
and he þat doþ dedes of temporancia 
for he hath likyng þerinne is icleped temporatus. 
But he þat doþ suche actus and dedes 
and not 
for he hath likynge þerinne 
but for þe lawe commaundeþ 
and hoteþ suche actus and dedes 
and he wol fulfille þe lawe, 
he is cleped iustus legalis. 
Þanne iustus legalis 
in so moche 
þat he is suche oon 
he hath principal likynge 
in folfillyng of þe lawe. 
Ʒif he hath likyng in workesof oþere vertues, 
þat isby consequentfolwynge 
forso moche 
as lawe commandeþ 
alle suche actus and dedes. 
Andfortus and temporatus and profite in oþere vertues 
haþ first principalliche likynge in workes and dedes of suche vertues; 
and Ʒif he hath likynge 
in fulfilƷ lynge of þe lawe 
þat is by consequent folwynge 
for so moche 
as in doyng | 
of workes and dedes he fulfilleþ þe lawe. 
Of þis diuersite folweþ þe seconde, 
for whan fortis and temporatus 
hath likyng in workes and dedes of suche vertues, 
þilke vertues maken hym 
þat hath suche vertues parfit5 in hymself in so moche he is a þyng in hymself. 
But iustus legalis 
hath likyng 
in suche actus 
and dedes for in so moche 
as he fulfilleþ þe lawe iusticia legalis 
makeþ hym nouƷt parfit 
onlich in hymsilf, 
but it makeþ hym parfit 
in ordre to þe lawe. 
Þe prince Ʒeueth þe lawe 
and þe citees 
geueþ forþ to hem 
þat bien soget to þe commandementis of þe prince 
þat geueþ þe lawe. 
Þa[nne] he ‡ þat is parfit 
in ordre to þe lawe, 
is parfite in ordre to þe prince 
þat Ʒeueþ þe lawe, 
oþer in ordre to al þe citee to þe whiche þe lawe is iƷeue. 
Þanne þei5 iusticia legalis 
do þe same actus and dedes 
þat doþ temporancia and fortitudo, 
Ʒit it makeþ a man parfit 
in ordre to oþer 
as in ordur to þe prince 
oþer to þe citee, 
not wyþstondynge 
þat temporancia and fortitudo 
and oþere suche vertues 
makeþ þe soule parfite in hymself. 
And so it is declared 
how iusticia legalis 
is in som wise eueriche vertue 
and how it determeþ 
not special mater to itsilf, 
but doþ actus and dedes of alle vertues. 
But iusticia equalis 
is not eueriche vertue 
noþer doþ actus and dedes of alle vertues, 
but determyneth to itself special matier; 
for þerinne þe entent is special good and profit, 
for þey in what manere it euere be 
þat a citesen is good 
þerof comeþ comyn good and profit, 
and þe cite es þe bettre; 
and how it euer be 
þat a citeseyn is euel, 
þe citee is þe worse. 
Þerfore natheles not of eueriche goodnesse 
of a citeseyn in hymself 
for he is suche oon ‡comeþ goodnesse ofanoþer citeseyn, 
noþer | eueriche schrewednesse 
of on citeseyn 
doþ harme to anoþer cyteseyn. 
But Ʒif a citeseyn is euel in owtward good and catel so þat he wol haue more þerof þanne his owne 
and more þan oþere men, 
þanne þerof comeþ harm 
to oþere ceteseyns; 
for Ʒif he haue more þerof þan he scholde, 
þanne oþere haueþ þe lasse. 
Þanne iusticia special, 
by þe whiche special harme is voided 
in so moche as malice of þe citeseyn doþ harme to anoþer, 
determineth to itsilf special matier 
and stondeþ in þe outward good 
and catel in þe whiche citeseyns comuneth and hauen part. 
And so þis iusticia 
is icleped iusticia equalis, 
for it stondeþ principaliche in equite, 
riƷt and euenes, 
þat eueriche man haue of suche good and catel as equite wol and euene riƷt. 
Þerfore it is seid 
þat þis iusticia Ʒeldeþ to eueriche man his owne ryƷt, 
for riƷt stondeþ 
in a certeyn equite 
and þus þis iusticia Ʒeldeþ to eueriche man 
what is equite; 
and so it is iseid 
þat þis iusticia Ʒeldeþ to euerich man his owne, 
for it is equite and rigt 
þat eueriche man haue his owne. 
Þanne Ʒif þes special iusticia 
is cleped equalis and stant in equite and euenes, 
and citeseyns bien partiners 
and hauen suche good and catel 
vneuenliche somme more and some lasse and þat in double manere, 
þerfore suche particuler iusticia is doubled; 
and it happeþ 
þat som men hauen suche good and catel, 
onlich som more and somme lasse, 
by commitacioun and chaungyng 
as in byggyng and sellyng, 
borwyng and lenyng and settyng to hyre. 
For it happeth in bying and sellyng, 
in borwyng and settyng to hire, 
to geue lite and fonge moche agenward 
and þat may not be withoute inequalite and vnequite. 
Also inequalite and vnequite 
is som tyme in distribucionis 
in reward and mede, 
for som tyme som men 
þat traueyleth more | 
for þe comyn profite fongeþ 
þe lasse rewarde and mede 
and so þis iusticia 
is som del apeyred; 
and for þe more del and comonliche men bien acceptours of persons 
and more fauorable to som persones 
þan to oþere and Ʒeueth distribucionis and Ʒiftis, worschip, 
and good and catel to vnworthi persones 
and putteþ of worthi persones. 
And so þer is double iusticia special: 
þat oon hatte commutatiua 
and stondeth in chaunge of thynges, 
and þe oþere hatte distributiua and stondeþ 
in geuyng and delyng of þynges. 
Þanne eueriche iusticia 
wheþer it be legalis 
oþer comutatiua 
oþer distributiua makeþ alwey a man parfit in ordre to oþere. 
But iusticia comutatiua 
and distributiua maken more a man parfit in ordre to oþere 
þan doþ iusticia legalis, 
but in caas here 
of we schul trete in oþer place. 
Here is so moche iseid 
þat þre bien declared 
þat were rehersed 
in þe begynnyng, 
in þe tenþe chapitre, 
for it is declared 
in how many manere iusticia is icleped. 
For som iusticia is general 
and is icleped legalis, 
and som is special 
and is icleped equalis, 
and þat is double, 
for som is distributiua and stondeþ 
in delyng of þynges 
and som is comutatiua and stondeþ in chaungyng of þynges. 
Also it is declared 
in what matiere stondeþ iusticia, 
for iusticia legalis stondeþ 
in al þe moral matere 
and in al þe workes 
and dedes of vertues, 
and not principaliche, 
but in so muche as þe lawes 
bien fulfilled þerby. 
Þe þridde, 
it is declared how iusticia 
is distyngwed 
fram oþere vertues 
for other vertues 
makeþ a man parfit in hymself; 
and iusticia, 
wher it be legalis 
oþer distributiua 
oþer commutatiua, 
makeþ a man parfit in ordre to oþere. Chapter XI 
Hit was seid in þe nexte chapitre byfore 
þat þer is twey maner of iusticia, 
oon general | and anoþer special. 
Ʒif regnes schal stonde sikerliche 
and dure in pees, 
eiþer iusticia is nedful. 
Þat regnes may not dure withoute general iusticia, 
we may preue by twey weyes. 
Þe first is itake by iusticia, 
and þe secunde by þe regne 
in suche iusticia 
in þe whiche is iholde. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise: 
for it is seide in þe nexte chapitre tofore þat iusticia legalis 
is in som wise iche vertue 
and he 
þat hath suche iusticia 
fulfilleþ þe lawe. 
Þanne Ʒif þe lawe commaundeth al good and forbedeth 
al euel and folfilleþ 
þe lawe is to be p[ar]fitliche vertuous, 
þerfore, primo Magnorum Moralium, 
capitulo De Iusticia, 
it is seid þat iusticia legalis 
is a parfit vertue. 
Þanne by þe contrarie iniusticia legalis 
is fol and hool malice. 
Þanne he þat holdeþ not 
in non wise lawes and citeseyns 
þat hauen no part of iusticia legalis 
bien iholde iuel atte þe folle. 
But as it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum, capitulo De Mansuetudine, 
þat euel destroyeth itself 
þey it be fol and hool. 
Þanne þat regne myƷte not be soffred noþer þat cite myƷte not dure Ʒif þe cyteseyns þerof were alle yuel and wolde nouƷt holde þe lawe 
noþer wold haue part 
in no wise of iusticia legalis. 
By þe selue iusticia legalis 
þat is a parfit vertue and contrarie to malice, 
it may be preued 
þat withoute iusticia legalis 
may nouƷt regnes stonde. 
Þe seconde for to declare 
þat same may be take 
by þe selue regne, 
for euerich regne and eueriche polecie 
is a certeyne ordre 
and a certeyn principate. 
Þanne for an ordre and a principate 
is bytwene sugettes and lawes 
and þe prince 
þat Ʒeueþ þe lawes, as it is declared in Poli[t]icis, 
Ʒif citeseyns hauen no part in iusticia legalis, 
among hem nys none ordre to lawes noþer to prince. 
Þanne among hem is no polecie ikept noþer regne noþer kyngdom dureth lenger among hem. 
Þanne it is ÜƷt to declare 
þat withoute iusticia legalis | 
may nouƷt regnes and kyngdomes dure. 
And þat withoute iusticia specialis, 
þat is dyuydid in iusticia comutatiua and distributiua, 
may not kyngdomes dure, 
it may be declared in þis wise: 
for euerich regne and eueriche congregacioun and gaderinge 
is ilikned to a certeyn kynde body. 
For as we seeþ þat in þe body 
of a beest bien diuerce membris and lemes ioned and iordeyned togedres, 
so in eueriche regne 
and in euery congregacioun ben diuers persones 
ioned and ordeyned 
to som thyng þat is on. 
Þan to speke by [l]eknes, 
in þe membres of þe same body 
is in som wise double iusticia commutatiua and distributiua. 
And proprelich for to speke of iusticia: 
iusticia is not but in ordre to oþer 
and is noƷt 
but bytwene diuers persones; 
noþeles by a maner liknes iusticia 
is in ordre of þe same thing to itself, 
and in þe membris of þe same body we may 
in som wise se and knowe iusticia. 
For þe membris of þe same body hauen ordre eche to oþer 
and bien iordeyned to oon certeyn membre 
as to þe herte, 
of þe whiche he fongeth meuyng 
and influens of lif. 
Þanne as þe membris hauen ordre 
eueriche to oþer, 
in hem is in som wise iusticia commutatiua; 
but as þei bien ordeyned to þe herte, 
in hem is in som wise iusticia distributiua. 
Iusticia commutatiua 
is among þynges 
for oon hath inowƷ 
of som thing and anoþer lackeþ 
þerof and faileþ 
in som oþer þyng of þe whiche anoþer hath inow. 
Þerfore for eueriche man schulde releue hymself at nede, 
iusticia commutatiua is ifounde; 
for it happeth þat som man hath moche money 
and anoþer noon 
and it happeþ 
þat he þat hath moche moneye 
hath non whete 
and he 
þat hath no moneye hath moche whete. 
Panne by iusticia commutatiua 
and by chaungyng suche passynge plente and defaute bien imade euene, 
for he þat hath money 
ynowe Ʒeueþ money and fongeþ whete þat hy[m] nedeth 
and þat oþer Ʒeueth whete 
þat | [he] hath in gret plente and fongeth money 
þat hym lacketh. 
Þanne iusticia commutatiua 
is whan oon ordeyneth his good and catel 
to help and profite of oþere and aƷenward. 
And þis manere doyng we fynden 
in þe membris of þe same body, 
for þe eyƷe is cleer and scharpe of siƷt 
and hath no potencial vertue of goyng, 
for þe eyƷe may not go; 
and þe foot may goo 
and lackeþ siƷt 
for þe foot may not see. 
Þanne þe eyƷe helpeth 
and reuleth þe foot by siƷt, 
for þe eyƷe reuleth þe foot 
and by potencial vertue of goynge 
þe foot helpeth þe eye, 
for þe foot bereth forþ the eyƷe. 
Þanne but þe membres helpe so eche oþer 
as but þe honde clanse 
þe eiƷe and þe eiƷe reule þe hond 
and but þe fote bere forþ 
þe heed 
and but þe heed rulede þe foot, 
kynde body myƷt not stonde and dure. 
So for no man is sufficient to hymself to lyue, 
but citeseyns by iusticia commutatiua halpe eueriche oþere 
as but it were so 
þat oon conneth to oþer thyng 
þat he hath in plente and fongeþ 
þyng þat hym lacketh, 
þe cite myƷt not stonde and dure. 
Þanne in þe membris of þe same body, 
as þei hauen ordre to hemself and eche to oþere 
and helpeþ ech oþer, 
in hem is commutatiua prudencia oþer iusticia 
withoute þe whiche kynde body may not dure. 
So for citeseyns of þe same cite oþer of þe same regne hauen ordre 
ech to oþer 
and helpeth ech oþer 
by certeyn commutacion and chaungyng of þynges, 
in hem is commutatiua iusticia 
wiþoute þe whiche noþer citee 
ne regne may stonde. 
Þe seconde, 
in membris is distributiua iusticia 
in þat he hath ordre to þe herte. 
‡ For by here proporcioun and dignite þe herte Ʒeueth to alle þe membris spirit of leuyng and meuyng. 
So þat þe principal and welle of lif and of meuyng 
is in þe herte 
as in caas þe welle of felyng 
is in þe brayn. 
And | so in cyteseyns is iusticia distributiua 
in þat þei ben ordeyned 
to a certeyn 
on as to þe kyng 
or to þe duk þat schal, 
as þei bien vertues and worthi, 
Ʒeue ham and dele 
among hem worschep and Ʒiftes and good and catel. 
Þanne as a kynde body 
may not stonde and dure 
but Ʒif þer be in<ne> 
som iusticia distributiua 
as þat þe herte Ʒeue to þe membris 
in þew manere vertues and spirit of lif and meuyng, 
so no regne noþer cite may stonde and dure 
but þerinne be iusticia distributiua 
so þat þe kyng oþer þe duk Ʒeue and dele worschep and good and catel in þew manere. 
But it is bysiliche to wytynge 
þat as not ech inequalite 
bynemeth þe lif of kynde body, 
but eche inequalite 
is cause of sekenesse 
and of euel þerinne, 
so not euerich iniusticia corumpeth and destroyeth holliche þe regne and polici; 
but by ech iniusticia, wrong, 
þe regne and polici 
is apeyred and disposed to corupcioun and be destroyed. 
And so it is declared 
þat as citeseyns hauen ordre 
ech to oþer, 
in hem is iusticia commutatiua; 
and as þei hauen ordre to kyng oþer to prince, 
in hem is iusticia distributiua; 
and in þat he willeþ þe lawe, 
in hem is iusticia legalis. 
But how ech iusticia be take, 
þerwithoute no regne noþer citee may stonde. 
Þanne it is wel iseid, 
primo Magnorum Moralium, 
capitulo De Iusticia, 
þat ‡ iuste is a certeyn preporcional and conteyneth townes, 
and [as þe soule conteyneþ þe body, 
for þerwiþoute þe body is dissolued and scbrynkeþ, 
so iusticia conteyneþ townes, 
þat is] citees and regnes, 
for þerwiþoute no cite 
ne regne may stonde. 
Þanne he þat holdeþ not iusticia 
don greet wrong 
boþe to þe regne 
and to þe kyng. 
Þanne Ʒif iusticia 
is so good to þe regne 
and to þe kyng, 
þe kyng schal 
with most besinesse studie 
and do þat iusticia be kept 
and iholde in his regne, 
and not oonliche to hem 
þat bien ibore in þe regne 
but also to pilgrymes, 
to alyenes and to straungers; 
for who þat euere | 
is werned iusticia, 
open wrong is ido to þe kyng and to þe regne. Chapter XII 
By þe nexte chapitre tofore, 
it is declared cleer inow þat kynges and princes schulde be riƷtful and iuste 
and þey schulde kepe and holde riƷtwisnesse and iusticia 
for þerwithoute no regne 
ne citee may stonde. 
But for mannes wit is gentil and noble and desireth alwey 
to hire newe resouns, 
we schulle brynge forþ newe maners 
by þe whiche it may be declared 
þat it is most semelich 
þat kynges and princes be riƷtful and iuste. 
And we may declare þis soþnesse and trouthe by ‡ foure weyes, 
by ━þe┐ foure 
þat bien itouched de iusticia in v Ethicorum. 
Þe firste wey is itake 
by þe persone of þe kyng; 
þe seconde, 
by þe selue iusticia; 
þe þridde, 
by þe parfite goodnesse 
þat cometh of iusticia; 
and þe ferþe, 
by þe malice 
þat cometh of iniusticia, wrong. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise: 
Ʒif þe lawe is reule of actus and dedes, 
as it is iseid in v Ethicorum, 
þe iuge and namliche þe kyng 
þat Ʒeueth þe lawe schulde be a certeyn rule 
in actus and dedis. 
For a kyng oþere a prince is a certeyne lawe 
and þe lawe 
is a certeyne kyng oþer a prince. 
For þe lawe is þe certeyn <vn>soule<d> prince 
and þe prince is a certeyn souled lawe; 
þanne in as moche as þe souled þyng passeþ þe <vn>sawle<d> þyng, 
in so moche a kyng oþere a prince schulde passe þe lawe. 
For a kyng oþer a prince schulde be riƷtful and iust and haue so gret iusticia and equite 
þat he myƷte rule þe lawe Ʒif þer fille a certeyn caas 
in þe whiche þe lawe schulde not be holde 
as it schal be declared inneremore. 
Þanne to axe a doute Ʒif þe kyng schulde haue equite, 
euennes and be iust, 
it is to axe a doute Ʒif þe reule schulde be reuled; 
for Ʒif þe | reule be not euene, 
no thing is reuled, 
for al þyng þat is reuled 
is ireuled by þe reule. 
So Ʒif kynges be not iuste 
þey desposen þe regne 
þat iusticia 
be not ikept 
and iholde þerinne. 
Þanne kynges schul most studie to be iuste 
and do equite for here iniusticia and vnequite 
bynemeth hem maieste and dignite of kynges. 
For kynges þat bieth not iuste, 
þeig þat þei be lordes by cyuyle myƷt and strengþe, 
gut þei bien not worthi to be kynges; 
for it is semelich 
þat þe rule be riƷt and euene. 
And for a kyng 
is a manere sauled lawe 
and a manere souled reule of actus and dedes, 
it is most semelich 
touchyng his awne persone 
þat he kepe and holde iusticia. 
Þe secounde, 
we may declare þe same 
by þe silue iusticia, 
for iusticia is ful good and noble; 
as it is iseyd, 
it makeþ man parfit 
in ordre to oþer. 
And oure godenesse is most iknow 
whan it strecheþ to oþer, 
and so it is iseid in v Ethicorum 
þat iusticia 
is acounted most passyng clere vertue. 
And so it is iseid 
þat not Vesperus noþer Lucifer 
is so briƷt as iusticia. 
Vesperus and Lucifer 
is al on sterre 
and is ful fair and briƷt 
and is comonliche cleped Venus 
for fairenesse þerof; 
for Venus is a planet 
and som tyme þis sterre goþ 
before þe sonne 
and is þanne iseyƷe erlich 
in þe dawenyng 
and is þanne icleped Lucifer 
þe day sterre. 
And þe same sterre cometh 
som tyme after þe sonne 
and is iseye in þe eue tyde and is þanne icleped Vesperus 
þe eue sterre. 
Þanne þe philosofre wol mene þat seþþe þat Venus, 
þat is so faire a sterre 
and is som tyme icleped Lucifer, 
þe day sterre ‡, 
and som tyme Vesperus, 
þe eue sterre, 
is not so faire and so briƷt as iusticia, 
þe fairenesse of sterres 
is not so wonderful as þe fairenesse of iusticia. 
Þe sterres passeth in bodilich fairenesse 
and byschyneth vs with bodilich liƷt, 
but iusticia passeth 
in honest fairenesse 
and spiritual and ÜƷteth vs 
with vertual perfec|cioun. 
Þanne a[s] spiritual feirnesse passeth bodylich fairenesse, 
so þe fairenesse of iusticia and clernesse þerof 
is more wonderful 
þan clemesse of sterres. 
Þanne Ʒif it is semelich 
þat kynges and princes 
haue most cleere vertues by iusticia 
þat is most cleer vertue, 
it may be preued 
þat it is semelich ‡ 
þat kynges and princes kepe and holde iusticia. 
Þe þridde, 
þe same may be preued 
by parfit goodnesse 
þat is iknowe and cometh of iusticia; 
for iusticia is not onliche parfit vertue in itsilf, 
but [Ʒif] it is in kynges and princes, 
þey schewen þat þei bien parfite and good. 
For as we seeþ 
in oþere þynges þat euerich þyng is parfit 
whan it may gendre and brede forþ 
thyng ileche to itself, 
and whanne his worchyng 
and doyng streccheþ 
to oþere þynges, 
as a þyng is parfitlich hote 
whan it may hete oþere þynges; 
and whanne worchynge and doyng þerof streccheth to oþere, 
and a man is parfitliche connynge 
whanne he may teche oþere, 
and whanne his connynge streccheth to oþere: 
þerfore it is iwrete, 
primo Methaphisicomm, 
þat þe parfite tokene of a connyng man 
is 
þat he may teche; 
þanne in þe same wise, 
þanne a man is parfitlich good 
whanne his goodnesse streccheth to oþere. 
Þerfore it is þat mannes parfit goodnesse 
is not iknowe 
but he be iset 
in som manere principate, 
for while a man hath to reulynge but hymself, 
it is not iknowe 
atte þe ful wheþer he is good oþer euel noþer his goodnesse 
is parfitliche iknowe. 
But whan he is iset in som principate, 
for his goodnesse mot strecche to oþere, 
þanne it is better iknowe whiche he is 
for his workes 
and dedes streccheth to oþere. 
Þanne for outward thynges bien most iknowe to vs, 
in þe grettre principate 
a man is iset, 
þe bettere it is iknowe 
whiche he is, 
for his workes and dedes | 
streccheth to mo thinges. 
Þerfore it is seid in v Ethicorum 
þat principate scheweth whiche a man is. 
Þerfore it is iseide 
in a prouerbe Ʒif a man wol knowe whiche anoþer man is, 
sette hym in sum principate. 
By iusticia 
þat is in ordre to oþere parfite goodnesse is iknow. 
For outtake prudencia, 
þat is more parfite 
þan oþere vertues, 
for it reuleþ 
alle oþere vertues morale, 
alle oþere vertues morale 
þat maketh man parfit 
in hymself haueþ 
a manere ordre to iusticia 
þat makeþ a man parfit in ordre to oþere, 
as sogettes 
þat in som wise reuleth onlich hemself hauen ordre to þe prince 
whos goodnes 
and rewlyng streccheþ to oþere. 
Þanne as in a prince parfite goodnes 
is more iknowe þan in oþere men, 
so by iusticia parfite godenesse 
is more iknowe þan 
by oþer vertues moral. 
Þan it is semelich 
þat kynges and princes scholde be iuste for þei scho[l]de be ‡ reule of werkes and dedes 
and also for iusticia 
is a passyng cler vertue 
and also for þerby parfit goodnesse is iknowe. 
Þe ferþe, 
þat is semelich to kynges 
and princes of greet malice þat cometh of iniusticia, wrong ‡. 
For as it is iseide in v Ethicorum, 
as he is bettere 
þat is not oonlich good in hymsilf 
but his goodnesse streccheth also to oþere, 
so he is worse 
þat is not onlich euel in hemself, 
but also his malis streccheþ to oþer; 
and to þe mo his malis streccheþ 
þe wors he is þan we. 
So moche þe more besynesse kynges and princes schal studie to kepe 
and holde iusticia 
and voyde iniusticia, wrong, 
þe more euel and harme may come of here iniusticia, wrong, 
and mo men may be greued þerwyþ. It were forþeremore 
to declaryng how kynges and princes may wynne and gete iusticia 
and how he schal kepe and holde iusticia; 
but þat schal be playnlich declared in þe þridde book 
þere it is declared 
how a regne schal be iustliche and riƷtfulliche ireuled. Chapter XIII 
In alle þynge in þe which it happeth to do euel and wel, 
it nedeth to Ʒeue som vertue 
by þe whiche we may be reuled 
in actus and dedes; 
and for in drede 
and in hardinesse 
it happeth a man 
to haue hymself wel and euel, 
it nedeth to Ʒeue 
som vertue in drede and in hardinesse. 
For it happeth þat som men dredeþ 
þat is to dredyng 
and somme dredeþ 
þat it is not to dredynge, 
for som bien so ferful and coward 
þat þei dreden mys 
þat rennen aboute 
and som ben so fole hardy 
þat þei dreden not God 
and þat is not fortitudo, 
but it is wodenes. 
Þerfore it is iwrete, 
primo Magnorum Moralium, 
ho þat is so neuere aferd 
þat he dredeþ not God, 
he is not fortis but wood. 
Þanne to hym 
þat is fortis it longeth to drede what is to drede and be hardy 
whan he schulde be hardy. 
Þanne fortitudo is a vertue 
þat abateþ 
drede and moderateþ hardynesse, 
for fortitudo abateth drede 
þat man withdrawe hym not 
fro þyng þat reson axeth, 
and moderateth hardinesse 
þat man be not hardy 
to auentre vpon thing 
þat is aƷenst resoun. 
For it is declared what is fortitudo, 
it is to wetyng 
in what mater suche a vertue stondeþ. 
Þerfore itis to wetyngeþat properliche forto speke, 
dredeand hardinesse stondeþ in periles; 
for no man dredeþ 
but he wene þat som peril is hym toward, 
noþer is hardy but he auntre 
on som thyng 
þat is dredful and perelous. 
And som peril is in werre and bataille 
and somme cometh of oþere causes; 
for we bien in peril 
not onlich in werre and bataille, 
but also in þe see and in seknesse, 
and in oþere in þe which happeth perilles. 
Also in periles 
þat falleth in werre 
and in bataille 
men hauen hemself diuersliche, 
for som dreden and som bien hardy; 
and hardy | men bien diuerse 
for som auntreth hemself 
liƷtliche to periles of bataile, 
but after þe auentryng 
and þe rees 
þey abiden 
not but taketh to fliƷt and fleeth awey. 
And somme auentreth not liƷtliche 
in to peril of þe batel; 
[but after þe auentryng and þe rees] 
þei abiden and fleen not þe peril of batel. 
Þanne for a vertue stondeþ in good 
þat is wiþ difficulte 
(for periles of werre and bataille 
bien more dredful 
and with more difficulte 
þanne oþere periles, 
and also for in periles of werre and of bataille 
is more difficulte to abate drede 
þan it is to moderate hardynesse, 
also for in dede of hardinesse 
is not so greet difficulte to auentre 
and to rese in to fiƷtynge as it is to abide and fiƷte), fortitudo, 
þat is a vertue 
þat stondeþ in peryles, 
stant more principalliche 
in peril of werre 
and bataille þan in oþere pereles, 
and stondeþ more principaliche 
in abatynge of drede 
þat happeth in suche periles 
þanne in moderatynge of hardines 
þat happeth þerinne. 
And also suche a vertue stondeþ 
more principaliche in abidyng and fiƷtyng þan in auentryng and in rysyng. 
And þat it is more difficulte to abide 
in perel of werre 
and of batelle þan 
in oþere periles 
may be declared by þre weyes. First, 
for suche periles bien more iknowe and more ifeled 
þan oþere periles. 
For we knowen not deþ 
so cleer whan we bien seek, 
for seknesse is ihid withinne, 
noþer we feleþ perel of þe see 
as we doþ perel of werre and of batel, 
noþer we feleth sore hertynge of touche of þe water 
as we doþ of touch of þe swerd. 
Þanne for peril of werre 
and of bataille 
is openliche iknowe, 
and also for it is most ifeled, 
and also we ymageneth and dredeþ 
most sore harm 
and hurtynge in suche perel, 
it is | more difficulte 
and more hard to abyde suche periles þan othere periles. 
Þe seconde, 
it is more hard and difficulte to abyde 
in suche periles 
þan in oþere periles 
not onlich for þey 
ben more openliche iknowe and more greuous hurtyng and sore cometh þerof, 
but also we ymageneth and hopeþ 
to voyde and askape suche periles 
ligtlich by withdrawyng and flight. 
And we may not so voide and fle seknesse. 
For sekenesse is withinne vsself, 
we may not voyde 
ne flee seknesse. 
Noþer we may voyde 
ne flee peril of þe see, 
as we may voyde þe peril of werre and bataille. 
Þan for it is more difficulte to abide peril 
þat we may flee and voyde þan peril 
þat we mot nedes abyde, 
for we may not hem voide and flee, 
here is more difficulte to abide perel of batel 
þan perels of oþere. 
Þe þridde, 
it is more difficulte to abide suche peril 
for þerby we taketh most violent deeþ, 
for deeþ in bataille 
is by maymynge of membris 
and by sore strokes, 
wondes and keruyng of þe body 
by þe whiche we taken most violent deeþ. 
And deþ þat cometh 
by som seeknesse oþere 
by som oþere manere, 
semeth not so contrarie to kynde of þe body 
as deþ of werre and in bataille 
by þe whiche þe body is hakked, 
iwonded and icorue. 
Þanne þe vertue fortitudo ‡ stondeþ principallich in peril of werre and of bataille, 
and by þe consequent and folwyng in oþere periles. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
in iii Ethicorum, 
þat principalliche he is cleped fortis, 
þat is withoute drede 
in good deeþ of werre and in bataille. 
But 3¿t in þe see and in sekenesse he þat is fortis dredeth nouƷt. 
It longeth to hym 
þat is fortis 
to drede no peril 
þat resoun wol þat it is nouƷt to | dredynge. 
But þe most principaliche fortitudo stondeþ 
in peril of werre and of batel 
as in most hard perel 
and with most difficulte. 
Forþermore þey fortitudo stonde 
in dedes 
and in perelles of werre and of bataille 
abatyng drede and moderatyng 
(þat is ‡ [naschyng]) [hardynesse] þerinne, 
Ʒit it stondeþ more principalliche 
in abatyng of drede 
þanne in moderatyng of hardynesse. 
For dredfol perels ben comonliche sorweful, 
and eche man kyndeliche fleeþ 
and voideth thing sorweful, 
as eche man desireth kyndeliche to haue þyng 
þat is likyng. 
Þanne for kyndelich we fleen þyng þat is sorweful, it is hard to abate drede 
by þe whiche we flee thing 
þat is sorweful, 
and is not so hard to moderate hardynesse 
by þe whiche we auentreth and reiseth 
on þyng 
þat is soroufol. 
15 Þerfore Ʒif a vertue stonde principalliche in þyng 
þat is hard with difficultee, 
it is wel iseid 
þat fortitudo stondeþ principalliche more in abatyng of drede þan 
in moderatyng of hardinesse. 
And þat fortitudo stondeþ 
more principalliche 
in abidyng and soffryng þan 
in auntryng and resyng, 
as it is comonliche iseide, 
may by þre weyes be declared. First, 
for auntryng and resyng longeþ to þe strenger 
and bydyng and soffryng 
to þe feblere; 
for he þat reseth is likned to oþere 
as to þe more feble, 
but he þat abideth and soffreth 
as to þe more strong. 
But it is more difficulte to withstonde 
þe more strong 
þan þe more feble. 
Þerfore it is more difficulte 
to abyde and soffry fiƷtynge 
þan it is to rese and falle on fiƷtynge men. 
Þe secunde, 
þat is more difficulte for he 
þat reseth and ymagineth 
to euel and harm haþe euel and harme | 
as it were to comyng, 
but he þat soffreth hath euel and harme present tofore his eyƷen. 
And it is more difficulte to a man 
withstonde and bere hym wel and stalworthliche aƷens his euel and harme 
þat is present 
þan aƷenst euel and harme 
þat is to comynge. 
Þe þridde, 
þat is more difficulte for resyng 
may be do sodeynliche, 
but abydyng and suffryng requireth 
and axeth duryng of tyme. 
Þanne Ʒif it is more difficulte to a man 
to bere hym wel and stedefastliche 
in abidyng and soffryng batel 
þat axeth duryng of tyme, 
þanne in resyng 
þerto þat may sodeynliche be do, 
þerfore, iii Ethicorum, capitulo De Fortitudine, 
þe philosofre seith 
þat fortitudo stondeþ 
in drede and in hardinesse; 
but it stondeth more 
in abatyng of drede 
þan in moderatynge of hardinesse 
and seith þerto 
þat fortitudo stondeþ 
in abidyng and suffraunce of sorweful thinges; 
and so it is declared 
where inne fortitudo stondeþ. 
Þanne it is to declarynge 
how we may make vsself fortes. 
Þerfore it is to wetyng 
þat þei a vertue be contrarie 
to tweyne malice of þe whiche þat oon passeth 
and þat oþer faylleþ, 
as largitas 
(þat is largenesse) 
is contrarie to prodegalitas 
(þat is myspendyng) 
þat passeth in spendyng, and to scarsenesse 
and to chinchery in spendyng; 
and fortitudo is contrarie to audacia 
(þat is hardenesse) 
þat passeth in auntryng 
and in resyng, 
and to timi[d]itas, 
ferfolnesse þat failleþ; 
but alwey a vertue 
is more contrarie to þe oo malice þan to þe oþere. 
As it is more difficulte to abate drede þan to moderate hardinesse, 
fortitudo stondeþ more in abatyng of drede þan in moderatyng | of hardinesse. 
And drede is more contrarie to fortitudo þa[n] is hardynesse. 
Also for we may not fynde euene mene 
and myddel betwene hardynesse and drede, 
we schul raþer drawe to hardinesse þan to drede, 
for hardinesse is lasse contrarie to fortitudo 
þan is drede, 
þerfore we schulde raþer and more decline and drawe to hardynesse 
þan to drede 
Ʒif we wolde make vsself fortes. 
And so thilke þre bien declared 
þat we rekened 
in þe bygynnyng of þis chapitre, 
for it is declared what is fortitudo; 
for it is a vertue 
þat abateþ drede and moderateth hardynesse. 
Also it is declared 
where inne fortitudo stondeþ, 
for it stondeþ principalliche 
in perels of werre and of batail 
and in abatyng of drede 
and in abydyng and sosteyne fiƷtyng; 
and by þe consequent folwyng it stondeth in oþere periles also, 
and in moderatyng of hardinesse 
and in auntryng and resyng on fiƷtyng men. 
Þe þridde, 
it is declared how we may make vsself fortes, 
for þat we doþ in drawyng most to hardinesse 
þan to drede, 
for hardinesse is not so contrarie to fortitudo 
as is drede. Chapter XIV The philosofre, iii Ethicorum, 
capitulo De Fortitudine, 
distingwith seuene maneres of fortitudo. 
Þe firste is fortitudo ciuiles; 
þe secounde, seruilis; 
þe þridde, militaris; 
þe ferþe, furiosa; 
þe fifte, consuetudinalis; 
þe sexte, bestialis; 
þe seuenthe is vertuous fortitudo. Fortitudo ciuilis is whan a man dredeþ schame 
and wol gete worschep 
and auntreth þerfore and reseth 
on som dredful þyng and dede. 
Þerfore þe philosofre seith 
þat in þis manere wise fortes ben acounted most fortes among men 
among þe whiche ferful men 
ben despised 
and fortes iworscheppede. 
| 
And as þe philosofer seith, 
in þis wise Ector was fortus, 
for he dradde to be despised of Polimadas and auntred þerfore and resed 
on dredful dedes and seide 
þat Ʒif he fligh, Polymadas, 
þat was in þe oþer side his aduersarie, 
wolde hym blame and despise. 
Also as þe philosofer seith in þe same wise Dyomades was fortis, 
and seide but Ʒif he dede myƷtiliche and strongliche, 
Ector wolde preyse hymsilf 
among þe Troianes 
and seye 
þat he hath ouercome Diomedes. 
And þis fortitudo 
is wel icleped fortitudo ciuilis, 
for among neighbores and men 
þat knoweth hym 
a man fondeth most to voide velanye 
and despite and desireth 
to haue worschepe. 
For we seeþ 
som þat doþ foule dedes 
whan þei ben in strange 
contre and assaieþ 
no suche dedes among neighbores 
þat he knoweth. 
Þe secounde hatte seruylis 
and is worse 
þan þe firste, 
as whan a man auntreth and reseth to fiƷte, 
nought for to voide and flee velanye and schame noþer 
for to gete worschepe, 
but for drede of peyne oþer compelled by som maner nede. 
In þis wise many of þe Troians dradde Ector 
and were fortes for as þe filosofer seith Ector hadde iordeyned 
þat Ʒif eny of þe Troians 
fliƷ withoute þe bataille, 
he schulde be so arayed 
þat he schulde not be of myƷt 
to dryue awey houndes. 
Dukes of ostes maken men strong 
in þis wise and ordeynen peyne to hym 
þat fleen 
and maken dupe pittes and diches, 
for þe host schulde not flee awey 
but be compelled 
by som necessite and nede to abide and to fiƷte. 
It is iseid 
þat in þis cause 
on compelled his owne ost 
to abide and to fiƷte 
and to be fortis. 
For whan | he was passed in schippes 
with al his ost and com alond, 
for non of his men schulde haue matier 
to flee 
out of his ost, 
he brake alle þe schippes echone. 
Þe þridde hatte fortitudo militaris, 
of knyghthood, 
and þis is fortitudo of assay 
þat þei hauen of werre and of batelle. KnyƷtes aventreth and doþ many dedes 
þat semeth perelous and dredful. 
For as Vegesius seith, 
in libro De Re Militari, 
no man douteth to assaye 
a þyng noþer dede 
þe whiche he troweth and tristeþ 
þat he hath wel ilerned. 
For we seeth þat som men Ʒif he hireth noise 
of rustlyng of armure 
he fleeth anoon 
and conneth not knowe 
what is perilous 
or not perilous in batel; 
but knyƷtes þat bien expert in batel tristeth in here 
awne experience and knoweth perels of batels and reseth and auntreth 
on periles and dredful dedes 
for to be accountted and iholde fortes. 
But þei bien not fortes properliche for to speke, 
for whan þe bateile is so strong 
þat it passeth here experience 
a ‡ turneth þe bak and fleeþ. 
Þe ferþe fortitudo hatte furiosa, wood, 
for by cause of woodnesse 
and of passioun 
som men aventreth som tyme in to strong fiƷtynge so 
þat þei ben [iuged fortes; 
but þei ben] not fortes properliche for to speke 
for verrey fortitudo, 
as þe philosofer meneþ verrey fortitudo, 
auentreth to fiƷtyng not for woodnesse 
but for goodnesse. 
And Ʒif on þat auentreth hym 
to fiƷte for woodnesse, 
Ʒif þei fynden withstondyng and lette, 
þei abyde not to fiƷte; 
for he þat is hardy imaad 
withoute drede by woodnesse, 
whan þe woodnesse is iseced, 
þanne he bygynneth to drede 
and abyde not in batel 
but taken hem to fliƷte. 
Þe fiƷfte fortitudo is consuetudinalis, 
for som men on cas | hauen wel ihapped 
in manye batailes and taketh 
þerfore certeyn hope 
and trist of þe victorie 
by cause of suche customes 
and vsages and taketh 
also certeyn hardinesse and boldenesse 
to fiƷte in batailles. 
Þanne suche bien acounted fortes, 
for þei auntreth hemsilf 
to fiƷte in batailles 
and hauen hope and trist of þe victorie 
and troweth to haue noon harme; 
but þei bien not verrey fortes, 
for Ʒif þei fynden reestes 
and lette and hauen harm 
as þei trowen not, 
þanne þei turnen þe bak and fleen. 
Þe sexte fortitudo hatte bestialis, 
as whan a man knoweth not þe strengthe 
of his aduersarie and fighteth as Ʒif men 
þat woneth in þe norþ bien strong, bolde, and hardy and men 
þat wonen in þe south bien feble and ferful. 
Þan he þat reseth to fiƷte 
with northerne men 
and wenen 
þat þei bien southerne men – men 
þat fiƷten in þat wise hauen fortitudo of bestialis. 
For suche bien vnwise 
as beestes and auntreth 
in to bataille 
and knoweth not þe myƷt 
and þe strengþe of here aduersarie. 
Þe seuenþe hatte fortitudo virtuosa, 
as whanne a man 
is not for constreyned 
noþer for woodnesse 
noþer for experience and assay, 
noþer for vnwarnesse 
and vnkunnynge 
auentreth to fiƷte in bataille, 
but for good and by his owne eleccioun and fre wille. 
And kynges and princes schulde knowe þes seuene maners of fortitudo 
þat [þei] may beknowe 
in what wise here puple is fortis 
and how he may fiƷte with here aduersarie in batel. 
But kynges and princes schulde be fortes 
in vertuous fortitudo 
þat þei put not her puple 
to peril of werre and of bataille, 
but þei haue riƷtful werre and bataille 
and but þei knowe and se 
þat of suche a bataille 
may come greet profite 
to þe contrey and to þe regne. Chapter XV 
Among þe vertues chief and cardinale temporancia 
is þe laste, 
for prudencia and iusticia bien more principal 
þan oþere vertues for prudencia 
is in þe inwit, 
þat hatte intellectus, 
and iusticia in voluntate, 
þat is þe wille. 
And vertues moral bien 
in þe appetite sensitif 
as in þe irascibile, 
þat is wrethful, 
and in þe concupiscible, 
þat is coueitnesse. 
For þe appetite se[n]citif 
is not so worthi 
as þe wille and þe inwit 
þat hatte intellectus. 
Þerfore prudencia and iusticia 
bien most principal vertues. 
And prudencia is more principal þan iusticia, 
for prudencia reuleth alle oþere vertues. 
Alþei fortitudo and temporancia 
be not principal 
as prudencia and iusticia, 
Ʒit þei bien accounted among principal vertues. 
For vertues þat moderateþ passionis serueþ resoun 
in double maner wise, 
as passions ben aƷenst resoun in double manere wise; 
for passiouns ben aƷenst resun 
for þey drawyn vs to do aƷenst resun, 
oþer, 
as it is seyd tofore, 
for he drawyth vs fro dedis 
þat resoun axiþ. 
Amonge þingis þat wiþdrawin vs fro resonable dedes 
is d[r]ede of bateille and periles of deeþ 
and þerin stondeþ fortitudo, 
þat is strengþe. 
Among þynges þat draweth vs to do aƷenst reson ‡is seruice of Venus, 
þat is lecherie and lekyng of tast, 
and þerinne stondeþ temporancia. 
Þanne fortitudo and temporancia bien accounted among principal vertues. 
And fortitudo is more principal þan temporancia, 
for fortitudo is more iordeyned to defense of þe regne 
and to sauacioun of þe contrey. 
And temporancia is more iordeyned to singuler and proper profit 
as to moderacioun of man hymself, 
and comyn profit 
is more worthi þan singuler and proper profit. 
Þanne after þat we haue spoke of prudencia 
þat is more principal 
þan is iusti|cia, 
and of iusticia 
þat is more principal þan fortitudo, 
and of fortitudo 
þat is more principal þan temporancia, 
now it is to spekyng of temporancia 
þat is þe laste amonge þe principal vertues. 
Þanne it is to wetyng 
þat as fortitudo is mene bytwene drede and hardinesse, for he þat dredeþ al thing is not fortis noþer he þat dredeþ no thing, 
but he þat dredeþ 
what is to dredyng 
and is bold and hardy in thinges 
þat he schulde be bold and hardy inne, 
so temporancia is mene bitwene delectacioun and insencibilite. 
And we clepede hym insencibilis, 
agrestis also þat forsaketh and fleeth 
alle bodilich delectacioun and likyng. 
Þanne insencibilitas 
is forsake and fleeth sencible delectacioun 
and likynge more 
þan reson axeth. 
Þanne he þat folweth alle delectacioun 
and likynge is intemporatus 
and he þat forsaketh and fleeth 
al delectacion and likynge 
is icleped insencibilis and agrestis also. 
Þanne he þat fleeth 
þat is to fleyng and folweth 
þat is to folwyng is temporatus; 
for it happeth som tyme to do 
amys not onliche folwynge sencible delectacioun, 
þat is felyng delit and likyng, 
but also forsakyng and fleyng 
suche delectacioun and likyng. 
For who þat wolde so absteyne and spare mete and drynke 
and oþer sencible delectacion and likynge 
þat is kynde myƷte not endure 
with suche abstinens, 
for suche 
abstine[n]s is aƷenst resoun; 
suche oon myƷte nouƷt be cleped vertuous. 
And so it is declared what is temporancia; 
for as fortitudo abateth drede and moderateth (þat is naschyng) hardynesse, 
and is bytwene drede and hardinesse, 
so temporancia abateth sensible delectacioun and likynge 
and moderateth insencibilite 
and is hem bytwene. 
Þanne for temporancia abateth 
sencible delectacioun of likynge, 
it is to wetynge | 
in what sencible delectacioun and likyng stondeþ [temporan]cia. 
For som sencible delectacioun and likyng is strong and som feble 
and som draweth and meueth vs more and some lasse. 
Þei þer be fif wittes, 
Ʒit we hauen strengere likynge in tast 
and in touching þan in siƷte, huryng and smellyng. 
And þat is declared in tweye manere wise. First, for þe more we bien ioned to likynge 
þe more feruent likyng we hauen þerinne. 
And we ben more ioned and nerere to þe likynge 
þat we hauen in tast 
and in touching [þan] to þe likynge 
þat we hauen in oþere wittes. 
For we may hire, 
se and smelle thinges 
þat bien fer from vs, 
but we may not taste and touche but thinges 
þat bien iiuned to vs. 
Þerfore in suche sencible delectacioun we hauen 
þe more feruent likyng. 
Þe seconde, 
þe same is declared, 
for sencible delectacioun in tast 
and in touching semeth iordeyned more strayt and inmediate, 
þat is sone after, 
to oure kepyng and sauacioun. 
To delectacioun in tast is ordeyned 
to kepe and saue þe singuler persone, 
‡ but delectacioun in touching 
as in matrimone is ordeyned 
to kepe, to saue, general and special kynde. 
Þerfore in caas kynde setteþ 
so grete likynge 
in delectacioun in tast 
and in touchyng for syngularite of persones schulde not periche 
and for special kynde schulde be kepte and isaued. 
And so for a vertue stondeþ 
in good and with difficulte, 
temporancia stondeþ 
in þilke delectacioun 
fro þe whiche it is hard and difficulte to absteyne. 
Þanne temporancia stondeþ principalliche 
in delectacioun of oþere wittes, 
þat is so principalliche 
for som tyme it happeth 
þat wit perseyueth thing 
þat is good and likynge in tast and in touching. 
And þe philosofer | wolde, iii Ethicorum, 
suche a vertue stondeþ 
in delectacioun and likynge in þe whiche 
oþere bestes communeth, 
and oþere bestes hauen likynge principalliche in taste 
and in toching 
and al principalliche in oþere wittes. 
Þerfore, iii Ethicorum, 
it is iseid 
þat houndes hauen no ioye of þe smel of þe hare, 
but on þe mete; 
and Ʒif þei hauen ioie of þe smel of þe hare, 
þat is for he troweth and hopeth to ete þerof. 
And þe leoun hath no ioie of þe voice of þe oxe noþer of þe siƷt of þe hert, 
but in so moche as by sight and huyryng 
þey [knoweth] 
þat þei ben neighe and troweth and hopeth to ete þerof. 
Þanne temporancia stondeth 
in delectacioun of tast and of touching, 
but it stondeþ most principalliche 
in delectacioun of touchynge 
for þerinne men hauen most feruent likyng. 
And þat semeth resonable, 
for delectacioun of mete and of dryngke 
þat is in tast 
is ordeyned to kepe and to saue singuler and proper persone; 
but delectacioun of matrymoyne 
þat is in touching 
is ordeyned to getyng 
and gendryng of children 
and to kepe and to saue special kynde. 
Þanne for as it is ofte seide comyn good and profitƷ is bettre þan singuler good and profit, 
it semeth þat kynde doþ resonablelich 
to sette in workes 
and dedes of matrimonye more strong delectacioun þa[n] in workes 
and in dedes of norschyng and of fedyng. 
Oþer in caas kynde doþ so, 
for eueriche man 
is more diligent and besy for his owne good 
and profitƷ þan for good and profit of oþere, 
þanne it nedeth not to sette so strong delectacioun and likyng in mete and in drynke 
þat is ordeyned to singuler good and profit 
and to kepe and saue þe synguler person 
as it nedeþ to sette matrimoyne 
þat is ordeyned to good and profit to oþere 
and kepe and saue special kynde. 
Þan for we schuld most fiƷt aƷenst most hard difficulte, 
‡ þanne | most we schul more byseye 
by temporancia 
to refrayne delectacioun of Venus, 
þat is lecherie, 
þat is in touching, 
þan delectacioun of mete and drynke, 
þat is in taast. 
And Ʒut, 
in delectacioun of mete and drynke 
we haue more lekyng in touchyng þan in tast; 
for in etynge and drynkynge, 
as eche knoweth in hymself, 
we haue likyng in þe tonge 
in þe whiche is þe tast 
and in þe þrote 
in þe whiche is no tast but touchyng. 
And as we knowe oponliche, 
we haueth more lekynge 
whan mete or drynke toucheth þe þrote þan 
whanne it towcheth þe tonge. 
In suche matier þe menyng of glotouns 
is to trowyng and, iii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer reherseth and speketh of on þat heet Philosonus 
þat was so gret glotoun þat he prayede 
þat his þrote schulde be lengere 
þan þe þrote of a crane; 
and prayde not 
þat his tonge schulde be braddere þanne an oxe tonge, 
þat aughte haue more likynge in tast, 
but he preyde 
þat his þrote schulde 
and most be more long 
þan a þrote of a crane 
þat he myƷte in etyng and drynkyng 
haue þe lengere tyme likyng in touche. 
And so by þat is iseid, 
it is declared, 
þat temporancia stondeþ principallich in touche 
and not so principallich in tast 
and Ʒit lasse principalliche in oþere wittes. 
And we may liƷtlyche take diuers maneres of temporancia, 
for it longeth to temporancia 
to refrayne delectacioun and likyng 
þat we hauen in mete and drynke 
and in dedes of lecherie; 
for we abateth and refrayneth delectacioun in mete and drynke 
Ʒif we absteyne and ben sobre, 
and we absteyne delectacioun in lecherie 
Ʒif we ben chast and pudik. 
Þanne þer is foure manere of temporancia: 
sobrietas, abstinencia, castitas and pudicitia. 
For Ʒif we wolleth refrayne delectacioun 
of mete and drynke, 
we | mote make vsself temporate in mete and drynke. 
He þat makeþ hymself temporate 
in drynke is sobrius, 
as he þat passeth in drynke is ebrius, 
and he þat is temporate 
in mete is abstinens. 
And so abstinencia and sobrietas serueth to abate delectacioun 
in mete and drynke; 
but castitas and pudicitia refrayneth delectacioun and likyng of lecherie. 
For he þat is verray temporate 
mote spare workes 
and dedes of lecherie 
and of tast 
and he þat spareth dedes of lecherie 
is icleped castus, chaaste; 
and Ʒif he refrayneth þe passions 
þat exciteþ and meueth to lecherie, 
he is cleped honestus and pudicus also. 
In þes weies it may be sone iknowe 
in what wise we may make vs temporate, for fortitudo and temporancia ben 
as it were aƷeward metyng 
eiþer to oþer; 
for fortitudo stondeþ in auenturyng on dredful dedes, 
but temporancia stondeþ in withdrawyng fram delectacioun and lekyng. 
Þanne as fortitudo accordeth more with hardinesse, 
and Ʒif we wolle be fortes 
we schal be more hardy þan ferful, 
so temporancia acordeþ more with insencibilite. 
Þan Ʒif we wolle make vsselue temporate, 
we schul drawe toward þat party 
so þat we schul be war of sencible delectacioun and likyng; 
for bettre it is to voide and forsake 
som laweful delectacioun and likynge 
þan it is to folwe eny þat is vnlaweful. 
Þanne þe foure bien declared 
þat [bien] porposed 
in þe bygynnyng of þe chapitre. 
For first, 
it is declared what is temporancia, 
for it is a vertue 
þat refrayneth sencible delectacioun and likyng. 
Þe seconde, 
it is declared whare inne temporancia stondeþ, 
for it stondeþ principalich in touch 
and lasse principalliche in tast and lest principalliche in oþere wittes. 
| Þe þridde, 
it is declared whiche 
and how manye maneres ben of temporancia, 
for þei bien foure: 
tweyne moderateth delectacioun and likynge in mete and drynke 
as sobrietas and abstinencia, 
and tweyne refreyneth delectacioun and likynge of lecherie as castitas and honestas 
þat hatte pudesicia also. 
Þe ferþe, 
it is declared hou we may make vsself temporate, 
for þat we doþ most Ʒif we absteyneth and spareth delectacioun and likyng. 
For as þe philosofre seith, ii Ethicorum, 
‡ we schulle do 
as þe olde men of Troye 
dede to Eleyn, 
and seyde, 
“we schal do here awey”: 
þat is to menyng, 
we schal not beholde on here. Chapter XVI The philosofre, iii Ethicorum, 
preueth by foure resons 
þat he is worse 
and more to blame 
þat is intemporate þan he þat is [c]oward and ferfole; 
for þe more wilfulliche 
a man doþ amys, 
þe more he is to blame. 
Also þe more liƷtliche a man may do wel, 
Ʒif he doþ nouƷt, 
þe more he is to blame 
for he mysdoþ 
þe more wilfulliche; 
and also he may more liƷtliche do good 
and gete temporancia 
more liƷtliche þan fortitudo. 
And þat he þat is intemporate doþ 
amys more wilfulliche 
þan he þat is coward and ferefol 
may be declared 
in tweye maner wise. 
First, 
for it is likynge to folwe intemporat wille, 
and it is sorefolle to fle and to drede, 
and a man doþ more wilfulliche what he doþ 
wiþ likynge þan what he doþ with sorwe; 
þan he þat mysdoþ for intemporancia 
doþ more wilfulliche 
þan he þat misdoþ for drede. 
Þe seconde, 
þe same is declared, 
for, 
as þe philosofer seith, 
drede stonyeth 
a man and makeþ 
kynde vnmevable and astonyeth 
and so doþ no likynge þat cometh of intemporancia. 
But whanne a man is astonyed, 
he is | 
as he were out of hymself and doþ 
þat he ne wot what he doþ wilfullich noþer with avisement. 
Þanne he is lasse to blame þat mysdoþ for drede 
þan he þat mysdoth by intemporancia, 
for þat is more wilfollich 
þan þe oþer. 
And so it is declared þat he þat is intemporate 
is more to blame in double manere 
þan he þat is coward and ferfol, 
for he mysdoþ more wilfolliche; 
and so it may be declared in twey manere 
þat he is more to blame 
þat [may] more liƷtliche do wel, 
for more liƷtliche temporancia 
may be gete þan fortitudo. 
For as it is iseide 
in þe nexte chapitre tofore, 
we geteþ and cometh to temporancia 
absteynyng and withdrawyng vsself 
fro sencible delectacioun and likyng; 
but we may gete and come to fortitudo resyng and auntryng on periles dedes and dredful and assayenge gret fiƷtynge and strong. 
And withdrawyng from delectacioun 
and likynge 
may be withoute eny peril. 
But aventuryng in dredful dedes 
in fiƷtynge in bataille 
may not be withoute peril. 
Þanne he is swithe to blame 
þat hath not temporancia, 
for he myƷte come þerto wiþowte peril; 
and he þat is withoute fortitudo 
is not so moche to blame, 
for þat vertue is gete 
with greete difficulte and greet peril. 
Also temporancia may be gete with lasse ‡ 
defficulte þan fortitudo, 
for many thinges we assayeth in oure lif 
þat may be ineme 
to come to temporancia. 
For ofte we cometh to delectacioun 
and likyng in þynges, 
and by abstinence þerfro we bien desposed to be temporate; 
and it is not so of fortitudo, 
for not eche rees in bataille 
makeþ vs fortes 
but þe bataille be rigtfol. 
But in cas al a mannys lif tyme he meteth nouƷt 
with | a riƷtful bataille. 
And so we may not be so 
wel vsed to dedes of fortitudo 
as to dedes of temporancia, 
wherfore it is worse for vs to be intemporate and withoute temporancia 
þan it is to be withoute fortitudo. 
Þanne for a kyng 
þat is not manliche noþer stedfast of herte is to blame, 
it is declared þat he is wors 
and more to blame 
Ʒif he is intemporate and folwynge passions. 
But we may brynge newe resons declarynge 
þat a kyng is to blame Ʒif he is intemporate. 
For, iii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofre toucheth of temporancia 
þre poyntes, 
by þe whiche þre resons 
may be itake 
þat it is most semelich þat princes be temporate. 
For as it is þere itouched, 
intemporancia is a vice most bestial, childelich, foule and veile. 
And þat [it] is a vice most bestial it is declarid. 
For, 
as it is iseide tofor, temporancia and inte[m]porancia stonden in delectacioun and lekyng of touch and tast and haþ delectacioun and lekyng. 
Þerinne [it] is comyn to vs and oþere beestes. 
Þerfore, iii Ethicorum, 
it is iseid 
þat temporancia and intemporancia stonden in dilectacioun and likyng 
in þe whiche oþere bestes communeth with vs. 
Þerfore intemporate men bien seruyle and bestiale. 
A best, 
for a lackeþ wit and vnderstondyng, 
is kyndelich seruyle and serueþ. 
Þanne for it is vnsemeliche to a kyng þat schulde be a lord of oþere 
to be bestial 
and seruyle and seruant, 
it is vnsemelich to hym to be intemporate. 
Þe secunde, intemporancia is a vice most childliche, 
for children þat vsen not reson lyuen not by resoun 
but by passioun. 
Þerfore moste we see hem 
folwe delectacioun (likyng) and passions. 
Þerfore, iii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer likneth þe potencial concupiscible vertue 
in þe whiche is þe vice intemporancia to a child: 
as a child schulde be ruled by | pedage, 
þat is techer and maister, 
so þe potencial concupiscible vertue scholde be reuled by resoun. 
Þanne for it is vnsemelich to a kyng 
to be a child 
in maners 
and not folwe resoun but passions, 
it is vnsemelich to hym to be i[nte]mporate. 
[Þe þridde], 
it is vnsemelich to a kyng to be intemporate, 
for þat vice is most vile and contemtible and despised; 
for intemporate men bien despised 
for þei desiren foule þynges and vile. 
Þerfore Ʒif he be in principate, 
þei bien most despised, 
for eueriche man hath indignacioun of a kyng 
þat is intemporate and folweth not resoun but passions. 
Wherfore Ʒif it is semelich 
to a kynges persone 
to schewe hymself worthi to haue reuerence and worschep, 
it is most vnsemelich 
to hym to be intemporate. 
Suche ensample we hauen of kyng Sardinapallus 
þat was al wommanlich and al intemporate, 
as it is do and seid in olde storiis, 
and wolde not come out 
and speke with barouns and dukes 
of <his> regne. 
But al his talkyng and speche 
was in chambre with wymmen, 
and he sende his lettres to barons and dukes 
what he wolde 
þat thei schulde do. 
And it fil in a tyme 
þat a duk of his oost 
hadde longe iserued hym wel and trewelich, 
and þe kyng in a tyme wolde plese þis duke 
and heet brynge 
þe duk 
in to chambre to hym. 
And þe duk, 
þat was vsed to dedes of werre and of bataille, 
seyƷ þat þis kyng 
was al wommanliche and bestial 
and hadde hym anoun 
in contempt and despite 
and hadde indignacioun 
of his foule doyng 
and wolde haue resed on hym. 
And þe kyng dradde and flee; 
for he trowed not to ascape 
þat dukes hondes, 
he closed hymself 
in an hous 
with al his tresour 
and araye 
of his hous 
and brenneth hymself. 
And we seeþ sencibliche þat þey þat ben intemporate and Ʒeueth | hem to sencible lust and likynge ben contempt and despised, 
for intemporat men doun wrong 
to oþer men in persones and namlich to spousede men 
as in wifes and douƷtres and meueth men aƷenst hymself. 
And for kynges and princes schulde specialiche drede lest woodnesse 
of þe puple ryse aƷenst hem, 
þa[n] it is most spedful 
to hem to be temporate. Chapter XVII 
Tofore bien irekened twelf vertues, 
among þe whiche foure bien principal and cardinal, 
as prudencia, iusticia, fortitudo and temporancia. 
And þanne afterward we hauen ispoke of þes foure vertues, 
and declared how it is semelich 
þat kynges and princes ben ihiƷt 
with þese foure vertues. 
It is furþermore to passe 
and to trete of oþere vertues [þat] stondeþ 
in outward good or in outward euel; 
and outward good is good of itself 
oþer in ordre to oþere. 
Þanne firste we schulle speke of vertues 
þat stondeþ in outward good 
þat is good of itsilf, 
and þerafter of ‡vertues 
þat stondeþ 
in outward euel 
and of‡ vertues 
þat stondeth in outward good in ordre to oþere. 
And outward good is profitable 
(as moneye and richesse 
and al þat may be mesured 
in value be ment, or money) 
oþer it is honest. 
Þanne first we schal speke of vertues 
þat stondeþ in profitable good, 
and afterward of vertues 
þat stondeþ in honest good. 
And for oure knowleche cometh 
[fro] sencible wit, 
þanne for profitable good 
is more sencible þan honest good, 
raþer it is to tretyng of vertues 
þat stondeþ in profitable good. 
And as it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
in profitable good stonden twey vertues: liberalitas and magnificencia. 
Þes twey vertue stonden 
in spence 
in cost and in money, 
but not in þe same | wise. 
For liberalitas þat hatte largitas also stondeþ 
in mene spence and cost, 
but magnificencia stondeþ 
in greet spence and cost. 
And how it schal be vnderstonde, 
it schal be declared in þe processe. 
Þanne for in spendyng it happeth to faille 
and to lacke 
and þat makeþ auaricia (chyncherie), 
and it happeth also to make to greet cost and spence 
and þat maketh prodegalitas (passyng and fool spendyng), 
for eyþer is aƷenst riƷt reule of resoun it 
nedeth to haue som mene vertue 
bytwene auaricia and prodegalitas, 
and þat vertue is liberalitas. 
And so it is declared whaat is liberalitas. 
For as fortitudo 
þat is mene bytwene drede and hardinesse 
is þerfore 
a vertue abatyng drede 
and moderatyng hardinesse, 
so liberalitas is mene bytwene auaricia and prodegalitas 
and is þerfore 
a vertue abatyng auaricia (chyncherie and scarsete) 
and moderatyng prodygalitas (passyng and vnwis spendyng). 
And suche a vertue stondeþ 
in riƷtful vse of moneye, 
and to riƷtful vse of money 
nedeþ þre thinges: first, 
þat it be not fonge 
where it scholde not; 
þe seconde, 
þat it be fonge 
where it schulde; 
þe þridde, 
þat it be spendid 
as it scholde. 
For it longeth to hym 
þat is liberalis not byneme 
oþere men rentes 
and kepe his owne. 
For þei liberalis loue not moneye for itsilf, 
but for to spende it þeweliche, 
he schal not his owne rentes 
mysspende and waste in veyne. 
Þanne he schal not byneme 
oþere menne rentes, 
but he schal kepe wel his owne 
and make þerof resonable cost and spence. 
Þes bien þe þre 
in þe whiche it semeth 
þat liberalitas stondeþ. 
And liberalitas stondeþ not principalich in þes <þre>, 
for it stondeþ principalich 
in þew spence 
and cost and stondeþ 
in kepyng of his owne rentes and nouƷt benemynge | 
oþere men rentes by consequent and folwyng. 
For he þat bynemeth profitable good 
and fongeth it not 
as he schulde sem[eth] coueytous to haue moneye. 
Þerfore, iiii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer seith þat vsurers, 
and baudes þat leuen by horedom, 
and þei þat spoyleƷ dede men, 
and hasardes, 
leuen by foule wynnyng. 
And he clepeþ 
alle suche illeberales, 
for ech hasardour and dees playere is illiberalis, 
for he wynneth of his owne frendes to þe whiche he schulde do good. 
Þanne liberalitas stondeþ 
in not fongyng 
what he schulde not fonge; 
but it stondeþ not principaliche þerinne. For þei þat fongeþ 
what þei scholde not fonge bien more verreyliche icleped iniusti, vnriƷtfol, þanne illeberalis, chynches, 
as þe philosofer meneth, iiii Ethicorum. 
Wherfore liberalitas stondeþ not principalliche in nouƷt takynge 
what he schulde not take, 
noþer in takyng 
what he schulde take, 
but it stondeþ principalliche in spendyng 
as he schulde spende. 
For euerich þyng is for som what and þat is more principale. 
Þan for liberalis kepeth 
and saueth his awne rente, 
and takeþ what he schulde, 
and doþ it for he wolde 
of his owne rente 
make his owne cost 
and þew cost, 
[and] spende as it is semelich, 
þanne it is worthi to saye 
þat liberalitas stondeþ 
most principalliche in spendyng 
and in doyng good to oþere. 
And by þe consequent folwyng, 
it stondeþ in kepyng 
and sauyng his awne rente 
and also in nouƷt benemyng of oþer men rente. 
For, iiii Ethicorum, 
by fyue resons þe philosofer 
preueth þat liberalitas stondeþ more principalliche in spendyng 
and in doyng good to oþere þanne in kepyng and sauyng of his owne rente. 
For, 
as it is iseide, liberalitas stondeþ 
in þew vse of money; 
and þew vse of money [is] Ʒeuyng money | to oþere men. 
And kepyng and sauynge of his owne rente, 
it is not vsyng of moneye 
but it is more verreyliche †gaderyng† 
and getyng of money. 
Þerfore it is cleer þat liberalitas ‡ stondeþ more in spendyng 
and in Ʒeuyng money to oþere þan it doþ 
in kepyng and sauyng 
of his owne rente. 
Þe seconde, 
þe same is declared, 
for it longeth to a vertue 
to do þe more good, 
and it is more good to do wel þan to soffry wel 
and to worche wel 
þan not do foule dedes. 
And he þat spendeþ wel and Ʒeueth good to oþere doþ wel, 
and he þat takeþ his owne rente and money of his owne possessioun suffreþ wel 
oþere fongeþ wel, 
for he doþ as he scholde. 
And he þat bynemeth not oþere menne good doþ not vile dedes. 
Þanne Ʒif it is bettere to do wel 
þa[n] not to do euel 
oþere soffre wel, 
bettre it is to spende wel 
þan not 
byne[m]e oþere men good oþere kepe wel his owne. 
Þe þridde, 
same is declared, 
for a vertue stondeþ 
most principalliche in þyng þat most preysyng stondeþ; 
[and most presyng stondeþ] 
in spendyng wel and in doynge good to oþere þan 
in kepyng of his owne 
[oþer not] 
byne[m]yng oþer menne good. 
Þanne liberalitas stondeþ most principalliche 
in þew spendyng 
and in doynge good to oþere. 
Þe ferþe, 
þe same is declared, 
for a vertue stondeþ more principalliche 
in þe most difficulte, 
and it is more difficulte to Ʒeue Ʒiftes 
to oþere men 
þanne it is to kepe 
and saue his owne rente oþer not to byneme oþer menne good. 
For in kepyng and sauyng 
of his owne good 
is no difficulte of itself, 
for eche man is kyndelich inclined 
to loue hymself and to kepe and saue his owne good and catel. 
But in Ʒeuyng of his owne good 
to oþere men is difficulte of itsilf, 
for oure owne good and catel perteyneth | 
to vssilf and we loueþ 
kyndeliche oure good and catel. 
So þat coueytous men and chynches louen 
so moche outward good and catel so 
þat þei holden and acounten money 
þat þei hauen incomporate to hemsilf, 
for it semeth to hem 
þat whan money is itake of hem 
þat som what of here owne body 
is itake of hem. 
Þanne for oure awne good 
is as it were iuned to vs, 
it is not so greet difficulte to not byneme oþere menne good, 
þe whiche good we loueth nouƷt noþer bien iiuned þerto, 
as it is to Ʒeue oure owne good 
þat we louen more 
for it is iuned ‡ to vs. 
Wherfore in þew spendyng 
and in Ʒeuyng good to oþere, 
liberalitas stondeþ most principalliche 
as in þe most difficultee. 
Þe fifte, 
þe same is declared, 
for liberal men bien most iloued. 
For liberalitas stondeþ most in doyng 
for þe whiche a man is most iloued. 
And a man is not most iloued 
for he benemeþ not oþer menne good noþer 
for a kepeth wel his owne, 
but he is most iloued 
Ʒif he spendeþ wel and þewlich his owne rentes 
and Ʒeueth grete Ʒiftes to hem 
þat bien good and worthi. 
Wherfore in wel spendyng 
and Ʒeuyng good to oþere men liberalitas stondeþ principalliche. 
And so it is declared 
what is liberalitas: 
for it is a vertue abatyng malice 
as coueitise and chincherie 
and moderatynge prodigalite, 
passyng and vnwis spendyng. 
And it is declared where liberalitas stondeþ, 
for it stondeþ principalliche 
in þew spendyng and cost and resonable; 
by þe consequent folwyng, 
it stondeþ in kepyng of his owne rentes 
and in nouƷt benemyng 
oþere menne goodes. 
It may liƷtliche be ischewed 
how we may make | vsself liberales; 
for as fortitudo 
is more contrarie to drede þan to hardynesse, 
þerfore we maken vsself hardy drawyng more to audacia 
so þat we be more hardy 
þan lesse hardy; 
so for liberalitas 
is more contrarie to auaricia, chyncherye, 
þan to prodegalite, 
we schul more drawe to prodigalite þan to auaricia. 
Þat is to menyng, 
we schal raþer Ʒeue to moche þan to lite. Chapter XVIII The philosofer, iiii Ethicorum, 
wol mene þat liberalitas stondeþ 
not in multitude of Ʒiftes 
but in þe habite and faculte and wille of þe Ʒeuere. 
For as it is þere iseid, 
ofte he þat Ʒeueþ leste Ʒiftes 
is most liberal Ʒif he Ʒiueth of lite. 
Þanne liberalitas takeþ mesure of þe proporcioun of Ʒiftes 
to þe possessioun of þe Ʒeuere. 
Þerfore þe philosofer seith 
þat a tyrant 
is not prodegus 
for it semeth 
þat he may not in Ʒiftes 
and in cost passe 
þe multitude 
of his possessioun and hauyng. 
Þanne he þat haþ and fongeth 
as muche as he Ʒeueth and spendeþ, [and] passeþ not þe Ʒiftes 
in multitude of his posscessioun, 
in som wise for to speke 
may not be prodegus. 
Þanne for kynges and princes 
hauen greet and passynge plente of possessioun, 
not oonliche they mow not be prodegi, 
but vnneþe they mowe recche to be liberales. 
Þanne for þey schulle alwey 
thenke 
þat he doþ lasse þanne 
it is semelich þerby, 
it may be seye hou vnsemelich 
it is to hem to be auary and chynches; 
for Ʒif þe regne of a man 
schal be kyndelich regne, 
it schal be likned to þynges 
þat we seeþ in kynde. For in kynde is no thing 
an idel as philosofres menen. 
Þanne noþer in rewlyng of þe lyf of mankynde schulde ouƷt be an idel. 
For mankynde is content with luyte good [þat] suffiseth to oon | persone, 
Ʒif eny oo persone 
hath passynge moche good and riches, 
þat good is idel 
and þat richesse Ʒif 
it is not ordeyned to good profitƷ of oþere men. 
Þanne þe more good and richesse kynges and princes hauen, 
þe worse þei bien and þe more 
de[t]e[s]table Ʒif þey ben auari and chinches. 
iiii Ethicorum, 
by þre resouns þe philosofer 
preueth þat auaricia, chyncherie, 
is worse þan prodegalitas. 
Þerfore it is fol detestable Ʒif kynges and princes bien auari. 
For kynges and princes schulde forsake and voide auari[ci]a, 
þat he schulde Ʒif it 
myƷte be be raþer prodigi þan auari, 
for it were bettre 
þat þey were prodigi þan auari. First, 
for it is bettre to haue a iuel 
as it is curable 
þan an iuel 
þat is not curable, 
and prodigalitas is an iuel 
þat is curable specialliche in age. 
For þey þat bien prodigi in Ʒouþe 
may be auari in elde; 
for comunlich olde men ben more auari and chynches þan Ʒonge men, 
and comunlich whanne þey comen to elde here 
prodegalitas passeþ 
and þei leueþ to be prodigi. 
Also prodegalitas is curable by nede, 
for comonliche þei 
þat bien prodigi bien nedy 
for þei hauen greet rente. 
Þanne þei assayeth defaute and nede, 
and becometh not prodigi. 
Þanne, 
as þe philosofer meneth, 
prodegalitas is an yuel 
þat is curabel 
by age othere by nede. 
And auaricia is an yuel 
þat is not curabel, 
for þe more a man passeth in auaricia, 
and þe more he draweth to elde, 
þe more auarus and chynche he is. 
Þanne Ʒif it is vnsemelich 
þat þe heed of þe regne, 
þat schulde rewle al þe regne, 
schuld in þewes haue a euel 
þat is incurabel, 
it is fol detestabel 
to a kyng to be auarus, 
for it is knowe 
þat it were bettre 
þat he were prodegus þan auarus. 
Þe seconde, 
þe same is declared, 
for prodegalitas is more nyƷe 
to | vertue þan auaricia, 
for liberalis fongeþ not gladliche 
and Ʒeueth gladliche, 
and prodegus also doþ bothe and auarus doþ neuer noþer. 
Þanne prodegalitas and liberalitas bien not diuerse, 
but for prodigus Ʒeueth nouƷt 
as he schulde 
and to wham he schulde; wherfore, 
for prodigus loueþ not money noþer liberalis, 
he þat is prodegus 
may sone be liberalis. 
Þanne Ʒif it is semelich in alle wise 
þat a kyng be vertuous 
in so moche as auaricia 
is more contrarie to vertue 
þan is prodegalitas, 
it is worse 
þat a kyng be auarus þan prodegus. 
Þe þridde, 
it is detestable, 
for a kyng is sette in þe regne for sauacioun þerof 
and for to profite to hem 
þat bien þerinne; 
and he þat is auarus profiteth to no man, 
for he is also euel to hymself 
and he þat is prodegus profiteth to many men. 
Þanne in alle wise it is detestable Ʒif a kyng is auarus. 
For it is declared 
þat it is as þei 
it were inpossible 
þat kynges be prodigi 
and þat it is in al wise detestable Ʒif kynges bien auari, 
it is to declaryng 
þat it is semelich 
for hem to be large, liberal and communycatif; 
for þis vertue þat stondeþ 
in spendyng and cost is 
by a certeyn similitude, 
aliknesse, icleped largitas, liberalitas, and communicabilitas, 
and is cleped largitas 
bi liknes of vessel. 
For vessel with strait mouth and narwe Ʒeueþ not largeliche what is þerinne in greet plentee. 
Þerfore in spendynge and Ʒiftes a man 
is cleped largus 
for he Ʒeueth largeliche 
þat he hath as a vessel wiþ large mouth. 
Þe moo mote haue water of a welle, 
þe more large mote 
þe mouþ þerof be, 
so þe moo moste haue influens 
and help of þe kyng 
þan of oþere men, 
so moche þe more large and liberal 
þe kyng mot be. 
Þe secunde, 
þis vertue hatte liberalitas for þei 
þat bien liberal hauen | 
þe liknesse of fre men; 
and auari bien not fre, 
but þey bien bonde and seruantes to moneye. 
Wherfore Ʒif it is vnsemeliche to kynges and princes 
to be seruantes and bonde, 
it is conuenient and semelich to hem 
to be liberal and large. 
Þe þridde, 
þis vertue is icleped communicabilitas, 
for þerby men ‡ communeþ here good and catel 
for þe whiche communicacioun 
þei ben most loued of oþer men, 
for þei þat ben liberal and large beth most iloued. 
Wherefore Ʒif it is most semelich 
þat kynges and princes be iloued of hem 
þat ben in þe regne, 
it is most semelich 
þat þei ben liberal and large. 
It langiþ to hym þat is liberal, first, to take hede hou moche h[e] Ʒiuiþ 
þat he Ʒiue not more noþer lasse þan he schulde. 
Þe secunde, 
he schal take hede to wham he Ʒeueth 
þat he Ʒeue to hem not 
þat he schulde not Ʒeue. 
Þe þridde, 
he schal take hede wherfore he Ʒeueth 
þat he may Ʒeue for good 
and for non oþer cause. 
For kynges and princes may vnnethe faile of þe wey of liberalite 
in Ʒeuyng more þan he schulde, 
for gret spence and Ʒiftes may vnneþe passe þe multitude of rentes. 
And Ʒif it happeth þat a liberal man Ʒeueþ more þan he schulde, 
he is moderatliche sory, 
as þe philosofer wol mene, 
for it greueth more a liberal man 
Ʒif he Ʒeueth lasse þan he schulde 
or Ʒif he spendeþ not 
where it nedeþ þanne it greueth hym Ʒif he spendeþ whare it nedeþ nouƷt. 
And kynges and princes faillen 
of þe wey of liberalite 
in Ʒeuyng 
to hem it nedeth not, 
oþer wharfore it nedeþ not, 
for þei Ʒeueþ, 
as þe philosofer seith, 
to mynstrelles and to flaterers 
and to oþere to wham it nedeþ not, 
for it were more semelich 
þat suche be pore þan riche. 
Also þey Ʒeuen wherfore it nedeþ not for þei Ʒeueth not for good bot more for to be preysed 
and for veyn glorie oþer for som oþer cause. 
Þanne it is | semelich 
þat kynges be liberal, 
[and for to be liberal] 
hem nedeþ to do good to hem 
þat bien good and bi cause 
þat þei ben good. Chapter XIX 
Hit is iseid tofore 
þat þer bien twey vertues of þe whiche on stondeþ 
in moderat spendyng and cost 
and hatte liberalitas, 
and oþere stondeþ in greet spendyng and cost and hatte magnificencia. 
Bote for more and lasse maketh not diuers special kynde of þynges 
as þe philosofer meneþ, primo Poleticorum, 
it semeth not þat liberalitas and magnificencia 
bien sufficientliche distyngwed 
by þat þat þe on stondeþ 
in passyng gret spendyng and coost 
and [þ]e oþere in mene spendynge and cost. 
Þerfore it is to wetynge 
þat by resoun and kynde a vertue stondeth 
in good and difficulte. 
Þanne for in gret spendyng and cost 
is special resoun of goodnesse and difficulte 
þat is not in mene spendyng and cost, 
þerfore magnificencia 
þat stondeþ 
in greet spendyng and cost schal be cleped anoþer vertue. 
Þanne he hatte liberalitas 
þat stondeþ in mene spendyng and cost. 
Oþer we may saye 
þat spendyng and cost may haue ‡ comparisoun to tweyne: 
to his faculte þat makeþ spendyng and cost; 
to þe workes and dedes 
in þe whiche he maketh spendyng and cost. 
Þanne in spendyng and cost of 
m[o]ny stondeþ twey vertues: 
on þat [euen]eth Ʒiftes and cost and spendyng 
to his faculte and richesse 
(þat makeþ spendyng and cost), 
and þis hatte liberalitas. 
Þerfore it is iseid 
þat liberalitas stondeþ 
in mene spendyng and cost 
and not by þe selue cost but by comparisoun to hym 
þat makeþ spendyng and cost. 
Þerfore a man myƷte Ʒeue grete Ʒiftes and moneye and be auarus and chynche Ʒif þilke Ʒiftes 
were not ieuened 
to his faculte and richesse 
þat Ʒeueth þilke | Ʒiftes. 
For it is seid tofore, liberalitas stondeþ 
not in many Ʒiftes and grete, 
but he þat is liberalis 
eueneþ his spendyng and cost 
to his owne faculte and richesse. 
But magnificus wol euene his spendyng 
and cost 
to þe workes 
þat he makeþ. 
Þerfore þe vertue magnificencia 
hath þe name of workes 
and of facio, makynge. 
Magnificus is cleped as it were magna faciens, 
makynge and doynge grete thinges. 
And þerfore it is þat 
in what gree euere a man be 
and what faculte and richesse 
euer he haue, 
lite oþer moche, 
it is difficulte to vse þe richesse wel 
and to euene wel 
þe spendynge and cost 
to þe faculte 
and to þe richesse. 
Þerfore liberalitas stondeþ 
in 
me[ne] spendyng and cost. 
For spendyng and cost 
is acounted moche oþer lite in itself 
oþer in comparison to þe faculte and richesse. 
And for to acounte spendyng and cost gret oþer lite in itself, 
so liberalitas stondeþ in gret spendyng and cost Ʒif he [þat] doþ þe spendyng and cost haþ 
gret faculte and riches, 
and in m[ene] spendyng and cost Ʒif he 
þat doþ þe spendyng and cost haue but mene faculte and riches. 
But Ʒif þe despendyng and cost is 
gret oþer litel not in itself 
but in þe comparisoun 
to þe faculte and richesse, 
[þanne liberalitas is alwey 
in mene spendyng and cost. 
For as litel spendyng and cost is mene in comparisoun to þe pore, 
so gret spendyng and cost is mene in comparisoun to riche men. 
Þanne for liberalitas stondeþ in spendyng and cost not in itself, 
but in comparisoun to þe faculte and 
richesse,] þanne þe spendyng and cost 
is not acountted mene and gret, 
but onliche mene. 
Þanne liberalitas 
þat stondeþ 
in spendyng and cost proporcionate to faculte and richesse streccheth to al faculte and richesse; 
and so for in mene faculte and richesse 
is difficulte a man to haue hymself wel þerinne. 
And magnificencia stondeþ 
in spendyng and cost semlich to workes 
and not in alle workes and dedes, 
for it is not difficulte to make semelich spendyng and cost [in] al maner workes and dedes 
but onliche in grete workes | and dedes. 
Þerfore magnificencia 
hath þe name of magnis factoribus 
and magnis operibus, 
grete makers and grete workes. 
And in grete workes 
it happeth to faile 
for som man setteþ 
not his entent 
how he may make grete workes, 
but how litel he may spende 
and suche oon 
is icleped paruificus; 
and som spendeþ 
in suche workes more þan it nedeþ 
to spende in suche workes 
and suche on is icleped consumptor, 
a wastour. 
And þe philosofer clepeth suche on bonausus, 
fyre and fomax, 
an ouene oþer fomeys, 
for suche oon consumeth and wasteþ 
as an ouen. Andsomme ingrete workes maken resonable spendyng and cost and suche oon 
is vertuous and icleped magnificus. 
Þanne magnificencia is mene bitwene paruificencia and consumpcio, wastyng, 
as liberalitas is mene bytwene auaricia and prodegalitas. 
Þanne it is declared what is magnificencia. 
For as liberalitas abateþ 
auaricia and moderateth prodigalitas, 
so magnificencia abateþ paruificencia 
and moderateþ consumpcion, wastyng; 
and as liberalitas makeþ spendyng and cost proporcionate 
to faculte and richesse, 
so magnificencia maketh spendyng 
and cost proporcionat to grete workes. 
But for it is declared 
what is magnificencia, 
it is to wetynge 
where inne it stondeþ; 
for as it longeth to þis doyng, 
man hath comparisoun to foure: to God, 
to al þe comynte, 
to certeyn special persones, 
and to hymself. 
Touching al þese, 
magnificus schal haue hymself wel and semelich; 
but he schal not sette his entent 
[illiche principalliche in alle þese, 
for firste man schal be magnificus 
in ordeynyng of Go<d>des seruice 
Ʒif his faculte and richesse telleþ þerto 
and he schal make grete temples 
and worschepful sacrefice and worthi array. 
Þerfore, | iiii Ethicorum, 
it is iseid 
þat þe worschepful spendyng 
and cost 
þat magnificus schal make 
and do schal be do 
in þe worschep of God. Þe secunde, 
it longeth to hym þat is magnificus 
Ʒif he hath wherewith to make semelich spendyng and cost in al þe comynte, 
for þe comyn good 
and catel longeth 
in som wise to God. 
Þerfore þe philosofer seith 
þat comyn good and catel is som what iliche to gode 
þat is halwed to God, 
for Goddis good is forsympelliche represented 
in oon singuler persone 
and schineth ful faire in al þe comynte. 
Þe þridde, 
magnificus schal haue hymself semelich 
to a certeyn special persone 
as to persones 
þat ben worthi worschep, 
for in þat is magnificencia ‡ most ischewed whan a man doth good to hem that ben worthye. 
[Þe ferþe], 
magnificus schal haue hymsilf semliche 
touchinge his owne persone, 
for he schal haue hemself swythe manliche 
in grete workes touchyng his owne persone; 
and gret workes may be clepid workes 
þat dureþ al a manis lif tyme, 
as hous and grete boldes, 
oþer workes 
þat ben selde ido 
in a mannes lif tyme, 
as festes of mariage and of weddyng and of knyƷthode. 
And it is semelich to hym 
as it is seid, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
to araye semlich wonyng place, 
for he schal sette his entent more how he schal make wonderful hous 
and longe duryng þanne 
how he may make faire hous 
in siƷt and vntristi. 
Also it is semelich to hym þat is magnificus 
to make grete and solempne festes of mariage 
and of weddyng 
and of knyƷthode 
and of oþere suche 
þat falleth but selde. 
And so it is declared 
what is magnificencia 
and where inne it stondeþ, 
for it stondeþ 
in greet spendyng 
and cost in greet workes. 
But it stondeþ principaliche 
in greet spendyng 
and cost in seruice and worschep of God, 
and al þe comynte. 
And by þe consequent folwynge it | stondeþ 
in greet spendyng 
and cost in worthi persones, 
and in himsilf also. 
For it is declared 
what is magnificencia 
and where inne it stondeþ, 
it may sone be som del yknowe 
how a man may make hymsilf magnificus, 
for as liberalitas 
is more contrarie to auaricia 
þan to prodigalitas, 
so magnificencia is more contrarie to paruificencia 
þan to consumpcio, wastyng. 
Ʒif he hath wherwith, 
a man schal make hymself magnificus, 
drawyng to consumpcio, wastyng, 
so þat he make in grete workes rather to moche spendyng 
and cost þan to liƷte. Chapter XX The philosofer, iiii Ethicorum, 
toucheþ sex propertees of hym 
þat is paruificus, 
cheef negon and chinche, 
þat were most aƷenst kynges and princes Ʒif þei hadde þilke sexe propretees. 
Þe firste proprete [is] 
for in al dedes 
and doyng he failleþ 
and is to scarse, 
and þat is iknowe 
by þe name paruificus, 
for he hath þe name of paruificus, 
of makynge litel dedes 
with defaute and scarste. 
Þe seconde properte is for sif it happeth 
þat paruificus 
doþ grete dedes, 
he leseþ moche good for to saue a lite. 
Þerfore it is iseid in a prouerbe þat vile men leseþ and spilleþ festes of mariage and weddyng 
for an ey5 worth of peper; 
for whan a maketh not semelich cost and spendyng 
in a greet feste, 
þei wollen spare a litel cost 
and schendeþ al þe feste. 
Þe þridde, 
paruificus doþ late al þat he doþ, 
for hym semeth as greuous to do awey money 
as to kette or kerue me[m]bris of his owne body. 
Þerfore as Ʒif a man neded 
to be maymed oþer ikorue, 
he wol tarie þat maymyng and keruyng 
and putte it of as longe as he myƷte. Þ[e ferþ]e, his entent is not how he may make grete workes, 
as how he may make and Ʒeue gret Ʒiftes, 
noþer how he may make festes of mariage, 
| but al his entent 
is how he may make liƷt spendyng and cost. 
For it is his proprete 
to telle more pris of moneye 
þan of grete workes. 
Þanne he is more besy and castynge 
how he may spende liƷt þan 
how he may make grete workes. 
His fifþe properte, 
alwey to spende wiþ care 
and þynkyng and sorwe. 
For it is iseid 
þat paruificus acounteþ outward good and catel þat he hath 
as it were incomporate to hymsilf 
and as it were pertinent 
to his awne substance. 
And for he loueth his catel 
so and so continewith hymsilf þerto, 
þerfore as in keruynge of body 
(of departyng of continual parties) 
comeþ wo and sorwe, 
so in departyng of money, 
þat is by spendyng and cost, 
for þer is as it were departynge of continual parties; 
for paruificus acounteþ his money 
as it were incomporate 
and continuede to hymself. 
Þerfore he may not spende 
and do away his money 
withoute wo and sorwe. 
And in þis paruificus accordeþ with auarus, 
for euerich paruificus is auarus 
as eche magnificus is liberalis. 
Þe sixte, 
þei paruificus doþ nouƷt, 
hym semeth alwey 
þat he doþ more þan he doþ 
oþer schulde for it is iseid 
þat paruificus telleþ more pris of moneye 
þan of Ʒiftes and cost 
þat ben workes of vertues. 
For þei acounteþ money 
ful lef and derworth, 
and werkes of vertues 
þei accounten vile and tellen no pris þerof. 
Þanne for vnneþe 
a man may Ʒeue so litel of þing 
þat is leef 
and dere for þyng 
þat is vile 
but it seme hym þat he Ʒeueth more þan he schulde, 
for paruificus may not spende so lite 
in what werk euere it be, 
hym semeth alwey 
þat he spendeþ 
more þan he schulde. 
Wherfore Ʒif it is shame 
for a kyng 
to be scarce and faille in alle dedes; 
and to lese moche good for lyte; 
and alwey to tarye 
and do no þyng sone 
and with good wille; 
and neuere | sette his entent 
to make 
and do grete workes and vertues, 
but how he may spende litel 
and alwey spende aƷenst herte 
and with wo and wiþ sorwe; 
and whanne [he] doþ not, wene þat he makeþ grete workes: 
for alle þes ben vile and ben aƷenst þe kynges maieste, 
in alle wise it is shame 
to a kyng to be paruificus. 
And þat it is semelich 
for a kyng to be magnificus 
it is preued tofore 
atte þe fulle, 
þer we declared wherinne magnificencia stondeþ. 
[For it is iseid 
þat magnificencia stondeþ] principallich 
as in seruice and worschep of God 
and in þe comynte, 
and by þe consequent folwyng in worthi persones 
and in hymself also. 
Þanne for a kyng is heed of þe regne and commyne and worschepful and reuerent persone, 
and to hym it longeþ to Ʒeue, 
departe and dele þe good of þe regne, 
it is most semelich 
þat he be magnificus. 
For he is heed of þe regne 
and þerby he hath þe liknesse of God 
þat is heed and prince of alle, 
it is most semelich 
þat he bere hymsilf 
as magnificus schulde in makyng holy temples 
and ordinaunce and araye of seruice and worschip of God. 
And for he is a comune persone 
to þe whiche al þe comynte 
is ordeyned 
and al þe regne, 
it is most semelich to hym to bere hymself as magnificus schulde in þe departyng and delyng 
þe comyn good and catel and in þinges 
þat longeth to al þe regne. 
Also for to hym it longeth most to departe and dele þe good 
and catel of þe regne in alle wise, 
it is most semelich to hym to haue hymself 
as magnificus schulde to worþy persones 
to þe whiche 
þat good and catel longeþ worthiliche. 
Also for it is iseid 
þat a kynges persone is reuerent and worthi worschepe, 
it longeth to a kyng to haue hymself 
as magnificus schulde 
to his owne persone 
and to oþer | persones þat bien aboute hym 
as to his wif and children 
and oþere maynye; 
hauyng worschepful place to dwelle inne; 
and makyng semelich festes of mariage; 
and drawynge to hym wonderfullich cheualrie. Chapter XXI The philosofre, iiii Ethicorum, 
capitulo De Magnificencia, 
toucheth sex propretees of hym 
þat is magnificus, 
þe whiche nedeth kynges and princes to haue. 
Þe firste, magnificus oweþ 
to haue wisdam 
and connyng for it is seid 
þat it longeþ to hym in gret workes tomake semelichspendyng and cost, 
and he may not knowe spendyng and cost accordyng to grete workes but Ʒif he be wys and connynge. 
Þe secunde proprete 
is to make gret spendyng and cost 
þat he affende not hymself 
but þat mot be for good ende; 
for it is comyn to eche vertue to wirche and doo not for fauour noþer 
for bost and preisyng among men, 
but by cause of good ende. 
But specialliche þat is a properte of magnificencia; 
for in gret workes of magnificencia, 
[a]s whan a man hath hymsilf 
as magnificus 
in seruice and worschep of God 
and to þe comyn profit 
and to worthi persones 
þanne he semeth most glorious and is most ipreysed among men, 
þanne it is hard in suche dedes 
and doynge not desire preysyng of men. 
And for a vertue stondeþ 
in good and in difficulte, 
þerfore it longeþ 
most to hym 
þat is magnificus 
in his grete workes 
and Ʒiftes 
to sette his entent in good ende 
and not on fauoure 
and veyn glorie 
and praysyng of men. 
His þridde proprete 
is to make spendyng, cost, 
and Ʒeue Ʒiftes sone 
and wiþ likynge. 
For he þat acounteþ and rekeneth, 
or he Ʒeue Ʒiftes smale spendyng and cost, 
and Ʒeueþ not sone and wiþ likynge what | he schulde Ʒeue, 
is not magnificus bote paruificus. 
Þerfore, iiii Ethicorum, 
it is iseid 
þat besinesse of acountyng 
and rekenyng is paruifica. 
Þe ferþe properte 
is to sette his entent more 
how he may make gret werk best 
and most semlich þan 
to wite and knowe 
how gret spendyng 
and cost nedeþ to þat werk. 
As Ʒif magnificus schal make a temple 
in worschep of God 
or Ʒeue eny Ʒiftes to worthi persones, 
he schal sette his entent more 
how he may make þat temple 
wonderfol and faire 
and how Ʒiftes may be grete and semelich þan to wete and knowe how moche money hym nedeþ 
to spende in suche workes and Ʒiftes. 
Þe fifte proprete 
is þat magnificus is excellentliche liberal, 
for it is al on 
to be magnificus 
and to be excellentliche liberal. 
For, 
as it schal be declared wiþinne, 
magnificencia is a certein perfeccioun 
and a certeyn hiƷtnesse of liberalite, 
as magnanimitas is a certeyn perfeccioun 
and a certeyn heiƷnesse of al vertues. 
Þanne ‡ for he þat makeþ semelich spendyng and cost in grete workes 
is magnificus 
and he þat makeþ semelich spendyng and cost is liberal, 
‡ þan he þat makeþ most semelich spendyng and cost 
as magnificus doþ is most liberal. 
His [s]exte properte 
is to make more solempne werk 
with certeyne spendyng and cost 
þanne paruificus 
with so moche spendyng and cost; 
for paruificus fondeþ alwey 
to spare money and cost, 
as it is iseid tofore, 
and leseth moche for lyte. 
And magnificus, 
for he reccheth not of acountes and rekenyng, 
a maketh with so moche cost 
moche grettere werk 
and more solempne 
for he spareth not spendyng and cost. 
Sum tyme it happeth þat auarus spendeþ more 
in som dede and nede þan liberalis, 
| for alwey auarus fondeþ to withdrawe som semelich spendyng and cost þe[i] þey be litel and smal. 
Þerfore he makeþ þe work vnsemelich 
in þe whiche he makeþ gret cost and spendyng. 
Wherfore with so moche cost for so moche, 
and som tyme with lasse, 
magnificus or liberalis makeþ fairere werk 
and more solempnere þan paruificus or auarus. 
It is not hard to knowe 
þat kynges and princes schulde haue þese condicions and propretees for þey scholde be specialliche wis and konnynge 
and knowe what spendyng and cost nedeþ 
and to whiche workes. 
And to hem it longeth to Ʒeue grete Ʒiftes and to make grete spendyng 
and coste for a good ende; 
and þey scholde sette here 
entent most in good ende 
for þei scholde reule and brynge 
al þe comynte to good ende. 
Also to hem it longeth 
to make spendyng and cost al redy and sone and with likyng. 
For, 
as it is iseide tofore, 
kynde is apaied 
with litel and richesse 
is an ydel and in veyn, 
but þerof be made þewe Ʒiftes and semlich spendyng and cost. 
Þanne þe more faculte and richeise kynges and princes hauen, 
þe more semelich it is for hem to Ʒeue þe more gret reward and Ʒiftes, 
also to spende þe more prestlich and sone wiþ þe more likyng. 
Also it is most semelich for kynges and princes 
to sette here 
entent more to wete 
and to knowe 
how he schal make and do excellent workes 
þanne how þei mowe spare moneye and cost; 
but also it is semelich for hem 
to be excellentliche liberal 
and alwey 
to make grete workes and solempne. 
Þanne it is semelich for kynges and princes 
to haue al þe propretees of magnificus 
most fol and p[ar]fitliche. 
And so, iiii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofre wol mene þat not ech man may be magnificus, 
for not ech man may make gret spendyng | and cost; 
for, 
as it is iseid þere, 
suche mot be gentil men noble and glorious. 
Werfore þe more noble 
a kyng is passyng oþere men, 
þe more semelich it is for hym 
to be magnificus 
and haue propretees of magnificus. Chapter XXII 
As it is iseid tofore, 
som outward good is profitable, 
as money and generallich al þat may be preysed 
by mesure or valew of money, 
and som good is honest 
as honour and worschep. 
Þanne 
as in profitable good stonden twey vertues, 
on in gret spendyng and cost as magnificencia, 
and anoþer in mene spendyng and cost as liberalitas, 
so in honest good stonden twey vertues, 
on in greet honour 
and worschep as magnanimitas, 
and anoþere in mene honour 
and worschep 
and may be cleped 
by a comyn name, 
honoris amatiua. 
[A man may haue hymself] 
in gret honour 
and worschep in þre maner wise, 
for som hauen defaute and failen þerinne 
and is icleped pusillanimus, 
þat is <vnherty> – <‡ mode‡les>; 
and som passen 
and is icleped presumptuosus, proude; 
and som hath hymself wel 
and as he scholde 
and is icleped magnanimus. 
For we seeth þat som is of hymsilf 
able to grete dedes 
and may do grete dedes 
and vse grete dedes 
and is som what vnherty and coward 
and wiþdraweth hymself 
fro suche grete dedes, 
þanne suche oon hath defaute and failleth. 
And somme aƷenward passen and putteþ hemself 
to som dedes 
þe whiche he may not worthilich do 
at þe folle; 
and þe philosofer clepeth suche on ka[u]nus, 
id est, fumosus et ventosus 
(smeche and fol of wynd), 
and we may clepe suche oon presumptuosus. 
Þanne magnanimus is mene bytwene pusillanimus and presumptuosus, 
for he withdraweth hym nouƷt fro grete dedes 
þat he may worthilich do 
atte þe fulle as pusillanimus doþ, 
| noþer taketh more vppon hym 
þan he may worthilich do 
at þe folle as presumptuos dooþ. 
And so it is declared 
what is magnanimitas: 
for as liberalitas 
is mene bitwene auaricia (scarsete and chincherie) 
and prodegalitas (passyng and vnwys spendyng), 
and is þerfore a certeyn vertue abatyng auaricia and moderatyng prodegalitas, 
so, 
for magnanimitas 
is mene bytwene pusillanimitas and presumpcioun, 
it is a vertue abatynge pusillanimitas 
and moderatyng presumcioun. 
For it is declared what is magnanimitas, 
it may sone be iknowe 
where inne it stondeþ; 
and it semeth þat þe philosofer, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
wol mene þat magnanimitas stondeþ 
in honour and worschip, faculte and richesse, 
and in principates, 
and generalliche in al fortune and happes and stondeþ 
not iliche principaliche in al þese. 
For magnanimitas stondeþ principalliche in honour and worschip 
(and not in al honour and worschip 
but in gret honour and worschep) 
and by þe consequent folwyng 
in faculte and richesse 
and in principate 
and in fortune 
and in happes good and yuel. 
For as þe philosofer meneth, 
among outward good þe most is honour and worschep; 
for richesse and principate 
and oþer outward good 
bien not so good as honour and worschep, 
for commonlich men ordeynen suche good 
for to come 
þerby to honour and worschep. 
Þanne as it is iseid 
þat þe vertue fortitudo stondeþ principalliche 
in defficulte and peril 
in werre and in bataille, 
for þerinne is most difficulte, 
and stondeþ by þe consequent 
folwyng in oþere perils 
so þat he þat is fortis bereþ hymself wel also in oþere perils, 
so magnanimitas stondeþ principalliche 
in honour and worschep 
in þe beste outward good, 
and by þe consequent folwyng it >stondeth in richesse and in | principate 
so þat magnanimitas haþe hymsylf 
as he schulde in hauyng richesse and principate 
and in takynge aworth fortune 
and gode happes and euel. 
For magnanimus is ilikned to tetragonus 
(þat is euene squar 
þat liþ oþer stondeþ liche wel on euery side), 
so magnanimus failleth not þat he ne holdeþ hym apayed. 
For Ʒif he is worschepped or hath gret fortune, 
he is not mysprou<d>e; 
and Ʒif he is despised 
and hath grete infortune and euel happes, 
he holdeþ hym apayed. 
For in eche staat magnanimus 
can haue hymself as he scholde and pusillanimus 
can not suffry fortunes. 
Þerfore Andronicus Peripatheticus seyþ 
þat þe workes of pusillanimus bien wonderful, 
for he ne may suffry worschip 
ne dispite noþer fortune 
noþer good happes noþer yuel. 
Ʒif he is worschepped or hath good fortune, 
he swelleþ and wexeth my<s>prou<d>. 
For it is declared 
what is magnanimitas 
and where inne it stondeþ, 
it is to declarynge how a man may make hym magnanimus. 
For among oþere þat draweth vs to magnanimitas, 
oon is to sette litel 
by outward good 
what good it 
euere be – worschep 
oþer principate 
oþer othere suche good what euere it be. 
For it is iseyd 
þat pusillanimus 
can not suffry fortune, 
but wexit mysproude 
for a lite fortune 
and is ouercome in vnfortune and myshap. 
But magnanimus fareth not so, 
but as it is seide 
he can suffre fortune 
and in eche staat bere hymsilf 
as he scholde. 
And þe cause whi a man can not suffre fortune 
is for he setteth 
to moche by outward good. 
Þerfore whan he geteth eny such good, 
hym semeth þat he hath gete al 
and swelleth and wexeth mysproude; 
and whan he leseth ought þerof, 
he weneth to lese al and is ouercome and sory. 
| Þerfore Ʒif we telleth pris of workes of vertue, 
and setteþ not bi outward good 
but in as muche as outward good 
is mene for to come 
to vertues in alle wise, 
we hauen þe vertue magnanimitas 
and conneþ suffre fortune. 
For Ʒif richesse encreseth and oþer outward good, 
‡ we bien not mysproude þerfore, 
for we acounteþ 
not suche good principal good and best. 
And Ʒif we haueþ myshappes, 
[we] holdeþ vs apayed 
as we schulde for we setteþ lite by suche good. Chapter XXIII The philosofer, iiii Ethicorum, 
reherseth manye propretees of hym 
þat is magnanimus, 
among þe whiche we may rekene sixe 
þat nedeþ to kynges and princes to haue. 
So þat þe firste proprete of magnanimus be 
þat he haue hymself wel in perilles of werre and of bataille 
and noƷt to haue hymself to peril 
to smale thinges and nedes 
but for grete, 
as for suche of þe whiche ‡ may come greet profite and good. 
And whan he putteþ hymsilf so to peril, 
he schal be so constans and stedefast 
in his doyng 
so þat Ʒif he seeþ þat it is spedfol, 
he schal not spare his owne lif 
as þe philosofre seith, 
iiii Ethicorum. 
Þe secunde, 
magnanimus schal haue hymsilf 
wel in rewardes and Ʒiftes, 
for magnanimus setteþ litel 
by outward good 
and muche by workesofvertues. 
Þerfore for he 
þat Ʒeuethmanye of Ʒiftes doþ workes of vertues, 
it is semelich to magnanimus 
to Ʒeue manye Ʒiftes 
as it is iseid, 
iiu Ethicorum. 
Þe þridde, 
it longeth to hym to make fewe workes, 
for it is iseid 
þat magnanimitas stondeþ in grete workes, 
as in workes of þe whiche may come grete worschep, 
and suche workes fallen not ofte. Perfore it is semelich to magnanimus 
to make fewe workes. 
Þe ferþe, 
it is semelich to hym to schewe hymselfe out|ward 
as it is inward 
so 
þat he be a soth sayere 
and not a liere, 
and to be open and iknowe outward 
whether he loueth oþer hateþ, 
and to telle more of sothnesse 
and of trouthe þan of opynyons 
and of tales 
as þe philosofer wolde mene, 
iii[i] Ethicorum. 
Þe fifte, 
it is semelich to magnanimus 
to sette not by þei he be preised noþer 
þei he be blamed, 
for suche doyng is acounted among outward good of þe whiche he telleth no gret pris, 
[for as it is seide 
he setteþ litel by outward good]. 
Þe sixte, 
he schal not flatry noþer prayse Ʒiftes of oþer men, 
and namelich he schal not do so 
in comparisoun to outward good. 
For he þat playneth of outward good 
oþer prayseth outward good of oþere men 
for to haue suche good 
is som del pusillanimus, 
for he setteth to moche by outward good. 
For Seneca seit þat no thing is more dere ibouƷt þan what is gete by prayers. 
Þese propretees þat þe philosofer rekeneth, Ʒif þei bien wel vnderstondyng, 
kynges and princes schul haue; 
for kynges schulde not put hymself 
to al maner peril 
but for greet nede 
as for defence of þe fey 
and sauyng of þe regne. 
And Ʒif þer happeth so grete nede 
þat a kyng schal put his men 
and hymself to peril, 
he schulde be constans 
and stedefast and magnanimus 
þat he be al redy 
to put his lif in peril 
for worschep of God 
and for þe comune profit. 
Þe secunde, 
kynges and princes schulde Ʒeue many Ʒiftes, 
for in þe heiƷere gree þei bien aboue oþer men, and þe more good and riches 
þei han in passing oþer men, 
in so moche þei schulde passe oþer men 
in werkis of vertuis 
and in reward and Ʒiftis. 
Þe þridde, 
þei scholde make fewe workes, 
for grete workes and nedes 
ben not so manye as oþere. 
Þanne it is not semelich for kynges and princes 
to spede by hemself 
al maner nedes 
by þe nedes neuer so litel and smale, 
noþer it | is semelich 
to hem to do al workes and nedes; 
but for to take þe more hede 
to grete doynges and nedes 
þat bien fewe, þei schulde commytte to oþere men smale nedes 
þat ben manye. 
Þe ferþe, 
þey schul schewe hemsilf outward suche as þei ben inward for þei bien þe rule of oþere 
and þe reule schulde be not fals ne crokede. 
Also þei schulde be oponliche iknowe wheþer þey loue oþer hate – <and rese opo no man vnwamed nor sodaynly 
nor with feyned sembland of luf> – so 
þat þei hate opunlich vices 
and pursewe euel doers 
and suffre not passyng euel doers alyue. 
Also he schulde oponliche louye good men 
and do hem worschip, 
for in þat wise he schal best brynge al þe puple 
þat is vnder hem 
to be riƷtfol and vertuous. 
Þe fifte, 
it is semelich to kynges and princes to recche not 
þey þey be preysed among men, 
for þei þat ben set in dignite hauen many flaterers 
þat tellen tales 
þat bien likyng to hem; 
and Ʒif þey trowen suche flaterers, 
it happeth hem to wirche 
not after resoun and lawe 
but after passioun and wille. 
Þanne kynges and princes 
and al þat bien in dignite schulde so moche þe lasse recche of preysynge of men, 
in so moche as þey hauen þe mo flaterers 
þat fondeþ to peruerte hem 
wiþ flateryng and preysyng. 
Þe sixte, 
for kynges and princes schulde be suffisaunt to hemsilf 
in outward good and catel, 
as it schal be declared 
in þe þridde book 
þere we schal trete of reulyng of regnes, 
it is not semelich to hem 
to make here 
mone and to praye Ʒiftes 
of outward good and catel. 
Þanne alle þe propretees 
þat bien assigned schal accorde 
and be semlich to kynges and princes. 
Wherfore it is semelich 
þat eche of hem be magnanimus. Chapter XXIV Men louen worschep 
and ben som tyme iblamed 
and som tyme ipraysed 
as þe philosofer | wol mene, iiii Ethicorum. 
For we blamen som men 
þat tellen 
þat þey recchen not of here owne worschep, 
and also for we blame som men 
þat desiren moch worschip, 
a[nd] we prise som men 
þat reccheþ 
not of here owne worschep. 
Þan recche of propre worschip 
is to preysyng 
in on manere 
and to blamyng in anoþer maner, 
for som men reccheþ not of worschep 
for þei wolde not do workes 
and dedes worthi worschep 
and is þerfore to blame. 
Þan we schul [recche] of worchep and not desire to gret worschep 
noþer sette oure fynal entent in worschep, 
but we schal do werkes 
and dedus worþ worschep. 
And workes worþy worschep 
may be take in twey wyse: 
oþer as þei ben proporcionat to vs, 
oþer as þei ben worþy gret worschep. 
As in spendyng and cost bien twey vertues: liberalitas, 
þat stondeþ in mene spendyng and cost 
as it is proporcionat to vs; 
and magnificencia, 
þat stondeþ in greet spendyng and cost in so moche 
as it is greet and strecchet to gret workes; 
so in honour and worschep stonden twey vertues: oon þat stondeþ in mene worschep 
and as it is proporcionate to vs 
(and þis vertue hatte honoris amatiua, 
as þe philosofer meneþ), 
and anoþer vertue þat stondeþ 
in gret honour and worschep as magnanimitas. 
Þan þe same workes may be workes of 
oþer vertues 
as of magnanimitas also. 
For he þat doþ workes and dedis of fortitudo 
and putteþ him to fyƷƷte, 
Ʒif he doþ so 
for he haþ likyng in suche dedis, 
þan he is fortis; 
and Ʒif he doþ so for suche dedes 
ben worthi gret worschep, 
þanne he is magnanimus. 
Also Ʒif he doþ werkes of chastite for likynge 
þat he hath þerinne, 
þanne he is chaste and temporate; 
and Ʒif he doþ suche werkes 
for þei bien worthi greet worschep, 
þanne he is magnanimus. 
Þerfore þe propre mater of magnanimitas 
is not dedes of werre and of bataille 
noþer perel – 
but suche dedes ben þe mater of fortitudo 
– noþer delicate þynges sensible and likynge, 
for þerinne stondeþ temporancia. 
But þe proper | mater of magnanimitas 
is honour and worschep; 
for al þat magnanimus doþ, 
he doþ it for it is worthi gret worschip. 
Þanne as it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum, magnanimitas is a certeyn ornate and highnesse of al vertues. 
For [as] magnanimus doþ 
þe workes of liberalite in most excellent manere, 
so magnanimitas is a sertein ornate and hiƷghnesse of alle vertues, 
for workis of alle vertuis ben worþi honour and worchep; 
wherfor magnanimus doþ 
þe workes of alle vertues. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
þat it longeth not to magnanimus to fle hym 
þat wameth hym, 
þat is þe dede of prudencia: 
noþer it longeth hym to do vnriƷt 
þat longeth iniusticia. 
Þanne magnanimus doþ werkis of oþer vertues 
and doþ hem excellentlich. 
Þan [for] amonge outward good worschep is excellent good, 
he þat doun werkis of vertuis 
for þei ben worþi honour and worschip, 
doþ suche workes [þe more] excellentliche 
þa[n] Ʒif he dide suche workes 
for delectacioun and likynge 
þat he hath þerinne. 
Þanne it is wel seid 
þat magnanimitas 
makeþ al most vertues, 
and it is iseid 
þat he makeþ hem alle parfit and hiƷteth hem also; 
for by magnanimite we doun 
þe dedes of alle vertues 
þe more excellentliche, 
þe more manerliche, 
and hiƷtliche, and parfitliche. 
For it is declared 
what is magnanimitas 
and how it hath itsilf 
to oþere vertues, 
it is sone iknowe which is þe vertue of þe whiche now we schal trete: 
þat vertue hatte honoris amatiua. 
For as þe same workes 
may be þe workis of oþer vertuis and of magnanimitate, 
so þe same workis may be þe workis of oþer vertuis 
and of þe vertue 
þat hatte honoris amatiua 
by þe whiche vertue we louen honour and worschep. 
And workes of oþere vertues bien worthi greet honour and worschep 
þat perteyneth to magnanimite; 
but as þei bien proporcionate to vs 
and to mene honour and worschip, 
he perteyneth to þe vertue 
þat | hatte honoris amatiua, 
as it were loue and desire of worschep. 
Þanne as it is semelich 
þat a kyng oþer a prince be magnificus and liberalis, 
so it is semelich 
þat he be magnanimus 
and loue and desire honoure and worschep 
and is þanne icleped honoris amatiua. 
For it is semelich þat kynges and princes loue and desire honoure and worschep 
in þe manere and wise 
as it is iseide so 
þat he loue and desire to do workes 
þat bien worthi honoure and worschep. 
For it semeth þat þis vertu honoris amatiua 
is to magnanimite 
[as] formositas of body 
is to pulcritudo. For Ʒif litel men in here membris and lemes 
whan here lemes ben proporcionate and acordyng ben formosi, schaplich, 
but not pulcri 
(for pulcritudo, fairnesse, 
is not but in a gret body), 
so he þat doþ workes 
þat ben worthi mene honour and worschep – such oon 
is cleped honoris amatiuus 
and is propreliche icleped magnanimus 
whan he doþ workes 
þat bien worthy gret honour and worschep. 
Þanne for a kyng oþer a prince doþ no foul dede in grete 
nedes noþer in mene, 
but doþ alwey workes 
þat ben worthi gret honour and worschep, 
it is wel seid þat a kyng oþer a prince haue 
þis vertue honoris amatiua 
and be honoris amatiuus. 
But we vseth þis name pulcritudo 
for al maner fairenesse, 
formositas for semlich schap. Chapter XXV The philosofer, iiii Ethicorum, 
clepeth hym 
þat putteþ hymself meneliche 
to worschep not magnanimus but temporatus. 
Þanne for temporatenus 
in worschep is humilitas, mekenesse, 
þe vertue þat þe philosofer clepeth honoris amatiua stondeþ 
in mene worschep 
and may þerfore, 
as it semeth, 
be icleped humilitas. 
But Ʒif we seyn so þat, 
| som doutes may arise; 
for ech magnanimus is honoris amatiuus and loueth and desireth honour and worschip, 
and eche magnificus is liberalis. 
Wherfore Ʒif honoris amatiua 
is a certeyn humilite, mekenesse, 
þanne ech magnanimus is humilis, meke, 
and þat semeth contrarie to itself. 
For humilis, 
he þat is meke, 
doþ reuerence to oþere 
and as it is seid, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
magnanimus despiseth oþere. 
Þerfore it is to wetynge 
þat but omnis magnanimus were humilis, meke, 
we Ʒeueth not to lordes 
and to princes couenable doctrine and lore; 
for Ʒif it were so, 
we scholde teche hem 
to be withoute vertues. 
For withoute humilite 
no man may haue vertues at þe folle. 
Þanne for to declare þe sothnesse 
it is to declarynge 
þat wiþoute humilite 
no man may be magnanimus. 
Magnanimitas and humilite and suche vertues morale stondeþ in passions of þe soule. 
For in so moche 
þat þei ben icleped vertues, 
‡ þei reulen vs to goode 
by resoun 
and moderateth oure passions 
þat we go not out of þe weye fram þe good of resoun. 
But passions maken vs go out of þe weye 
þat ledeþ to good of reson, 
as it is iseid tofore hond, 
and þat may happe in twey maner wise. 
Furste, for passions makeþ vs inclined to do aƷenst resoun. 
Þe second, 
for passions wiþdraweth vs and letteþ vs to do as resoun wolde. 
Wherfore for passiouns inclineth vs to do aƷenst resoun, 
vs nedeþ a vertue to withdrawe vs, 
as it fareth of temporancia 
þat withdraweth vs fro sencible delectacioun and likynge. 
But whan passions withdrawith and lettiþ vs to do as resoun wolde, 
vs nedith not a vertu to wiþdrawe 
but vs nedith a vertu to excite vs and conforte, 
as it fareth of fortitudo 
þat exciteth and conforteth 
vs to peril of bataille 
and | of werre more [þan] it withdraweth vs þerfro. 35 40 f. 35v 40 
Þanne for withdrawyng and excityng 
bien som del contrarie and formaliche dyuerse, 
þe same vertue is not principaliche 
of itself withdrawyng and excityng, 
noþer þe same vertue is principaliche moderatynge passions 
and excitynge vs to do aƷenst resoun and lettynge vs to do as resoun axeth. 
Þanne þerfore it is þat Ʒif þe same þyng 
itake diuersliche wiþdraweth [vs] and exciteþ, 
it nedeþ þerinne to haue twey vertues, 
on excityng and on oþer withdrawyng. 
And we seeth þat magnanimitas stondeþ 
in gret worschep, 
and gret worschep in som wise is gret gode; 
and greet good, 
by cause þat it is greet, 
letteþ vs and withdraweþ vs 
þat we pursewe it not by cause of difficulte. 
And for it is good, 
it ex[c]itith us and drawen vs to fonde for to com þerto. 
Þan in gret honour and worschip 
and in greet good it happeth to faile in twey maner wise: first, Ʒif we fondeþ more 
þan we scholde for to come 
þerto for it is good; 
þe second, Ʒif we draweth vs þerfro more 
þan resoun wolde by cause of difficulte. 
Wherfore in suche doynge vs nedeþ tweye vertues: oon þat exciteþ vs and conforteþ 
þat we withdrawe vs not by cause of difficulte 
[and þis vertue hatte magnanimitas]; 
and anoþer þat withdraweth vs þat we fonde not more 
þan resoun wolde for to come 
þerto by cause 
þat it is good, 
and þis vertue hatte humilitas. 
And eche magnanimus is humilis, 
for it is inpossible 
to be magnanimus 
and nouth good 
as þe philosofer preueth, 
iiii Ethicorum. 
No man is good 
Ʒif he fondeþ to come 
to worschep passyng þat resoun axeth. 
Bot [for] nedelich magnanimitas 
exciteth vs to fonde to come 
to som grete good þat we be not withdrawe by cause of difficulte, 
it nedeþ þat humilitee be anexed 
þerto þa[t] we | fonde not more 
þan resoun axeth 
by cause of þe goodnesse, 
ellis magnanimus were vicious. 
Men may desire greet honour and worschip 
and greet good boþe 
by magnanimite and humilite, 
but not by þe same cause and resoun. 
For whan man desireth worschip and honour and greet good 
and is not withdrawe 
by cause of difficulte, 
þanne he is magnanimus; 
but for he desireth not passynge 
þat resoun axeth, 
he is humilis. 
Magnanimitas and humilite ben diuerse in twey wise. First, 
for magnanimitas exciteþ principaliche 
and wiþdraweth 
by þe consequent folwyng. 
Þerfore it is iseid 
þat magnanimus dispiseth oþere, 
and not for he doþ hem viciousliche wrong, 
but for he is so greet of herte 
and so excited by þe vertue 
þat hym is leuere dispise workes and wordes of men 
þan leue þerfore workes and dedes. 
And humilitas doþ aƷenward 
and wiþdraweth principalliche and exciteth 
by þe consequent folwynge. 
Þerfore it is iseid 
þat humilite doþ reuerence to oþere 
for he seeþ oþer defaute 
þan his owne 
in lefful þynges 
and honest and doþ reuerence to oþere. 
Þe seconde, 
þes vertues ben diuerce, 
for magnanimitas principalliche moderateþ whanhope and vntrist 
þat man be not wiþdrawe 
by cause of difficulte to leue 
and to spare workes 
þat ben worthi gret worschip. 
And humilitas moderateþ principaliche hope 
and trist for man schulde not haue 
to greet hope 
and trist noþer fonde to gete of 
þat goode greet worschep more þan resoun axeth. 
Panne magnanimus is humilis 
in þe manere 
as it is iseid, 
and humilitas is in sum wise mene honoris amatiua; 
for he is cleped humilis 
þat moderateþ hope 
and trist of wynnyng 
and comynge to greet honour and worschip 
and is menliche inclyned to suche honour | and worschep. 
And whether it be al oon 
to be humilis 
and to loue and desire mene honour and worschip, 
oþer Ʒif humilitas 
is þe same vertue 
þat þe philosofer distynguyth 
fram magnanimite 
and clepeth it honoris amatiua, 
it longeth not to þis doyng. 
But Ʒif it happeth vs to make more in moral mater 
we schal declare þat þat vertue honoris amatiua 
of þe whiche þe philosofre spekiþ 
is not in alle wyse þe same vertue 
þat is humilite. 
For þilke of þe which þe philosofer spekiþ 
[þat] incliniþ, as it is iseide, 
to men[e] honour and worschip, 
is in þe appetite sensitif, 
and humilitas in þe appetite intellectif. Chapter XXVI 
By þat is iseid 
it is declared 
þat humilitas and magnanimitas 
ben diuerse vertues; 
for þei þe same vertue abate superfluite and moderateþ lacke and defaut, 
Ʒet neuere þis tweyne 
may longe liche principaliche 
to þe same vertue. 
Þanne to magnanimite it longeth to abate wanhope and despoire 
þat we be not 
in despeyre of greet good 
þat we desiren, 
and þerto it longeth 
to moderate hope 
and trist þat we fonde not more 
þan resoun wolde to come to soche good, 
and doþ not eiþer liche principallich. 
For by cause þat magnanimus fondeþ to haue greet good and worschep, 
þe vertue magnanimitas exciteþ vs more to greet doynge 
þan it withdraweth vs þerfram. 
Þanne magnanimitas abateþ despeyr more principallich 
þat we wiþdrawe vs not fram greet doyng, 
and by þe consequent folwynge it moderateth hope 
and trist þat we fonde not to do grete doyng aƷenst resoun; 
and humilitas doþ aƷenward 
as it is iseid tofore. 
Wherfore by cause 
þat þes twey vertues ben diuerse, 
it is to wetyng what maner | vertue is þat vertue þat is iclepede humilitas. 
Wherfore it is to wetyng þat as touchyng magnanimite 
it happeth to do to muche oþer to lite, 
and so it fareth of humilite; 
for as it is iseid magnanimitas 
is a vertue 
þat exciteth and conforteþ vs 
þat we be not wiþdrawe 
by cause of difficulte fram workes 
þat ben worthi greet worschep. 
Þanne þerinne som men passeth 
as presumptuous men 
and fondeþ more 
þan he schulde to do grete workes and dedes, 
and summe failleth as pusillanimus. 
Þerfore magnanimitas 
is mene bytwene presumpcioun and pusillanimitas. 
Also it is declared þat humilitas 
is a vertue 
þat wiþdraweth vs þat we fonde not 
by cause of goodnesse and likynge 
þat is in dedes of worschip 
and of bataille to do aƷenst resoun. 
Þanne herinne som men passen as proude men 
þat fondeþ to haue excellent worschip more þan he scholde; 
and som failen in settyng hemself lowere þan he scholde, 
as thilke þat axeth no worschep 
noþer doþ dedes 
þat ben worthi worschep, 
and þat is not doyng of humilite 
but of violence and wrecchednesse. 
Þanne humilitas is mene 
bytwene pruyde 
and wreched lownesse and magnanimitas is mene bytwene presumpcioun and pusillanimitas. 
For it is declared what is humilitas, 
it may be sone iknowe 
where inne it stondeþ; 
for humilis setteþ his entent to abate pruyde 
and moderate deieccioun 
and wrecched lownesse. 
Þanne humilitas stondeþ 
in pruyde and in deieccioun, 
wrecched lownesse, 
but not ileche principalliche; 
for humilitas abateth pruyde principalliche 
and moderateþ deieccioun 
by þe consequent folwynge. 
Þanne it is notabeliche to wetyng 
þat [whan] 
a vertue is more withdrawynge 
þan | excityng, 
it is principalliche contrarie 
to superfluite and passinge 
by þe whiche we bien excited, 
and by þe consequent folwyng 
it is contrarie to þe defaute in lakke 
by þe whiche we bien wiþdrawe. 
But whan a vertue is more excityng 
þan wiþdrawyng, 
þan it is agenward; 
for þanne it is principaliche contrarie 
to þe defaute 
to þe whiche we ben withdrawe 
and is by þe consequent folwynge contrarie 
to þe excellent 
hon[or]ys 
by þe whiche we bien excited. 
Þanne for magnanimitas 
is a vertue excityng 
to greet doynge and deficulte, 
it is more contrarie to pusillanimitas 
þat is a defaute, 
wiþdrawyng vs in suche doynge, 
þan it is contrarie to presumpcioun, 
þat is excellent and passyng, 
excityng vs to do suche doyng. But humilitas doþ agenward, 
for it is a vertue wiþdrawyng vs þat we passe not reson 
in fondyng to haue excellentnesse wis and worschip. 
It is principalliche contrarie to pruyde 
þat passeth 
in suche doyng and dedes 
and by þe consequent folwynge 
it is contrarie to deieccioun, 
wrecched lownesse. 
Þerfore in workes 
þat bien worthi honour 
and worschip it happeth to faille 
and to do amys not onliche 
by pruyde bute deieccioun, 
wrecched lownesse. 
For Ʒif a man loweth hymself notablich more 
þan his staat axet and aƷenste reson, 
he is deiectus and foule and beste 
for he knoweth not his owne astaat; 
oþer he is prout and bostere, 
for þerby somme fondeth 
to gete excellentnesse 
and bost and presyng and loweth hymself more þan he schulde. 
Þerfore þe philosofer, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
clepeth certeyn men of Grees proute and bosters, 
and beþ Latomences; 
and he clepeþ hem proute and bosters, 
‡ for passyng [þat] here astaat axeth, 
þey were icloþed | 
in foule clothing and vnworthi and trowede þerby to haue sum worschip 
and to be holde excellent. 
And so þere it is wrete 
þat in passynge doyng 
and in greet defaute and faillynge 
is bost and pruyde. For it is declared where inne humilitas stondeþ (for it stondeþ principalliche in abatyng of pruyde 
and by þe consequent folwynge 
in moderatyng of deieccioun, 
wrecched lownesse), 
it is to declarynge 
þat it is semelich 
þat kynges and princes haue þis vertue; 
and þat we may preue be twey weyes. 
Þe firste is itake by magnanimitas; 
þe seconde, 
by doynge and dedes. 
For it is iseid tofore 
þat no man is verrey magnanimus 
but he be good and humilis, meke, 
and þat alwey humilitas 
is anexed to magnanimitas, 
wherfore, 
Ʒif it is semeliche 
þat þei haue þe vertue magnanimitas, it is semelich 
þat þei haue þe vertue humilitas. 
For kynges and princes schulde so fonde to do workes worthi honour and worschip not passynge resoun 
but as it is accordynge to here 
astaat as he doþ 
þat bien humilis, meke, 
and þat þei schulle not sette here felicite in excellentnesse 
and worschip 
as proute men doþ. 
For he schulde do good workes 
and worthi honour 
and worschip by cause of good 
þat cometh þerof so 
þat he passe not here owne astaat to be iholde excellent. 
Þe seconde, 
it is semeliche 
þat a kyng oþer a prince be humilis by cause of dedes 
þat he schal do, 
for a proud man wolde more þan he schulde be iholde excellent 
and takeþ 
ofte vppon hym dedes 
þat passeth his owne myƷt and strengthe. 
Þerfore it is semelich 
þat man be meke so 
þat he take heede 
of his owne astaat, 
of his owne proper faculte, 
and takeþ not vppon hym more þan he scholde. 
For ofte a proude man | more þan reson axeth desireth 
to be excellent and putteth hymself and oþere to peril 
more þan he scholde 
and may not brynge to good ende dedes 
þat he bygynneth. 
Þanne þe worse 
it is to putte þe comune good [in] peril, 
þe more besiliche kynges and princes scholde forsake and putte away pruyde. 
For comynliche a proud lord putteþ þe puple to perel. Chapter XXVII 
After þat we hauen determined of vertues 
þat stondeþ 
in outward good 
and ischewed how kynges and princes schulde be highed 
wiþ thilke virtues, 
it is to spekynge of þe vertue mansuetudo 
þat stondeþ 
in outward euel and harm. 
For it is seid tofore 
þat wherinne it euer be 
þat þei happen 
to do yuele or wel, it happeþ to passe oþer to faille and to do lite, 
þare mot be som vertue by þe whiche we bien irewled to do wel, 
moderatynge passyng doyng and abatyng scarsete and defaute. 
And in takynge wreche of outward euel and harm 
þat oþere men doþ, 
som men passeth 
as wrethful men 
þat desiriþ to gret wre[che]. 
For wreþ comiþ here 
of for we desire wretche] and ponisching; 
and sum while man strongliche desiriþ wretche], 
is blood hetiþ aboute þe herte, 
and he wexiþ wroth. 
Þan sum men bien wrethful and passeth in takyng wreche oþer in desirynge wreche, 
and som men ben not wrethfol 
and leteþ al wrong passe; 
and ner noþer herof ‡is good. 
For to be wrooþ 
to ech man 
and to axe wreche of al thyng is euel 
and to blame 
as wrethful men doþ. 
Also neuer be wroth and neuere axe 
wreche in no wise 
is not to presynge, 
for it is to doyng aƷenst resoun. 
For resoun wol þat sum punycioun be ydo; 
and þat it is to doynge 
þat man be wrooþ 
to wham he scholde 
and as moche as he scholde. 
For to be wrooth in place and tyme, it is a worke of vertue; 
wher|fore Ʒif it happeth to passe 
and to faille 
in þe passions of wreche 
and in desiryng wreche, 
þer mot be a vertue 
to abate suche passyng desire and moderatynge 
þe defaute of suche desire 
Ʒif it is to ligte; 
and þis vertue is mansuetudo. 
And so it is declared what is mansuetudo; 
for as fortitudo is mene 
bytwene drede and hardinesse, 
so mansuetudo is mene betwene wrethe, 
by þe whiche we desiren wreche, 
and þe contrarie of wrathe, 
þat hatte inirascibilitas, 
by þe whiche we forƷeueþ yuel and harme 
þat is ido to vs. 
Also he is mitis 
þat desireth not wreche of al thinges 
noþer failleth 
by so moche of punicioun 
þat he wolde in none wise 
þat men were ipunysched, 
but also he fo[r]Ʒeueth som tyme and ponyscheth som tyme by ordre of resoun. 
Wherfore as fortitudo abateth drede and moderateth hardynesse 
so mansuetudo abateþ 
wrethe and moderateth þe contrarie 
þat hatte inirascibilitas. 
For it is declared 
what is mansuetudo 
it may be sone iknowe 
where inne it stondeþ; 
for it stondeþ 
as it is iseid 
in wreþþe 
and in the contrary of wrethe 
þat hatte inirascibilitas; 
but it stondeþ principalliche in wrethe. 
For mansuetudo principalliche abateþ wrethe, 
and by þe consequent folwyng it moderateþ passions contrarie to wrethe, 
for it is kyndelich to vs to desire 
wreche of euel and harm 
þat is ido to vs. 
Also for mannys owne harm 
may vnnethe be so lite 
but it seme hym 
þat it is moche, 
not onliche we ben inclined to ponysche hem 
þat don vs harm 
but also it is kyndelich 
to vs to desire more wreche þan þe harm axeth. 
For þe harm þat is ido 
to vs semeth to vs more 
þan it is and so we desiren to take more wreche of hem 
þat doun vs to harm 
þan þe harme axeth. 
Þanne it is difficultee | 
to abate wrethe and not desire 
wreche of wronges more þan reson axeth. 
Þanne manye fayleth and maken defaute desiryng to moche wreche and fewe trespasseth 
and failleth 
in desyryng to lite wreche. 
Þerfore Ʒif a vertue stondeþ 
in good and in difficulte, 
mansuetudo is principalich contrarie to wrethe 
and is by þe consequent 
fo[l]wynge contrarie to inirascibilite 
þat is contrarie to wrethe and moderateth inirascibilite 
and þat is knowe 
by þe name mansuetudo. 
For Ʒif we taken heede and knoweth þe name mansuetudo, 
it is þe name of temperament of wrethe. 
And þat [it] is semelich þat kynges and princes haue þis vertue mansuetudo 
it is not hard to declare. 
For by cause þat wrethe peruerteþ 
þe dom of resoun, 
it is not semelich 
þat kynges and princes ben wret[h]ful for principalliche 
in hem scholde be greet resoun and vnderstondyng. 
For as we seeth Ʒif þe tonge 
be infecte wiþ colera oþer wiþ oþere humores, 
we demen not ariƷt of sauours; 
so Ʒif þe appetite is infecte 
by inmoderate wrethe oþer 
by inmoderate passions, 
oure dom of resoun is peruerted and apeyred. 
Þan Ʒif it is inconuenient 
þat þe reule be peruerted, 
myswend and croked, 
þe kyng þat scholde be 
as it were 
þe merour 
and ensample of leuyng and reule of dedes and doynge, 
it is inconuenient 
þat he be wrethful 
lest he be peruerted 
and myswend by wrethe. 
Also Ʒif he were in none wise wrethful 
and in none wise imeued to take wreche, 
it were vnsemliche; 
for Ʒif no ponyschyng 
were ido noþer wreche itake in þe regne, 
men wold be wrongful 
and do wrong 
to oþere men and þanne policie ne myƷte not dure ‡. 
Þanne no man scholde be wroth for hate noþer desire ponyssioun for hate. 
But it is to be wroth 
by cause of loue | 
and of good wille; 
and so ponyssion scholde be desired for loue 
and for good wille. 
For ponyschioun schulde be desired for loue of riƷtwisnesse oþer for loue of þe comune profit, 
for þerwithoute þe comyn profite may not dure. 
Wherfore Ʒif a man 
were so mylde þat hym were leuere let riƷt persche þan to tak wreche, 
he were not vertuous. 
Þanne þe more it longeþ 
to kynges and princes to kepe and saue riƷt 
and þe comyn profit, 
þe more semelich it is to hem 
þat [þei] ben meued 
to do ponyschyng 
and take wreche. 
Wherfore þei kynges scholde not be wrethfol, 
þei scholde be meued 
by þe ordre of resoun 
to do ponyschyng 
and take wreche. 
And for mansuetudo doth so, 
it is semelich 
to a kynge be mansuetus. Chapter XXVIII 
As þis work axeth we hauen sufficientlich 
ispoke of vertues 
þat stondeþ 
in good of itself 
and of vertues 
þat stonden in outward euel and harme. 
Now it is to spekyng of vertues 
þat stondeþ in outward good 
as we comuneth with oþere in wordes and in dedes. 
And wordes and dedes 
in þe whiche we comuneth wiþ oþere 
se[r]uen vs to þre: 
to frendschip, to sothnesse, 
and to murþe, likynge and pleiƷ. 
For in þat we comuneth wiþ oþere 
þe whiche in wordes 
and dedes worschipynge hem in fonggyng hem 
þat we may be frendlich and affabilis. 
Þanne amicabilitas and affabilitas 
of þe whiche we schal speke heere 
is nouƷt ellis 
but haue riƷt conuersacioun 
wiþ oþere 
and ordeyne oure wordes 
and dedes to theu conuersacioun. 
Þe seconde, oure wordes and dedes serueth vs to sothnesse, 
for þerby we ben idemed whiche we ben. 
And to sothnesse 
and to verite of þe whiche we speken of here 
is nouƷt elles but þat a man be not a bostere, 
so þat he make not bost of hymself passynge his wordes and dedes, 
and | so 
þat he be not a scomere, 
noþer despise in wordes and dedes, 
noþer schewe hymself vnworthy in wordes 
and dedes passyng resoune, 
but þat he be trewe 
and oponliche iknowe suche as he is. 
Þe þridde, wordes and dedes 
may be ordeyned to game and likynge and murþe so 
þat a man be in þew manere merie. 
Þanne as it is iseid tofore in wordes and dedes in þe whiche we comuneth wiþ oþere stondeþ þre vertues: 
‡ amicabilitas, 
þat hath anoþer name 
and may be cleped affabilitas; veritas, 
þat is cleped apericio also; 
and debita iocunditas, 
þat is cleped eutrapelia of þe philosofer. 
Þanne in comenyng wiþ oþere, 
Ʒif we wol haue good conuersacioun, 
we schul be þewliche iocunde, veraces and amicabiles; 
of alle þese we schul speke. 
But first of amicabilite, 
as it were frenschipe: 
for we seeþ þat in communicacioun wiþ oþere somme passeth, 
for a schewiþ hymself to amicabiles, 
to frendeliche, 
and suche ben plesyng men 
and flaterers 
and scheweth hemself 
so communicatif and felowlich 
þat þei wolleþ 
no man greue 
but preyseth al wordes 
and dedes of oþere men. 
And somme aƷenward lacken to moche of þis conuersacioun 
for þei ben trewauntis (discoli) 
and agrestes (solutarie) 
and may not haue conuersacioun wiþ oþere; 
and eyþer falleþ of rigt resoun, 
for a man schal not schewe hymself to oþere so felowlich 
þat he be holde plesynge and flatere, 
noþer he schal so moche wiþdrawe hym out of felowschipe þat he be holde discolus (froward), contrarie and stryuere. 
Þanne for a vertue is mene bytwene to moche and to lite, 
þer mot be som vertue 
abatynge 
what is to moche and moderatyng 
what is to lite; 
and þis vertue is amicabilitas 
and hatte affabilitas also. 
For affabilitas, 
þat is vertue, 
is not elles but mene beryng in | conuersacioun of men so 
þat we passe not in suche conuersacioun 
as flaterers doun 
noþer faille and do to luyte in conuersacioun 
as stryuers and froward schrewes doun. 
For it is isey 
what is amicabilitas, 
as we speketh þerof heere at þis tyme 
(for it is a vertue abatyng stryf and moderatyng plesyng 
as þe philosofer meneþ, 
ii and iiii Ethicorum), 
it may sone be iknowe 
where inne it stondeþ: 
for it stondeþ 
in wordes and dedes 
as þei ben ordeyned 
to þew conuersacioun 
in þe lif of mankynde. 
For Ʒif a man is kyndeliche sociale beste and componable 
as it is preued, primo Poleticorum, 
it nedeþ, 
in dedes and wordes 
in þe whiche me comyneth wiþ oþere, 
to haue som vertue 
by þe whiche men may haue good co[n]uersacioun. 
Wherfore right resoun 
wol mene þat by diuersete of persones conuersacioun schal be diuers. 
Þey alle men 
þat wol leue in pollici and comynte schulde be amycabiles and affabiles, 
frendlich and good to speke wiþ, 
noþeles not alle men ben, 
noþer schulde be, amicabiles in þe same wise. 
For by cause þat to grete homelichnesse 
is cause of dispisyng of worschep, 
kynges and princes schulde bere hemself 
more sadliche þan oþer men, 
and for to haue þe more worschip and reuerence, 
and for þe dignite of a kyng schulde not be despised 
noþer litel itold of. 
Þerfore, v Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer Ʒeueth cautels of kynges and princes and seiþ þat it is semelich 
þat kynges and princes be iseye among reuerent persones 
lest þei be despised 
oþer litel itold of. 
For as it fareth in takynge of mete 
and in oþere dedes, 
riƷt resoun meneþ 
þat by diuersete of persones 
þe dedes schal be diuerse, 
for som mete is to moche for a seek man 
þat is to lite for an hool man. 
And so it fareth in conuersacioun of men. 
For som homlichnesse 
is acounted a vertue in a kyng 
and is þerfore iclepede | amicabilis; 
and Ʒif a mene persone 
were not more homlich, 
in hym it scholde be acounted a vice 
and not a vertue; 
and he schulde not be cleped amicabilis, frendlich, 
but siluestris, boynard. Chapter XXIX 
As in conuersacioun in lif it happeth to passe 
and to faille 
as it is iseide, 
so in verite it happeþ to passe 
and to faille for veritas stondeþ 
in a certeyn euenesse. 
Þan he þat seith more 
þan it is passeth verite 
and he þat seith lasse 
and denyeth þe sothe failleth of verite. 
Wherfore by cause þat lesyng 
is of itsilf worthi 
to be forsake, 
as it is iseid, iiii Ethicorum, 
þei þat bien not soth seyers noþer apert noþer scheweþ hemsilf such as þei bien – þei ben to blame. 
For it is a maner lesynge to be not apert 
and not shewe hymself suche as he is. 
Þanne fram þis verite 
by þe whiche man scheweth hymselue trewe 
and oponliche suche as he is, 
som men gon out of þe weye and passeth verite 
and scheweth of hemsilf 
in word and in dede grettere dedes þan þei doun 
and makeþ hemself grettere þan þei ben 
and suche bien icleped iaccatores, bosters. 
And somme faillen of þis verite 
by defaute and feyneth of hemsilf sum what þat þei hauen not as sum vnworthi thing, 
oþer hauen som what and denyeth 
þat þei hauen it, 
and þe philosofer clepeth suche men irrones in Grewe 
and ben icleped irrisores and despectores in Latyn, scomers and despisers. 
Þanne nedeth som vertue mene 
by þe whiche þe defaute 
may be moderate and ouerpassyng abated, 
and by þe comyn name þis vertue is cleped veritas. 
Þanne it is iknowe 
what is veritas 
for it 
is a vertue moderatynge despisyng and abatyng bost. 
For it is iknowe 
what is veri|tas it is to knowynge wherinne it stondeþ. 
Wherfore it is to wetynge 
þat þei a man graunte of hymsilf 
oþer wise 
þan it is oþer denyeth 
þe sothe as it is, 
þanne he lieþ; 
natheles he may wiþoute lesyng telle sum of þe sothe and nouƷt alle. 
Þanne he þat wol be veray 
schal not feyne of hymsilf goodnesse 
þat he hath not noþer graunty 
in hymsilf malice 
þat he troweth not þat be in hymsilf. 
Nathales it nedeth not to telle of hymself 
alle þe godnesse 
þat he knoweth of hymself; 
for þei no man scholde liƷe, Ʒit veritas, þe soþe, 
is not to tellyng alwey and euery whare. 
For in place and tyme we may be resoun be stille 
and not telle þe sothe. 
Þanne veritas abateþ bostynge and moderateth despisyng 
but not ileche principaliche; 
but veritas is principalliche contrarie 
to bostynge and abateth boystyng, 
and is by þe consequent folwyng contrarie 
to despisyng 
and moderateth dispisyng. 
Þerfore, iiii Ethicorum, 
capitulo De Veritate, 
þe philosofer seith þat drawynge 
to þe lasse and preyse his owne 
dedes lasse 
þan þei ben worthi is doyng of hym 
þat is prudens. 
Þanne it longeth to hym 
þat is verax in no wise for to preyse hymsilf 
and his dedes more þan þei bien worthi 
as many men doþ. 
For many graunteþ 
grete goodes of hymself 
and ben þerwithoute; 
and byhoteth frendschipe to hym 
þat he knoweth 
and greet good and heelp and doþ 
þerof lite oþer riƷt nouöt in dede; 
and suche bien bosters 
and not apert noþer veraces, 
soth seyers. 
In suche doynge | 
it is in no wise to passynge in þe more 
but it is rather to drawyng 
to þe lasse, 
so þat no lesynge be maad 
noþer passynge notabliche fram þe mene; 
for Ʒif he passeth notabliche fro þe mene, 
in þat he semeth not verax but derisor, 
scomer and dispiser. 
So as Ʒif a man 
were so strong and staleworthe 
þat it were iknowe 
þat he myƷte fighte aƷenst an hundred men, 
Ʒif he wolde seye hymself 
þat he myƷt nouƷt fiƷte 
but oonlich with on wrecche, 
þanne al þat h[ym] 
herde wolde knowe 
þat he scornede. 
Þerfore þerof þe name 
is itake ironie and derisionis, scornyng, 
whan a man preyseth hymsilf 
and his dedes 
notabliche lasse þan þei ben worth. 
Þanne veritas moderateth suche scomyng 
and abateth bostyng, 
but it abateth bostyng mo[re] principalliche þan it moderateth scomynge. 
For as it is iseid, 
in suche doyng me schal drawe more 
to þe lasse þan to þe more, 
and preyse hymself 
and his dedes raþer lasse 
þan þey ben worth, 
þanne he schal passe 
and preyse hymself 
and his dedes more 
þan þey ben worthi. 
And we may assyngne twey causes whi in suche doyng man 
schal drawe to þe lasse: 
þe firste is take 
by his owne persone; 
þe secunde is itake by oþer men. 
For eche man loueth kyndelich his owne good 
þat alwey he weneth 
þat it is more worthi þan it is. 
Þerfore comonliche men bien deseyued of hemself 
and weneth 
þat þei ben more worþi 
þan þei ben. 
Also in talkynge of propre good 
and dedes it is alwey to drawynge to þe lasse, 
for we schal trowe 
þat we louen oure owne good 
and weneth 
þat it be bettre þan it is. 
And þe philosofer toucheth þis resoun 
in þe auctorite 
þat is seid toforehand; 
for he seith þat prudens | 
schal drawe to þe lasse, 
for it is greet pmdencia and redinesse 
for a man to know hymsilf 
and to wete 
þat his owne good semeth bettre þan it is. 
Þe seconde resoun 
is itake by oþer men, 
for þey þat drawen not 
to þe lasse preyseth hemself 
and maketh bost of good 
þat thei hauen not. 
And for comonliche suche bosters 
þat preysen hemself 
ben noyfol to oþer men, 
‡ þerfore by cause of oþere men 
it is semelich 
in suche doyng to drawe to þe lasse 
þat mon be not noyous to oþere men. 
Þe philosofer toucheth þis resoun, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
þere a seiþ 
þat me schal drawe 
to þe lasse for passyng 
bostyng is noyfol. 
It is declared what is veritas of þe whiche we speketh here 
and where inne it stondeþ. 
It may be sone iknowe þat it is semelich to eche kyng and prince to be verax. 
For þei þat drawen notabliche 
to þe lasse and preyseth hemsilf 
and here dedes notabliche lasse worþ, 
þan þei semen scorners 
and bien despised. 
And þei þat bien notabliche 
and preysen hemsilf, 
here good, 
and here dedes notabelich more 
þan þei en worþ, 
ben bosters and noyfol. 
Wherfore Ʒif it is semeliche 
þat kynges and princes 
ben not despised but worschepped, 
noþer noyful but gracious and worthi to be loued, 
it is semelich þat þei be not bosters 
noþer scorners 
but apert and veraces, 
and not bostynge of hemsilf 
and of here 
dedes more þan þey ben worþ, 
noþer byhotynge to oþere men more 
þan he wol leste. 
But þe more men exciten hem in bostyng 
and of þe more 
þat þey mowe make bost, 
þe more semelich it is 
þat kynges and princes 
to be war of bostes. Chapter XXX 
Sum men wenen þat alle wordes and dedes 
þat serueth to pleye 
and to game is veyn | and ydel; 
but it is not so in dede, 
for þat þyng is in vayn and in idel 
þat is not iordeyned for þewe ende. 
Þanne al þat may of itself 
be yordeyned to þew ende 
is not in vayn and in ydel. 
And game and pley þat is liberal, 
honeste and moderat is iordeyned to good ende, 
for it is nedfol in som wise 
in þe lif of mankynde. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
þat rest and pley semen nedfol in þe lif. 
Þanne as þe bodilich sencible wit, 
as þe wit of huyryng and of siöte, 
trauaylleth in huryng and in sight, þerfore kynde ordeyned sleep 
by cause of reste of þe wittes; 
and sleep is nedfol. 
So for in studyng oþer in nedes of þe regne oþer in oþer 
dedes and nedes we trauelleth alwey, 
som delectacioun and likynge of game 
and of pley – Ʒif it is moderate and honest – we taketh among, 
and not an idel, 
among oure besinesse and trauaille. 
Werfore by cause þat in suche game 
and pley it happeth to do wel 
and also to mysdo, 
þer mote be a vertue among game and pley 
by þe whiche we may haue vssilf 
as we scholde [in] game and in pley. 
For in game and in pley 
som men passeth and desireth to do al foule dedes and doynges 
and iapes of þe whiche it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
þat þei fondeþ more to make men liƷe þan to speke 
and do more semeliche doyng, 
and suche bien mynstralles 
and þe philosofer clepeth hem bomoloccos. 
A[nd] þe philosofer likneth suche iapers to foules 
and to bryddes 
þat taken pray þat is ihalwed 
in templis of naciouns. 
For as þulke briddes and foules reccheth not 
in what manere a mowe take sum what of þat prayƷe, so þei þat wolle 
in alle wise make men liƷe and make mowes reccheþ not in what wise þey mowe take wordes and dedes of oþere men and turne | hem to game and to mowes. 
Þanne þese passen in game and in pleye. 
And somme oþere doun aƷenward and faillen 
and ben icleped dury and agrestes, boynardes, 
and suche soffren no game 
ne pley noþer speken murþe 
but ben wrothe to hem 
þat speken of murþe. 
Þanne it is iknowe 
in what is iocunditas (iocunditas, 
þat hatte also eutrapelia, 
resonable murþe and game, 
as it is a vertue and as we speken þerof at þis tyme), 
for it abateth passyng 
and to moche pley 
and moderateþ scarsetee 
and to luyte pley. 
And þis vertue stondeþ 
in moderatyng scarsete and boynardy in pley 
and abateth passyng 
and to moche pley 
and stondeth not ileche principalliche in eiþer. 
For a vertue stondeþ most principallich 
in þe most difficulte, 
and it is more difficulte 
to abate passyng 
and to moche pley þanne it is to moderate defaute and scarsete of pley. 
For pley hath a manere likynge 
anexed þerto 
by þe whiche we ben more inclyned þerto and hauen more likynge to take delectacioun and likyng of game and of pley, 
þanne we hauen to forsake and leue suche delectacioun and likyng. 
For it is iknowe 
what is eutrapelia 
þat hatte also iocunditas, 
resonable murþe and game, 
[and] where inne it stondeþ 
(for it stondiþ principallich in abatyng passyng 
and to moche pley and game 
and by þe consequent folwyng 
in moderatynge defaute and scarsete of pleye and of game) 
þanne it is to wetynge 
how it is semelich 
þat kynges and princes be iocunde and mery. 
And tofore it is declared 
þat alwey to moche and to luyte is blamed and þe mene ipreysed; 
and suche mene 
þat is in vertues, 
in passions, and sterynges 
is not itake 
by þe quantite of a þyng 
but in comparisoun to vs for, 
| 
as it is iseid in þe chapitres tofore, 
som what it is to moche to oon man 
þat is to litel for anoþer man, 
and agenward. 
Þanne Ʒif it is semelich 
for alle men 
to abate passyng 
and to moche pley, 
it is moche more semelich 
þat kynges and princes vse games 
and pleyes so moderatliche; 
but Ʒif þei dede þei schulde be holde 
but comyne persones oþer agristes, boynardes. 
Þanne it schal not be vnderstonde 
þat kynges and princes schulde haue no solace of game and of pley 
but as þe philosofer seith, 
iiii Ethicorum, game and pley 
þat we schulde vse schulde be liberal and honest. 
Kynges and princes schuldevse suchepley and game so moderatliche 
þat þei seme alwey stedefast and sad 
and in no wise childliche. 
For fram þe childhod it semeth kyndelich to children 
to haue likyng and game and pley, 
wherfore Ʒif þe game 
is not honest it semeth 
þat sum childhod 
is annexed þerto. 
Þanne þe worse 
þat it is to kynges and princes to be childlich, 
þe more moderatlich he schulde vse likynge of pley and of game. 
Also it is declared 
þat delectacioun of pleye and of game 
is not an ydel noþer in veyn 
for it is iordeyned to good ende; 
for among traueile and besinesse we taken recreacioun and confort of pley and of game 
and þerby [be] 
þe more fresch and feruent 
in good workes 
of þe whiche we hauen þe charge. 
Wherfore by cause þat inmoderat and inhonest pley and game 
wiþdraweth vs fro good workes 
and fro þe þew besynesse, 
þanne þe more besynesse and charge of þe comyn profit longen to kynges and princes; 
and þe more excellent þe charge of þe comyn profite 
is passyng singuler profit, 
þe worse it is Ʒif kynges and princes vsen inmoderatliche and inhonestliche delectacioun and likyng of pleye and | of game. 
Þanne nouƷt in alle wise schulde meri wordes 
and dedes be forbode Ʒif þei bien honest and moderate, 
and þat more and lasse as diuersete of persone requireth. Chapter XXXI 
Bothe holy men and philosofres accorden here 
inne þat vertues mote be annexed 
and ibounde togedres and meneþ 
þat he þat hath on vertue han alle vertues 
and he þat lackeþ oon lackeþ alle. 
Þanne for it is iknowe 
at þe folle 
þat it is semeliche 
þat kynges [and] princes hauen sum vertues, 
for it is playnlich declared 
þat he mote haue prudencia and iusticia, 
þanne it mot be clerlich yknowe 
þat þei mote haue al vertues, 
for prudencia and iusticia 
may not be without oþere vertues, 
and so no vertue may be parfit 
wiþoute alle vertues. 
And som wise men 
þat treteth of vertues 
menen þat vertues bien connexed 
and ibounde togeders; 
but it semeth þat þe contrarie is soth. 
For we seeþ and knoweth 
þat sum men ben liberal 
and not temporate 
but Ʒeuen hem 
to dedes of lecherie, 
and som aƷeward, 
and some bien chast and coueitous. 
Þan not eche man 
þat hath on vertue hath al vertues, 
noþer it nedeþ 
not þei some vertues 
be necessarie 
and nedfol to kynges and princes 
þat al vertues be necessarie and nedfol to hem. 
And so we seeþ 
þat som man is liberal 
and may not be magnificus, 
for he may not make grete workes 
for he hath nouƷt wherewiþ. 
Þerfore it is to wetyng þat, sexto Ethicorum, circa fine[m], 
þe philosofer preueth clerliche þat vertues beþ connexid. 
But for to asoile suche obieccions he seiþ 
þat we may haue double consideracioun of vertues 
as þei bien kyndelich vertues and vnparfite, 
oþer as þei bien principal vertuous, complet and parfitƷ. 
And kyndeliche vertues and vnparfit nedeþ not to be connexed 
for we | seeth þat som men hauen kyndeliche sum sleyþe and sotelte of wit and hauen þerfore sum vnparfite prudencia 
and bien not chaste, 
ne liberal noþer, 
noþer hauen oþer vertues morale. 
Also we seen þat fro childhode summe bien anoun inclined to dedes of largenesse 
and ben not chast and somme aƷenward and hauen a manere kynde[li]ch chastite and bien not liberal. 
Þanne vertues ben not connexed 
and ibounde togeþeris, 
but vertues þat bien icleped principale 
oþer parfite in hymsilf oþer 
in a certeyn ful ny disposicioun 
mot nedes be connexed. 
And we menen in ny disposicioun 
for by cause of lacke of recheise pore men schulde not be icleped magnifici 
as þe philosofer meneth. 
But Ʒif pore men ben very and parfit liberal accordyng to here richeise and catel, 
þanne þei bien ful ney to be magnifici; 
for Ʒif here good wolde tille, 
anon he wolde make grete workes. 
Þanne to vnderstonde playnliche þis menyng, 
it is to declaryng hou 
no vertue may be parfit 
wiþoute alle oþer vertues. 
Panne it is to wetynge 
þat vs nedeþ vertues 
þat whanne we setten oure entent in good ende 
þat we may by vertues come þewliche to þat ende. 
Þanne in suche doyng it happeth to faille in tweye manere wise: 
first, Ʒif we setteþ ous in an iuel ende 
as vicious men doun; 
for coueitous men studien to chese here ende 
and Ʒeue hemself to coueitousnesse, 
and intemporate men Ʒeuen hem to lecherie, 
and so of oþere. 
Þe seconde, 
it happeth to faille 
in suche doynge 
Ʒif we cometh not to þat ende in þew manere, 
for som wole Ʒeue moneye 
and Ʒiftes and sette here ende in workes of largenesse; 
but he reccheth not where of he taketh | 
oþer of wham he takeþ 
so þat þei mowe Ʒeue Ʒiftes to oþere men. 
And som tyme by þefte 
and som tyme by opoun wronges 
suche men 
ouersetteþ 
and spoylen oþer men 
for to do workes of largenesse. 
Þanne þeyƷ suche men cheese a good ende, 
Ʒit þei comen not riƷtfulliche to þat ende. 
Þanne [a] ‡signeth 
not in þe ende noþer in þe entencioun 
but he signeth in þe wey 
and in þe manere of comynge to þe ende 
þat þei desiren. 
Þerfore þei suche men ben 
in sum manere wise liberal, 
Ʒit þey schulde not be cleped parfit liberale; 
for a parfite vertue schal 
not onliche chese a good ende, 
but he schal also come to þat ende 
in riƷtful maner wise. 
Þanne vs nedeþ vertues moral, 
for þerby we chesen to vs a good ende; 
and vs nedeþ prudencia, 
for þerby we maken riƷtfol resons of menes 
þat bryngeth vs to good ende. 
Þanne vertues moral most principalich chesen 
a riƷtfol ende for, 
as it is iseye, 
suche as þe tonges bien, 
suche ben þe tastes. 
Ʒif þe tonge were swithe infecte wiþ colera, 
al mete and drynke schulde seme bettre; 
and Ʒif it were swiþe infecte 
with swete fleume, 
al mete and drynke schulde seme 
som del swete. 
So suche as we ben in wille and appetite, 
suche an ende we chesen 
(as he þat is intemporat cheseth 
and Ʒeueth hym to lecherie, 
and he þat is temporate cheseth 
for his ende chastite, 
and liberal cheseth to spende, 
and auarus to spare spendyng and cost); 
wherfore vertues morale maken appetite parfit 
and chesen a riƷtful ende. 
For Ʒif we hauen good appetite 
by þilke vertues, 
we chesen to vs a goode ende; 
and prudencia principalich ordeyne[þ] riƷtful menes to come to þe ende. 
For whan we chesen vs a good ende 
by vertues moral, 
by prudencia we ben resonabliche 
avised 
of þe menes 
þat bryngen to þat ende. 
Þerfore, vi Ethicorum, 
it is iseid 
þat vertues moral chesen a good ende 
and prudencia makeþ riƷtfol doyng 
by þe whiche we comen to ‡ þat ende. 
Þanne for to speke principalliche and first, 
a vertue moral cheseth a riƷtful ende and prudencia ordeyneth 
a riƷtful wey to þat ende; 
and for þe wey is not parfit 
but it be ordeyned to good ende, 
prudencia is neuer parfit 
withoute vertues morale 
by þe whiche we chesen to vs a good ende. 
Also for neuere good ende [i]s ihad þeuliche and parfitliche 
but we come þerto by a good weye, 
we hauen neuer a vertue morale parfitliche 
withoute prudencia. 
Þanne, vi Ethicorum, circa finem, 
þe philosofer wol make suche a resoun: 
he þat hath parfitliche eny vertue moral 
hath parfit prudencia, 
and he þat hath parfit prudencia 
hath ech vertue. 
Þan he þat hath eny vertue hath eche vertue; 
þan vertues moral and prudencia 
ben so connexed 
þat no man is good bi vertues morale 
but he be prudens, 
þat is redy. 
Þan for a vertue moral 
is good habite 
and cheseþ 
and makeþ hym parfite 
þat hath hym 
and makeþ his worke goode, 
for to chese wel and to doo good work, 
it suffiseth not to chese a good ende 
but me come to 
þat ende by a good wey. 
Þe vertue moral by þe whiche we chesen to vs a good ende 
may not be withoute prudencia 
by þe whiche we may come riƷfulliche to þat ende. 
Also prudencia may not be withoute vertue moral. 
And prudencia and industria ben diuers 
and þe philosofer meneþ 
þat industra hatte dyinotica, 
and he is clepid deinos and industris 
þat can for eche ende 
þat is ichose to fynde weyes 
for to come sone to þat ende. 
Þerfore he þat is intemporate and vicious 
may be industris and deinos, 
so þat he can bythenke hym of weyes 
by þe whiche he may come to dedes of lecherie 
and to do foule doyng 
þat he cheseth for likynge ende. 
But no | man is yclepid prudens 
but he kunne fynde good weyes 
to come to a good end. 
Þanne he þat findyth goode weys to come to a good ende 
is not prudens 
withoute vertuis moral 
by þe whiche we chesen to vs a good ende. 
But sum man wol mene þat a vertue morale 
may not be wiþoute prudencia 
so þat eche good man is prudens, 
and aƷenward; 
natheles it nedeth not þat he 
þat hath oon vertue parfitliche 
haue alle vertues moral parfitliche, for a man may haue parfit temporancia and prudencia 
as it serueth to temporancia 
and not haue oþere vertues 
noþer prudencia 
as it serueth to oþere vertues. 
Þan þis man may be parfitliche temporate, 
and not fortys but ferful, 
noþer large of Ʒiftes but a chynche. 
But þis may not stonde, 
for no man may be parfitlich temporate 
but he be fortis and large 
and but he haue oþere vertues. 
Also no man may haue sum vertue 
but he haue al vertues. 
For he is parfitƷliche temporate 
þat doþ 
in no wise dedes of lecherie aƷenst resoun. 
Wherfore, 
Ʒif he is ferfol, 
þei hym like not dedes of lecherie for hemsilf, 
Ʒut to flee and voide betyng and maymyng 
oþer deþ, 
he wolde assente to do dedes of lecherie. 
Also, 
thei he be auarus 
and sette his ende 
and his entent to haue money, 
on caas þei workes of lecherie 
plese hym not of hemself, 
Ʒit Ʒif a myte winne moneye 
þat he loueth as his good ende, 
he rouƷt not for to do lecherie. 
Þanne vnparfitliche on vertue 
may be wiþoute oþere vertues, 
but compleet and parfitliche 
it may not be in none wise. 
Wherfore Ʒif it is semeliche þat kynges and princes be as it were half goddes 
and haue parfit vertues, 
it is semelich to hem to haue al vertues, 
for on vertue may not be parfit withoute oþere vertues. 
| Ʒit it is spedful to kynges and princes, 
for þei mowe not excuse hemsilf by defaute 
o[þer] lakke of outward good, 
to haue al vertues 
not onliche in nygh disposicioun 
but also in parfitnesse and dede. 
Som man may be pore and parfit – <magnificus> – 
<and for lacke and defaute>, 
alþei he make not grete workes, 
for he hath not wherof noþer wherwith to do gret coste and spendyng. 
But a kyng may neuere be parfit 
but he do grete workes 
and be parfit in alle vertues. Chapter XXXII 
Ʒyf we taken besiliche hede 
of þe philosofres wordes, 
vii Ethicorum, 
we may distingwe foure grees of euel 
and foure grees of good. 
For euele men ben in foure manere gree, 
for som ben molles 
and som incontinent 
and som intemporate and som bien bestial. 
Also good men ben in foure maner degre, 
for some ben perseueraunt and somme continent 
and som temporate and somme diuini, 
swithe good. And þei bien icleped molles 
þat fallen for a litel passioun oþer for a litel temptacioun 
as þe name molle tokneþ; 
for in libro De Generacione þe philosofer seith þat molle, nesche, 
is sone ouercome. 
Þerfore as þe philosofer meneth þey bien molles, nesche, 
þat wol not traueylle, 
but þey ben to delicate; 
for as it is iseid, 
vii Ethicorum, 
delicial likynge 
is a certeyn mollicies, neschenesse; 
and suche men wolle suffre no difficulte 
but fallen anon 
as þei ben tempted. 
In þe oþere gree ben incontinent men and þes ben distingued 
fro þe firste, 
for he þat is mollis may soffre no temptacioun ne difficulte. 
And he þat is incontinent suffreth temptacioun 
and þat insufficientliche and fayleth; 
and continere, 
as þe word tokeneth, 
is to mene to holde hymself aƷenst anoþer. 
| But incontinere is auentryng 
in temptacioun oþer 
in fiƷtyng and haue nouƷt myƷt 
to hold itsilf 
but to faille. 
In þe þridde degree ben intemporat men, 
for he is intemporat 
þat not onliche falleþ 
by temptacioun 
but also it is likynge to hym to mysdo. 
But he þat is incontinent 
and he þat is mollis 
hauen not likynge 
in euel doynge and cheseth on and doþ anoþer. 
━For┐ whan thei ben not itempted ‡ 
boþe he þat is incontinent 
and he þat is mollis 
cheseth to do wel 
and cheseth also goode lawes 
and fallen 
whan þei ben tempted 
and holden none of thilke lawes. 
And þe philosofer likneth suche men to men 
þat wolde goo rigtsomes; 
and for þe body is dissolued 
and senewes and iunttes islaked, 
þey mowe not rewle þe body 
and goþ þerfore leftsomes 
whan he wold goo rigtsome. 
So he þat is mollis 
and he þat is incontinent 
casten to do wel and to goo riƷtsome; 
but for þe potencial vertues of þe saule ben dissolute and islaked 
and not ireuled 
by þe ordre of resoun, 
þerfore þei gon not riƷtsome 
but fallen and gon liftsome. 
But he þat is mollis falleþ 
oþer wise þan he þat is injcontinent, 
for he þat is mollus falliþ 
with a litil temptacioun 
and he þat is incontinent falliþ 
with grettere temptacioun; 
but he þat is intemporat is worse þan he þat is incontinent 
oþer mollis 
for he is so ivsed to yuel 
þat it is likynge to hym to do yeuel. 
In þe ferþe degre beþe þei þat ben bestial; 
and beþ worse þan þei þat beþ intemporate, 
for þei þat beþ bestial done euil passing þe maner of mankinde. 
For þe bestial man doþ doingge 
þat is orrible to kinde; 
for some in strange contreys 
eten manis flesch 
and drynken manis blood, 
and suche doynge may not come 
but of bestialtee. 
And, vii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer rekeneth many suche bestialtees 
and seith þat þer was a | womman with child 
and myƷt nouƷt be deliuered of childe 
at here owne wille and took so greet sorowe þerfore 
þat sche fil in so greet bestialte 
þat sche wolde slitte alle wymmen þat were wiþ childe; 
and so for he myƷte not be deliuered of childe, 
schu wolde þat no womman scholde þerafter be deliuered of childe. 
Also, 
as he seith, 
aboute a certeyn ile of þe see, 
as it were Pontus, 
were þat tyme certeyn men so bestial 
þat þei ete raw flesche 
and deuoured mannis flesch; 
and Ʒut worse, 
for þei lynede here owne children 
to make festes wiþ ham. 
And so Ʒif a man wolde make anoþer a feste, 
Ʒif his awne sone 
were not at home, 
he wolde borwe his neiƷbores sone 
and araye hym to be iƷete in þe feste; 
and byhoteth whanne his neiƷbore wol make a feste, 
he wolde Ʒeue his owne sone 
to be arayed 
and iƷete in þe feste. 
Also, 
as he seith, 
aboute þe contree at Phalarun 
dwelled bestial men 
þat sacrefied here owne modrys 
and ete lyuours of men. 
Þanne bestial men 
doþ euel passyng þe manere of mankynde. 
For it is ispoke of foure manere of euel men, 
it is to spekyng of foure maner of good men; 
for as some euil men 
ben molles, nesche, 
and fallen for a litel temptacioun, 
so som good men ben perseuerent and stondeþ and falleþ not 
for a litel temptacion. 
And þan for to speke of perseuerancia 
as þe philosofer spekeþ þerof, 
perseuerancia is not ellis 
but a certeyn good disposicioun contrarie to mollicies, neschenesse. 
Þanne in þe firste degree 
it ben þay þat ben perseuerant. 
And in þe seconde degree it bien þay 
þat ben contynent, 
for it is more to be continent 
þan to be perseuerant. 
For he þat is not tempted, 
oþer litel itempted 
and falleþ not, 
is perseuerant; 
but he is not continent 
but he be strongliche ytempted 
and ouercome þe temptacioun, 
for no man is continent 
but he holde hymself stedefast aƷenst tempta|cioun. 
Þerfore, vii Ethicorum, 
it is iseide 
þat continencia 
is bettre þan perseuerancia. 
In þe þridde gree of good men 
ben þey þat ben temporat. 
For ‡oon is icleped temporat 
þat not oonliche is perseuerant 
in litel temptacioun, 
as þei þat ben perseuerant doun, 
oþer stonden stedefast aƷenst strong temptacioun, 
[as þei þat ben continent 
doun,] 
but þei þat ben so ichasted 
in þe appetite and hauen so moderat temptacioun 
as þei a felid no strif of temptacioun, 
but it is likyng to hem to do wel; 
þanne as perseuerancia is contrarie to mollicies, 
and continencia to incontinencia, 
so temporancia is contrarie to intemporancia. 
For as it is likyng to hem 
þat ben intemporate to do euel, 
so it is likyng to hem 
þat ben temporate to do wel. 
And in þe ferþe 
and cheef degree of gode men 
ben þei 
þat ben icleped diuini. 
For as som men ben bestial 
and eue[l]e passynge þe manere of mankynde, 
so som bien as it were diuini 
and ben goode passyng þe manere of mankynde. 
Þerfore, vii Ethicorum, circa principium, 
þe philosofre seith þat Homerus speketh of Ector 
and seith þat his fader Priamus seide of hym 
þat he was ful good 
and þerfore a semede not þe childe of a man 
þat scholde deyge 
but þe child of god. 
And þe vertue 
by þe whiche a man is good passynge 
þe manere of mankynde 
is cleped of þe philosofer eroyca, 
þat is principal lady vertu. 
Þanne hereby it is iknowe 
þat Ʒif kynges and princes schal be riƷtfulliche lordes, 
it is not inowe to hem to forsake al grees of euel men 
as þat þei be not molles, 
nesche, noþer incontinent 
noþer intemporat noþer bestiale 
but hem nedeþ be in þe cheef degree of good men. 
For who þat desiren to be lord and prince of oþere men 
nedeth to haue þat vertue 
þat is prince and lady of oþer vertues. 
And þei þat hauen þis vertue ben good | 
passynge þe manere of oþere men 
and ben as it were godische men. 
Þanne it is semeliche 
þat kynges and princes be in þis gree. 
And Ʒif seculer princes schulde be in þis degree 
and so good and parfite, 
princes of Holi Chirche scholde be þat schal be do 
vpon þe dom of men 
þat ben prudent, wise and redy. Chapter XXXIII Bothe Macrobius and Plotinus distingwen foure degrees of vertues, 
for som ben politice and som purgatory 
and somme purgati animi and some exemplares. 
[And som saye vertues ben exemplares] in God. 
And politik vertues ben vertues igete by good vsages and þewes 
by þe whiche vertues men beren hem wel 
in nedes of mankynde; 
but þe vertues purgatorie, 
þat ben vertues of þe saule þat is purget, 
‡ cometh of certeyn Ʒiftes of God 
by þe whiche vertues man bereth hym wel 
in worschip and seruice of God. 
In worschep and seruice of God is double gree, 
for somme comen toward þe liknesse of God 
and suche hauen vertues purgatorie; 
and som hauen in som maner wise 
þis liknesse of God, 
and suche hauen þe vertues 
þat ben icleped virtutes purgati animi, 
of a purged soule. 
Þei þese speken †wordes† in hemsilf, 
it semeth not þat þei comen to þe moenyng of hem 
þat speken of vertues in þis wise. 
For philosofres speken 
not but of vertues 
þat ben igete by goode vsages 
and þewe and setten not vertues 
þat comen of suche a special Ʒift of God; 
þanne alle vertues þat þey setten comen 
as he seyde of good vsage 
and doyng of mankynde. 
Þanne folwynge þe weye of þe philosofres, 
we may saye þat as þe[r] ben diuerse grees of gode men, 
so þer ben diuerse manere vertues, 
so þat a man is more excellentliche good 
so he hath more excellent gree of vertue. 
For as þe philosofer setteþ foure grees | of good men, 
as it is iseid 
in þe chapitre tofore 
(for he seith þat som ben perseuerant 
and somme continent 
and som temporate and som diuinis, 
passynge þe manere of goodnesse and of mankynde), 
so we may distyngwe foure ordres of virtues, 
so þat we Ʒeuen to eche degree of good men 
his owne ordres of vertues. 
Þanne we schal seie þat þei þat ben perseuerant 
hauen vertues politik, 
and þei þat ben continent 
hauen vertues purgatorie, 
and þei þat ben temporat 
hauen þe vertues purgati animi, 
of a purged soule, 
but þei þat ben diuini 
hauen þe vertue þat passen aboue dedes and thinges. 
Wherfore as diuini ben bettre þan temporate, 
and temporate beter þan continent, 
and continent bettre þan perseuerant, 
so þe vertues exemplaris passen 
þe vertues purgati animi, 
and þe vertues purgati animi passen þe vertues purgatorie, 
and þe vertues purgatorie passen þe vertues politik. 
And þat þese manere vertues schulde be iordeyned 
to þe forseid degrees of good men 
it is ipreued by Plotenus 
þat seith 
þat þe firste, vertues politik, 
neicheþ and bryngeþ to mene. 
Þe seconde, purgatorie, 
doþ awey vnhoneste. 
Þe þridde, 
þe vertues purgati animi, 
forgeteth vnhoneste. 
Þe ferþe, exemplaris, 
by cause of thilke vertues it is not laweful 
to nempne eny foule thing. 
Wherfore it is wel iseid 
þat þei þat ben perseuerant hauen vertues politik; 
for, 
as it isiseide, 
perseuerancia is contrarie tomollicies, neschenesse, and it suffiseth 
for a man to be perseuerant 
þat he holde hym in þe mene. 
Þanne þe vertues 
þat is pollitik disposen þe inwit to do wel 
and bryngeth þe inwit to mene, 
and suche vertues longen to hem 
þat ben perseuerant. 
Þanne suche vertues 
ben lest among oþere vertues; 
and for to speke of perseuerancia, 
as þe philosofer spekeþ | þerof, 
þei þat ben perseuerantes 
ben in þe lowest degree of gode men. 
Þan suche vertues longen to hem 
þat ben perseuerant. 
But þe vertues purgatorie longon to hem 
þat ben continent. 
For þerby a man is continent Ʒif he holdeþ hymself 
fro sencible delectaciouns and likyng, 
for continent men withstonden temptacion 
and fiƷtten] þere aƷen, 
and þe name þerof, 
ouercomynge suche temptacioun. 
And þair likynge is to wiþdrawe 
þerfrom and forsake hem. 
Þerfore it is iseid 
þat þe vertues purgatorie longen to hem 
þat ben continent 
and þe offis of suche vertues 
is to wiþdrawe vs fram inmoderate passions and likyng. 
And þe vertues þat ben icleped virtutes purgati animi longen to hem 
þat ben temporate, 
for suche vertues wiþdrawen vs not but maken vs 
as þowƷ it were 
to forƷete suche delectacioun and likynge; for he þat is temporat 
haþ appetite so ipurged 
þat it is with hym 
as he felede no strif 
but forƷeteth inmoderat passiouns and doun wel wiþ som manere †difficulte†. 
Þanne it is wel iseid 
þat suche oon haþ þe vertues 
þat ben icleped virtutes purgati animi 
and maken hym forƷete inmoderate passions, 
for his þought and his inwit is purged and ichasted so 
þat he reccheth not of suche passions. 
Þe ferþe manere vertues, 
þat ben icleped exemplares, 
may longe to men 
þat ben icleped diuini, godlich men, 
for suche men scholde ben so parfit 
þat he schold be reule 
and ensample of oþere men. 
Þanne þe firste 
þat was purposed 
in þe bygynnyng of þe chapitre is declared: 
for it is declared 
þer ben diuers grees of vertues, 
and it is no difficulte to declare þe secunde 
and to schewe what vertues kynges and princes 
scholde haue Ʒif þe wordes 
þat ben iseid 
ben wel vnderstonde. 
For it is seid tofore 
þat it is not inow for kynges 
and princes to be perseuerant, 
| continent, and temporate 
but þei schulde be in som wise diuinos, goddysch. 
Þanne þe vertues 
þat longeþ 
to hem may be cleped exemplares for þei schulde be reule 
and ensample of oþere. 
For kynges and princes schulde be good so 
þat eueriche of here 
sugettes miƷte take ensample of lyuynge 
and knowe his owne defaute seyenge þe parfitnesse 
and þe lyuynge of þe prince. 
Wherfore kynges and princes schulde hate nouƷt oonliche 
to do vile dedes 
but also to speke 
and to huyre foule wordes and spekyng. 
Þanne it longeþ wel to hem 
to haue vertues exemplares, 
by þe whiche, 
as Plotinus seith, 
it is forbode to speke foule wordes and tales. 
But for no man 
may be so good withoute special grace and help of God, 
þe more kynges and princes 
scholde be excellent passyng oþere men, 
þe more besilich and hertliche he scholde prayƷe and beseche grace and helpe of God. 
Þanne [he]rin þe pruyde of philosofres is atent 
þat wolde mene 
þat we may 
by pure kyndeliche doynge 
forsake al euel, 
and come to parfite goodnesse. Chapter XXXIV 
It is iseid tofore hond þat, 
þei for to speke largeliche of vertues 
eche disposicioun of þe soule 
may be icleped a vertu, 
nathales sum good disposicioun 
is more anexed and helpyng to vertues and disposyng 
þerto þanne it is a vertue. 
Al[s]o som good disposicioun 
is not verreiliche a vertue 
but it is som what aboue a vertue. 
But how þat scholde be it 
is not Ʒit ipreued for þei ben not Ʒut declared 
by þe whiche 
al þis schal be iknowe. 
But Ʒif þis þat is iseide is iknowe, 
it is no difficulte to schewe 
in som wise how þe thinges stonden. 
For eubulia and synosis ‡ ben vertues of consaillyng and of demyng, 
for to speke largeliche of vertues. 
Þerfore, | vi Ethicorum, 
þe philosofre clepeth hem virtutes. 
But for to speke of vertues 
as we speken here of vertues, 
eubulia and sinosis failen 
in som wise of þe reson of vertue. 
For as it is iseid, 
ii Ethicorum, 
þat it longeth to a vertue first to haue connynge 
and þanne chesynge 
and þe þridde to worche stedfastlich withoute chaunge, 
wherfore for eubulia consaileþ 
and synosis demeth 
and prudencia commaundeþ 
to do werkes stedefastlich 
after þe consaile and dome, 
prudencia is ner to þe work 
and is raþer and haþ more reson of vertue 
þan eubulia and synosis 
þat consailleth and demeth. 
Þanne þilke twey vertues 
ben more resonabliche icleped helpynge and seruynge to vertues 
þan be icleped vertues. 
Þanne it is wel iseid 
þat som good disposicions 
helpeth and ben anexed to vertues; 
but som desposen to vertues 
as perseuerancia and continencia. 
For continencia is not proprelich a vertue, 
for to þe vertues 
man 
it is likynge to do wel; 
for þeiƷ he þat is continent 
folweth not passions but resoun, 
Ʒet for he is not continent 
bot for he withstondeþ passions 
by cause of þe strif 
þat he feleþ, 
it is not likyng to hym to do welle. 
Þanne while a man is continent and hath stronge passions, 
he hath not parfit vse of resoun and of vertue. 
Natheless ouercomynge þulke passiouns 
he is disposed to be vertuous. 
Wherfore þei continencia 
may be cleped a vertue 
for to speke largeliche of vertues, 
Ʒit it semeth more 
þat it is a disposicioun to vertue 
þanne it semeth a vertue. 
But for continencia 
is betere þan perseuerancia 
(for to speke of perseuerancia 
as þe philosofer speketh þerof), 
perseuerancia failleth of þe resoun 
of þe vertue 
and is þerfore not a vertue 
but a disposicioun to vertue 
oþer som condicioun of a vertue. 
[To] declare in what wise perseuerancia 
is a disposicioun to a vertue 
and in what whise it is a condicioun | of a vertue 
it longeth not to þis tretis. 
But it is inow 
at þis tyme to wite and to knowe 
þat for to speke of perseuerancia, 
as we speketh tofore 
and as þe philosofer spekeþ þerof, 
perseuerancia is a certeyn disposicioun to a vertue. 
And ‡ þe vertue eroyca, 
þat we may clepe a godlich vertue, 
is more verreylich aboue vertue 
þanne it is a vertue. 
Þerfore, vii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer speketh of þis vertue 
and seith þat it is not a vertue but it is more worschepful þan a vertue. 
Þanne for prudencia and iusticia 
and oþere of þe whiche we hauen itreted tofore [ben vertues], 
þe vertues of consaille and of doom 
ben anexed to vertues 
and to prudencia, 
and continencia and perseuerancia 
ben disposicions to vertues, 
and eroyca is aboue vertues, 
it is wel iseid 
þat some goode disposicions ben vertues 
and somme ben anexed to vertues 
and somme disposed to vertues 
and somme ben aboue vertues. 
Þanne þat kynges and princes 
may haue goode disposicions 
of wit and of soule, 
it is semelich 
þat he knowe þese maneres good disposicions. Book I Part III DOI: 10.4324/9781315861739-51 
How manye ben þe passions of þe soule 
and how þe nombre þerof schal be take. 
Whiche of þe forsaide passions 
ben raþer 
and whiche ben latter 
and whiche hauen ordre togedres. 
How kynges and princes schulde haue hemself 
in wrathe and in loue. 
How and in what thinges kynges and princes schulde desire and hate. 
How kynges and princes schulde haue hem 
in trist and hope, 
in ío wanhope and dispeir. 
How kynges and princes schulde haue hemself 
in hardinesse and drede. 
How ira and odium ben diuerse 
and how kynges and princes schulde haue hemsilf 
in ira, wrethe, 
and in þe contrarie þerof. 
How kynges and princes scholde haue | hemself in likynge and in sorowe. 
How somme of thes passions ben more principale 
and somme lasse principale. 
How þe passions of the soule ben reducte to oþer passions. 
Whiche of þe forseide passions 
ben to preysynge 
and whiche ben to blamyng 
and how kynges and princes schulde haue hemself in þulke passions. Chapter I Twey partees of þis werk ben isped, 
for it is ischewed 
wherinne kynges and princes scholde sette here ende 
and in what wise hem neden to be vertuous. 
Now it is to tretyng of þe þridde partie 
of þis firste book 
declaryng what passions 
and what meuynges of þe soule kynges 
and princes scholde folwy. 
But þis may not be iknowe 
but we knowe first 
how manye suche passions þer ben, 
and whiche þerof ben more principale þan oþere, 
and whiche ben to preysyng 
and whiche ben to blamynge. 
Þerfore of þes passions we schul firste trete 
and take þe nombre of hem. 
As we seide þat þer ben twelf vertues, 
so we may saye 
þat þer ben twelf passions 
as amor (loue), odium (hate), desire, abhominacioun, delectacioun, sorwe, hope, desperacio, drede, hardinesse, wrethe, mansuetudo. 
And tofore mansuetudo 
was acounted among vertues 
but þat was for scarsete of names 
as þe philosofer seith, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
for it semeth þat mansuetudo 
is properliche þe name of þe passioun 
þat is contrarie to wrethe. 
But for þer is a certeyn vertue 
bytwene wrethe and inirascibilite, 
and for we haue no propre name 
for þat vertue, we clepen it mansuetudo 
by þe name of þe passion; 
for þat vertue accordeþ more wiþ þat passioun [þat] hatte mansuetudo <‡> 
[þan wiþ wrethe. 
Mansuetudo] is a name equiuocum, 
þe name of twey | thinges, 
for it is þe name of þe vertue 
and of þe passioun 
þat is contrarie to wrethe. 
And who þat wolde traueille myƷt fynde 
for eche a propre name; 
but while þe menynge is iknowe, 
of þe wordes it is litel charge. 
For þe passions ben rekened, 
þe nombre of hem may be take in þis wise, 
for þe passions ben proprelich in þe appetit sencitif. 
And in þe intellectyf 
ben no suche passions, 
for þe appetit intellectif 
is not bodelich vertue noþer ipigt in bodilich leme. 
Þan as we speken here of passions, 
eche passion is in þe appetite sencitif. 
And as it is iseid clerliche tofore, 
þe appetite sencitif 
is deuided 
and haþ ii parties, 
þat on hat irascibilis 
and þe oþer concupiscibilis. 
Þan þe forsaid passions 
as þei ben destingwed, 
þe firste sexe, 
as amor (loue), odium (hate), desiderium, abhominacio, delectacio, and tristicia, 
longeth to þe concupiscible 
and oþer sexe 
to þe irascible. 
And þe nombre of þe passions concupiscible may be take in þis wise, 
for eche passion and meuyng of þe soule 
þat longeth to þe concupiscible is itake 
in comparisoun to good oþer euel. 
In comparisoun to good in þre manere wise, 
for in comparisoun to good 
by þe concupiscible 
we hauen thre manere of passions: 
for whan we knowen first 
þat is good, 
it pleseth vs; 
and þanne we fonden to come þerto; 
þe þridde, 
whanne we hauen it iwonne, 
þanne we holden vs apayed þerwiþ. 
Þanne whanne thing 
þat is good pleseth vs, 
we hauen loue; 
and [whanne] we fonden to come þerto, 
we hauen desire; 
and whanne we holden vs apaied þerwith, 
we holden vs apayed 
and hauen ioye and likyng. 
Þanne þes þre passions, amor, desiderium, and delectacio, 
ben itake in comparisoun to good; 
and þes oþer þre passions, 
odium (hate), abhominacio (abhominacioun), 
and tristicia (sorwe), 
ben itake in comparisoun to euel. 
For whan euel disp[le]sen vs, 
| þanne we hauen odium (hate); 
and whanne we fonden and forsaken it, 
þanne we hauen abhominacioun; 
and whanne we hauen euel oþer harme, 
þanne we hauen tristicia (sorwe). 
For it is iknowe how þe passions 
of þe concupiscible ben itake, 
it is to wetyng how þe passioun 
of þe irascible ben itake. 
For þes passions ben diuers: 
for þe passions of þe concupiscible hauen comparisoun to good 
oþer to euel 
for it is good oþer euel, 
but þe passions of þe irascible hauen comparisoun to good 
oþer euel 
for it is greet and wiþ difficulte. 
Þanne suche passions 
ben itake 
in comparisoun to good oþer euel. 
Ʒif þei ben itake in comparisoun to good, 
þat is in twey manere wise: 
oþer forwefondeth tocome þerto, 
and so isspes (hope), 
forhope is not elles 
but fonde 
for to come 
to sum greet good wiþ difficulte; 
þanne in comparisoun to good, 
for it is good, 
þer may be loue oþer desire and delectacioun. 
But hope is not in comparisoun to good 
but it be greet and wiþ difficulte; 
wherfore Ʒif we stondeþ to come 
to greet good with difficulte, 
þanne is hope. 
But Ʒif we faillen of suche good, 
þanne is desperacio (wanhope). 
Þan hope and despeire ben itake 
in comparisoun to good, 
and oþer passions of irascible ben itake 
in comparisoun to euel. 
For we may take hede of euel 
in twey maner wise: 
for it is to comynge oþer it is present. 
Ʒif we take hede þerto for it is to comynge, 
þat it is in twey maner wise: 
oþer we aventreth þer vppoun, 
an[d] so is hardinesse, 
[o]þer we voyden and fleen it, 
and so is drede. 
And Ʒif þe euel is present 
þat is in twey maner wise: 
oþer we arisen to take wreche 
of þat euel and harme, 
and so is ira, 
wrethe, 
oþer we leuen to take wreche, 
and so is mansuetudo. 
Þanne for þe passioun 
may not be dyuers 
in [m]o manere wise, 
oure meuynges and | strengþes and affeccions 
may not in mo maneres varie. 
Þanne in alle ben twelf passions, sexe in concupiscible and sex in þe irascible; 
of þe whiche al we hauen itreted diffuseliche in rethorik it suffiseth heere to passe liƷtliche. Chapter II 
For no man may rule himself wel 
but he knowe whaat passions 
he scholde voide 
and what passions he scholde folwy, 
and in þes firste book 
we þenketh to termine of manis owne reulyng, 
it is to wetynge how many passions 
þer ben 
and what ordre þei hauen eche to oþer 
and whiche ben more principal 
and whiche ben lasse principal and how oon passioun is reducte to anoþer. 
For by al þis þe kynde of þe passiouns 
is þe betre iknowe; 
and if þat kynde is iknowe, 
we knowen what passions ben goode 
and what passions ben euel 
and whiche ben to folwyng 
and whiche ben to voydynge. 
Þanne for it is iknowe how many passions 
þer ben 
and how þe nombre þerof is itake, 
it is to wetyng what ordre þey hauen eche to oþere. 
And þe ordre of hem 
may be itake 
in twey maner wise: 
by oon and oon or by twyne and tweyne. 
For to take þis ordre by tweyne and tweyne we may saye 
þat amor (loue) and odium (hate) 
ben þe firste passions. 
In þe seconde degree ben desiderium and abhominacio; 
in þe þridde degree ben hope and despeire; 
and in þe ferþe degree, drede and hardinesse; 
and in þe fifte degree 
ben wreth and mansuetudo; 
and delectacio and sorwe 
ben þe laste passiouns. 
For delectacioun and sorwe folweth to al oþere passions, 
for in al manere passioun 
a man hath delectacioun oþer sorwe. 
Þerfore þis twey passiouns 
ben isette after al oþere passiouns. 
And amor and odium ben þe | firste of alle. 
For as delectacioun and sorwe 
folweth to al oþere passions, 
for of al oþere passions 
cometh delectacioun oþer sorwe, 
so of loue oþer of hate comen oþer passions 
for al oþere passions springen and comen of loue 
oþer of hate. 
For eche man 
þat is imeued 
oþer istered 
by eny passiouns 
is so imeued oþer istered 
for he loueth oþer for he hateth. 
And after loue and hate next ben desire and habominacioun, 
for desire folweth nex to loue. 
For whan [w]e loueth eny thing, 
oþer we desiren to haue it, 
oþer Ʒif we hauen it, 
we desiren to saue it in hauynge. 
And abhominacioun folweth next to hate for anon 
as we haten a þyng, 
we hauen abhominacioun þerof. 
Wherfore as loue and hate ben þe firste passiouns, 
so desiderium and abhominacio ben þe seconde. 
And in þe þridde place 
ben hope and despeire, 
for whan hope and despeire ben itake in comparisoun to good, 
þanne he goþ tofore drede and hardinesse and tofore wrethe and mansuetudo 
þat bien itake 
in comparisoun to yuel. 
And drede and hardinesse gon tofore 
wrethe and mansuetudo 
þat ben itake 
in comparisoun to euel and harme þat is present. Þan it is pleyneliche iknowe 
þat þe forsayde passyons hauen ordre Ʒif þei ben itake tweye and tweye. 
And Ʒif þei ben itake oon and oon, 
he schal be iordeyned in þis wise: 
loue is tofore hate, 
desiderium tofore abhominacioun, 
hope tofore despeire, 
drede tofore hardynesse, 
wrethe tofore mansuetudo, 
delectacioun tofore sorwe. 
And loue is tofore hate, 
for alwey þe passioun 
þat is itake in comparisoun to good, 
for it is suche, 
þat is tofore þe passioun 
þat is itake in comparisoun to euele. 
For þe appetite first 
and principalliche fondeþ to haue good. 
And Ʒif it forsaketh euel, | þat is by þe consequent folwynge 
for forsakynge of euel hat[h] resoun of good. 
Þanne loue is þe firste sterynge 
and þe firste passyon 
for hate cometh of loue; 
for but we louede som þyng, 
we scholde no thyng 
hate noþer haue abhominacioun of no thing. 
For by cause þat we louen good and riƷtwisnesse, 
we haten theues and mysdoers 
and hauen abhominacioun of hem. 
And desiderium þat lenyeth to loue 
is tofore abhominacioun 
þat lenyeth to hate, 
and hope is tofore dispeire. 
For 3if þe firste thing 
þat is wilned is good 
and al þat is iwilned is iwilned for cause of goode, 
þanne þe passioun 
þat most iuneth vs to good 
by cause of good 
is tofore oþere passiouns. 
And for to wilne good is iunynge to good, 
and betere it is to be iuned to good 
þanne faille þerof, 
þanne hope by þe whiche we wilneth 
and fondeþ to haue good 
is tofore despeire 
by þe whiche we faillen of good. 
And drede is tofore hardinesse 
for as by cause 
þat þe appetite wilneth principalliche 
and fondeþ to haue good, 
þerfore þe passioun 
þat fondeth to haue good 
is tofore þe passioun 
þat failleth of good. 
So for forsakynge of euel is good, 
þerfore drede by þe whiche we forsaketh euel 
is tofore audacia 
by þe whiche we auntreth and reseth on euel. 
And among passions wreþ is tofore mansuetudo, 
for mansuetudo is not proprelich a passioun 
but it is more verreyliche faillyng of passioun; 
þerfore among passions 
wrethe is byfore mansuetudo. 
And whether in sum oþere manere wise mansuetudo 
be byfore 
wrethe it longeth not to þis doynge to trete. 
And delectacioun þat is in comparisoun to good 
is tofore sorwe 
þat is in comparisoun to euel. 
Þanne it is iseie how many passions 
þer ben and iknowe | by þis þat is iseid 
how þei ben iordeyned togeders. 
And in som wise 
and by þe liknesse 
þe kynde of passions 
is iknowe to vs 
and þerby we may knowe in som wise 
how þe forseide passions 
scholde ben folwede oþer forsake. 
And þe more euel and harme 
may come of passions of kynges and of princes 
and þe more excellent [good] 
may be put of by here passions, 
þe more nede it is 
þat kynges and princes knowe þe distinccioun 
and kynde of þes passiouns. 
But þis schal be treted more diffuselich heere after. Chapter III 
For passions maketh diuersete in reulyng 
and in oure leuyng, 
it is nedfol to declare how we schul haue vsself in passions. 
Panne it was nedfol to rekene al þe passions 
þat we myƷt knowe þe nombre of passions 
of þe whiche we schal determyne, 
and it was nedfol to declare þe ordre þerof 
þat we myƷt knowe 
in what ordre we schulde determine þerof. 
Wherfore by cause þat loue 
and hate ben þe firste passiouns, 
firste it is to wetynge 
how it is semelich þat kynges and princes loue and hate 
and in what wise. 
And þat we declare þe name of loue, amor, 
and not onliche for it 
is propreliche a passioun 
but also as it is ifounde 
in þe appetit sencitif oþer intellectif, 
we may saye þat alway 
þe obiecte of loue is good. 
(And here it is to wetyng 
þat þe obiecte of siƷt is þyng 
þat is iseie as colour o[r] liƷt, 
and þe obecte of heryng is þyng 
þat is herd as voys and soun; 
and so þe obiecte of loue is þyng 
þat is iloued as good þyng.) Þanne þe more good a þyng is, 
þe more principaliche and þe more strongliche 
it is loued. 
And in good þat longeth to God 
and to þe comynte is more goodnesse þanne singuler good. 
Þanne eche man schal loue good 
in þat wise so 
þat he first and principalliche louye þe good | 
þat longeth to God 
and þe comyn good. 
For in þe goodnesse of God 
is þe goodnesse of eche man more þan in hymself. 
For þe goodnesse of God kepeth and saueth our goodnesse. 
And [i]f oure goodnesse, 
þat i[s o]f God, 
were anulled or destroied, wherwith scholde man oþer myƷte oþer wolde fede oþer help hymself? 
Wherfore bi cause þat no man 
wiþoute þe helpe of God 
may make hymsilf good noþer saue hymself in goodnesse, 
kynde resoun wol þat he schal loue God more þan hymself, 
for þe goodnesse of ech man cometh principallich of God 
and is more excellentliche ikept 
and isaued in God 
þan in hymself. 
And for comyn good is more 
[goodelich]e þan singuler good 
as it is iseid, primo Ethicorum, 
and for in þe comyn good singuler good is closed, 
alwey þe comune good scholde be set tofore þe singuler good. 
For we seen 
þat a partie of þe bodie putteth itself to peril 
for þe hoole body 
as þe arme putteþ itself 
to peril for þe body, 
and by kynde intysyng whanne a man seeþ and perseyueth 
þat þe membris scholde be iwounded 
oþer ihert, 
in þe whiche membris stondeþ 
sauacioun of þe body, 
to saue al þe body 
þe arme putteth itself to peril; 
so Ʒif we taken hede 
to olde tyme 
how som cite hadde lordschepe and reyned, 
þat was for þe citeseyns sparetd] 
not to put hemself 
to peril of deþ 
for þe comyn profit. And þe loue 
þat þe Romayns hadde 
to þe comyn profit made Rome a princ[ipat]e and rayne. 
Þanne in þis wise al men scholde louye so 
þat first and principalliche 
he scholde loue God 
and þe comyn profit, 
and by þe consequent folwyng, 
he schulde loue priuate and singuler good and profit. 
And þat is most semelich 
to kynges and princes, 
and þat we may declare by þre weyes. 
For as we speken 
at þis tyme, 
þe dignite of a kyng 
may be likned to þre: 
| to tyraundise, 
to þe whiche a kyng is contrarie; 
to vertues, 
by þe whiche he schulde be ihiƷt; 
and to vices, 
þe whiche he schulde forsake. 
Þe friste wey is declared 
in þis wise for, 
as it is iseid tofore 
and as þe philosofer 
preueth [in] Politic[is], 
a kyng and a tyrand ben diuerse. 
For a kyng loueth principalliche þe comune profit, 
and in louynge þe comune profit 
he loueth his owne profit; 
for Ʒif þe regne is saaf, 
þe kyng is saaf. 
But a tyraund doþ þe contrarie 
and loueth principaliche his owne profit, 
and, 
by þe consequent folwynge and by hap, 
he loueþ þe comyn profit 
wherof cometh his owne profit. 
Þanne for a kyng 
and a tyrant hauen contrarious maners, 
for þe manere of loue of a tyrauntsetteþ his awne profit 
tofore þe comyne profit 
and þe manere loue of a kyng scholde sette þe comyn profit 
tofore his owne profite; 
also for eche kyng and prince 
is in special manere Goddes seruant and a comyn persone: 
in a special manere 
it is semelich to kynges and princes 
to sette God 
and þe comyn profit 
tofore singuler profit. 
Þe seconde, 
þat is declared by consideracioun of vertues 
by þe whiche kynges and princes schulde be ihiƷt. 
For as defaute and lakke of connynge 
is worse in þe maister 
þan in þe desciple, 
for þe maister is in suche astaat 
in þe whiche he mot teche 
oþer men wit and connynge, 
so lacke and defaute of vertues 
is worse in þe kyng þan in sogettes 
for it longeth to his astaat 
to brynge 
oþer men to vertues. 
And among oþer thinges 
þat may brynge kynges to vertues, 
on is þat a loue principaliche God 
and þe comyn profit. 
For Ʒif a kyng loueth principaliche God 
and þe comyn profit, 
he schal besiliche studie 
to haue mynde of thinges þat ben apassed, 
and prouysioun and warnynge of þynges 
þat schal come, 
| and þat he be expert and waar, 
and þat he haue al 
þat it nedeth to prudencia 
by þe whiche prudencia 
he may rule his puple. 
And Ʒif he setteth þe comyn profit 
tofore singulare profit 
– þe more prudencia 
nedeþ to saue þe comyn profit 
þan nedeth to saue þe singuler profit, 
þe more he scholde studie to haue greet prudencia. 
Þanne he schulde be prudens. 
Also he schulde be iuste, riƷtfol, 
for þe comyn profit 
is most ikept 
and isaued by iusticia. 
And he schulde be magnanimus, 
for þe comyn profit 
is greet and wiþ difficulte 
and ben worthi greet honour and worschep and magnanimus 
loueth greet honour and worschep. 
And he schulde be magnificus, 
for as þe philosofer meneth, iiii Ethicorum, 
magnificencia stondeþ principaliche 
in seruice and worschep of God 
and in þe comyn profit. 
And he schal be fortis, 
for Ʒif he setteþ þe comyn profit 
byfore singulere profit, 
he spareth not to putte his owne persone to perile 
Ʒif he se þat it is spedful to þe regne. 
He schal be temporatus; 
for Ʒif his entencioun is occupied principalliche in profit of þe regne, 
he forsaketh and despiseth 
sencible and inmoderate delectacioun and likynge 
lest he be þerby ilette of besynesse and cure of þe regne. 
Þanne for to take al for oon, 
loue o[f] good of God 
and of þe comyn profit, 
þat on bryngeth to alle vertues. 
Þanne by consideracioun of vertues 
by þe whiche kynges scholde be hiƷt þei scholde principalliche loue God 
and þe comyn profit. 
Þe þridde, 
þe same is declared 
by consideracioun of vices 
þe whiche kynges schulle voyde and forsake. 
For as loue of God 
and þe comyn profit ledeþ and bryngeth to alle vertues, 
so inmoderate loue of a manis owne persone ledeþ and bryngeþ 
to alle 
vices-| for suche ben tirauntes 
and wollen folfille here owne lust and likyng and desiren singuler excellence and doun 
þerfore wrong 
to oþer men 
and stelen and robben holy thinges 
and spoilen þe poeple and vsen al vnriƷtwisnesse. 
Þerfore Valerius Maximus, 
de Dionisio Ciciliano, 
telleþ þat þis Dionisius of Cicilia, 
for he was a tiraunt and louede hymself, 
he destroyede and spoilede citees and townes 
and robbed holy places. 
For it is iseye how kynges and princes schal haue hemself in loue, 
for he schal principallich loue God 
and þe comyn profit, 
it may be sone iknowe 
how þei scholde haue hemself in hate. 
For loue is þe firste steryng 
and þe first passioun 
and þerof cometh 
eche oþer passioun; 
and Ʒif a man loueth riƷtwisnesse and trouthe, 
he hateth þeues 
þat ben contrarie to riƷtwisnesse 
and bac biters 
þat ben contrarie to treuthe 
and to sothnesse. 
And for he loueth bodilich lif, 
he dredeþ þe swerd 
þat benemeth þe lyf. 
Panne drede, 
and hate, and, schortlich, 
eche passioun 
and eche sturyng 
of þe soule springeth and cometh of loue. 
Þanne ech man schuld haue principallich 
in his entent and mynde 
what is worthi to be loued. 
For it is declared how kynges and princes scholde 
in a special manere passynge 
oþere men loue God 
and þe comyn profyt, 
þanne in a special manere passynge oþere men 
þey scholde forsake and hatie thynges 
þat ben contrarie to God 
and to þe comyn profit. 
And suche ben wrongful workes 
and dedes and despituous, 
and generalliche alle vices. 
Wherfore, 
for by cause 
þat it is þe propretee 
of hate to destroye 
and not be apaied 
but he destroye 
as it is seid, 
ii [Rethorjicorum, þanne it is semelich 
þat kynges and princes loue riƷtwisnesse and hate vices so þat he holde hemself not apaied 
but he | destroye vices. 
And men scholde not be destroyed 
and ihated for þei ben men, 
but for vices scholde be destroyed and ihated. 
Ʒif vices may not oþer wise be destroied 
noþer þe comyn profit 
may oþer wise dure 
but by destroyeng of euel doers, 
suche scholde be destroyed 
for þe comyn profit scholde not perische. 
Þanne þe more comyn persones kynges and princes ben, 
þe more þei schulde loue 
þe comyn profit 
and hatie euel doynges and dedes þat ben contrarie to þe comyn profit. Chapter IV [I]t is itreted of loue and of hate 
þat ben þe firste passions, 
and it is to tretynge 
how kynges and princes scholde haue hemself in desire and habominacioun 
þat ben þe seconde passions. 
And desire is oþere þan loue, 
and habominacioun is oþer þan hate. 
For moral doynge 
is som del liche 
to kyndeliche thinges; 
for as kyndelich bodyes 
by here owne fourmes, 
as by heuynesse and liƷtnesse, 
fondeth to come to here owne place, 
so by loue man fondeþ to come to good þat is proporcionate and acordyng to hym. 
Þanne in heuy bodyes 
oþer ÜƷte þre þynges mot be knowe: 
firste, þe heuy fourme 
oþer liƷt by þe whiche þei ben accordynge to hige places 
oþer to lowe; 
þe seconde, þe meuynge by þe whiche he cometh 
in to suche a place; 
þe þridde, 
þe abydyng and restyng 
by þe whiche he resteth in suche a place. 
And so in moral dedes and doyng, 
as it is comynliche iseide, 
suche þre mot be iknowe. 
For whan we perseyuen sum þyng 
þat is good, first, 
by loue and by sum plesance we accorden þerto; 
þe seconde, 
by desire we fonden and comen þerto; 
þe þridde, 
by dilectacioun we resten þerinne. 
Þanne loue accordeþ vs and desire meueth vs and delectacioun makeþ vs haue reste; 
and what is iseid of good 
in comparisoun to loue and to desire 
and to | delectacioun, 
as it is itouched tofore, 
schal be vnderstonde of euel 
in comparisoun to hate 
and to abhominacioun 
and to sorwe. 
As whan we louen good we accorden þerto, 
and whanne we desiren it 
we fonden to come þerto, 
and whan we hauen it 
we hauen delectacioun 
and likynge þerinne – so yuel 
þat is ihated, displesid, 
and is contrarie to oure wylle, 
and Ʒif we hauin abominacion þerof, 
we schoniþ and forsakeþ it; 
and Ʒif we hauin hit, 
we ben sori þerfore. 
And þei desire be not loue, 
Ʒit it scholde take manere and mesure of loue; 
so þei abhominacioun be not hate, 
Ʒut it schal take mesure of hate. 
And so we seeþ 
in kyndeliche þynges 
þat [þei] 
þe meuyng dounward 
be not þe fourme of an heuy body, 
Ʒut kyndeliche þe meuyng dounward takeþ mesure 
and manere of þe heuynesse 
so þat þe more heuy a body is þe more swiftliche it meueth dounward. 
Wherfore Ʒif we wol knowe how kynges and princes schulde desire thinges and haue abhominacioun þerof, 
it is to wetynge 
how þei scholde louye and hatie. 
And we seeþ 
in alle actus and dedes 
as it is preued, primo Polliticorum, 
þat þe ende is desired wiþoute mesure. 
And þynges þat bryngeth vs to þe ende ben desired 
by þe manere and mesure of þe ende, 
as a fesician and a leche fondeþ 
as moche as þei may 
to brynge in helthe most and best 
þat he may; 
for helthe in þe art and craft of fesik 
is þe principale entent as þe ende of doynge in þat art. 
And it is not here entent to Ʒeue drenches 
and blood letinge as mowche as þey mowe, 
for þanne ‡ he schulde slee þe seke; 
but it is here entent to Ʒeue drenches 
and oþere medicyns 
and lete blood 
by þe mesure of þe helthe. 
Þanne, 
for in þe craft 
and art of regnynge 
and of principate sauacioun of þe regne 
and of myƷt (power) 
and of þe principate 
is þe principal and fynal entent, 
as in art of medicine sauaci|oun of þe kyndelich body is þe principal entent, 
it is semelich to kynges and princes to sette here entent kyndeliche and principaliche to loue 
þe profit of þe regne 
and þe comyn profit. 
Wherfore Ʒif desire scholde take mesureofloue, 
principaliche kynges and princes scholde loue [þe] good staat of þe regne so 
þat þei þat ben in þe regne schulde bere hemself 
in Goddys seruyce and worschep 
and do vertues werkes and dedes and haue 
among hem loue and pees and riƷtwisnesse iholde and oþere suche 
by þe whiche principalliche and essencialliche 
þe good estaat of þe regne stondeþ. 
And he scholde desire oþer thinges 
as þei hauen ordre to þes thinges. 
Þanne he scholde desire cyuyle myƷt and power, richesse, and catel for as moche as þei mowe 
þerby chaste euel men 
and ponysche wrongful dedes 
and do suche dedes 
by þe whiche þe sauacioun of þe regne stondeþ. 
For it is iseie 
what and how kynges and princes schulde desire 
(for as he scholde loue first 
and principalliche God 
and þe comyn profit, 
he schulde loue oþere thinges 
in so moche 
as þei ben ordeyned þerto, 
so he scholde first and principalliche desire God and þe comyn profit; 
and oþere þat ben iordeyned herto ben desired by cause 
þat þei ben iordeyned þerto); 
þanne it may be sone iknowe of what thinges 
and how þei schulde haue abhominacioun. 
For principalliche thinges ‡ ben abhominable 
þat ben expresse and opounliche aƷenst God 
and þe comune profit, 
and oþere þynges ben abhominable 
by þe consequent folwynge. 
And þe more charge and besynesse þe[i] hauen in cure of þe regne 
and of þe comyn profit, 
þe more semelich it is þat kynges and princes haue suche abhomynacioun 
and suche desire. 
And whiche it ben þat kepen 
and sauen þe regne in good staat and how a kyng schulde haue hymself to þe regne, 
| it schal be declared more diffuselich in þe þridde book. Chapter V 
Whanne we determinen of þe ordre of þe passions 
of þe saule, 
we seide þat loue 
and hate ben þe firste passions, 
and desiderium and abhominacio 
ben þe secunde passions, 
and þerafter in þe þridde degre ben hope and despeire. 
Panne it is to wetynge 
how kynges and princes scholde haue hemself in hope and despeire. 
But [i]f al þat is iseid 
is clerliche vnderstonde, 
it is no difficulte to wite and to knowe how kynges and princes schulde haue hemself þerinne. 
For it is iseid tofore þat it is semelich 
þat a kyng be humilis and magnanimus; þanne, 
for humilite moderateth hope 
(for he þat is humilis knoweth his owne defaute and taketh not more hope 
and trist þan he scholde), 
and magnanimitas abateþ despeire and wanhope 
(for he þat is magnanimus taketh no despeire for difficulte of dedes), 
‡ Ʒif a kyng is humilis and magnanimus, 
he hopeth alwey and tristeth in þyng þat is to tristynge inne ‡ 
by cause of magnanimite, 
[and] he setteþ no hope and trist in þyng 
þat no trist is inne by cause of humilite. 
And we may declare in foure manere wise 
þat it is semelich 
þat kynges and princes haue hemself wel and semelich in hope and trist, 
and hope and triste in þynges 
in þe whiche he sholde haue hope and trist, 
and auentre on þynges 
on þe whiche he scholde aventre. 
For Ʒif kynggis and princis hope 
and trist in no þing 
noþer auentured in no þing, 
þan he were pusillanimus 
and tretiþ 
not þe nedis of þe regne 
as he schulde. 
As it is comynliche iseid, 
þat in hope and in trist foure 
most be iknowe by þe whiche we may argue 
þat it is semelich 
þat kynges and princes haue good hope and trist. 
For first, hope | is of good, 
for of euel is no hope but drede. 
Þ[e secondle, hope is in difficulte; 
for they in eche good 
may stonde loue and desire, 
Ʒut hope may not stonde 
but in good wiþ difficulte. 
For no man hopeth but hym seme 
that it is hard and difficulte to come 
to þe good 
þat he hopeth to haue. 
Þe þridde, hope stondeth in good þat is to comyng; 
for of good þat is present is non hope, 
þei þerof come ioye and likynge. 
Þe ferþe, hope stondeþ in good 
þat is poscible and may be; 
for inposcible good þat may not be no man hath hope but despeire. 
And þese foure – good, difficulte, to comynge, 
and poscible – scholde principaliche longe to kynges and princes. 
For by cause þat kynges Ʒeuen lawes 
(for þe philosofer meneth 
þat it longeth propreliche to kynges and princes to Ʒeue lawes), 
þerfore it is semelich 
þat thei haue hope to good. 
Also, 
for þe principal entent of a kyng 
þat Ʒeueth lawe, 
as it is iseid tofore, 
scholde be seruice and worschip of God, 
and for suche good 
is excellent and passyng good and with difficulte, 
þe entent of kynges and princes 
scholde not oonlich be set in good 
but also in excellent and passyng good. 
Also þe more þe cominte 
is þe more happis he mai haue, 
and nediþ þerfore 
þe more avisement and prouisioun and wamesses 
and þe better consaile. 
‡ Prouisioun, avisement, and warnesse is of þingis 
þat ben to cumminge 
for no man 
takiþ consaile of inpossible þingis 
þat mai not be, 
as þe philosofer meniþ, [iii] Ethicorum. 
And, vi Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer meneth þat thinges 
þat ben apassed ben inmutable and mowe not chaunge and þerfore he falleth not 
vnder counseile noþer vnder prouisioun and avisement and warnesse. 
Þat is semelich 
þat kynges and princes knowe good not onliche for it is excellent and passynge good and wiþ difficulte, 
but also for it is to comynge. 
| Also he scholde knowe and take heede 
of suche good 
for it is poscible. 
For pore men 
þat ben of [no] power and vnworthi, 
þouƷ he be [not] magnanimi 
and þeiƷ a wethdrawe hem fro som maner good 
þat is passyng excellent and wiþ difficulte, 
it semeth þat þey ben excused 
for hem lacken richesse and cyuyle myƷt 
and power 
and worthinesse of blood 
to doo suche good. 
But kynges and princes 
þat hauen worthinesse of blood, 
cyuyle myƷt and power, 
and gret faculte and richesse semeth inexcusable 
3¿f þei ben pusillanimes and trowen not þat it is poscible to hem 
to doo swiche excellent and passyng gode 
þat is worþi gret honour and worschep. 
Þan, 
for kynges and princes schulde set here entent in excellent and passyng good 
and be avised wherof good 
þat is to comynge 
and poscible to þe regne, 
it is semelich þat þei haue good hope 
and trist 
by magnanimite for þei hauen al þat it nedeth to þewe hope and trist. 
It is iseie how kynges and princes schulde haue hem wel in hope of thing 
þat is to hopynge; 
þanne it is to wetynge 
how þei schul haue hemself 
in not hopyng of thing 
þat is not to hopynge, 
for he schulde with greet besynesse 
to inquyre 
what he scholde hope 
and in what doynge he scholde auentre. 
For as by magnanimite þei scholde be redy and prest to auenture 
in excellent and passyng doynge 
and to hope 
what he scholde hoope, 
so by humilite þei scholde be moderate so 
þat þei auntren not in doynge 
þat passen here owne myƷt and strengþe and so 
þat þei hope 
not what is not to hopynge. 
And by twey weyes we may preue 
þat kynges 
and <princes schulde auenture hemself 
as in goodnesse schewyng 
to alle oþer sogettes, 
for foly hardynesse of hem myƷt destrue manye. 
And kynges and> | princes scholde not auentre in doyng 
þat passeth here owne myƷt and strengþe noþer hath more hope þan he scholde. 
Þe firste wey is itake 
by þe office of þe kyng; 
þe seconde by þe puple. 
For to hope more passyng 
þan he schulde hope 
and auenture in doynge 
þat passeth here 
myƷt and strengthe cometh of foly 
oþer of sum inmoderat passion. 
Þerfore, ii Rethoricorum, 
it is iwrete 
þat children ben alwey of good hoope in al doyng. 
Þei it be aƷenst hem 
and passinge here myƷte and strengthe, 
children hauen good hope 
and þat comet of folie, 
for þei þat ben not expert knoweth not difficulte of dedes. 
Also it may happe þat it cometh ofte [of] inmoderate passioun, 
for in children is moche hope 
þey he saye sum doyng 
þat þey may not brynge to ende. 
And so we may say 
þat dronkene men hauen more hope 
þan þei schulde, 
for þei ben hote with wyne and lese þe vse of resoun 
by dronkenesse 
and fondeth to do sum doyng 
þat þei mowe not brynge to ende. 
Þanne for þe office of kyng nedeþ and requireth man 
þat is prudent 
and not passionate 
by inmoderate passioun, 
it is semelich 
þat kynges and princes scholde not auentre in doyng <werkis> and dedes þat passen here owne myƷt and strengþe noþer hope 
what is not to hopynge. 
Þe seconde, 
þat it is semelich to hem 
by cause of þe puple: 
for comynliche he 
þat auentureth in doynge 
þat passeth his owne myƷt 
and strengþe putteþ hymself to peril. 
Ʒif it is inconuenient to putte al þe men 
and al þe regne <in subieccioun and> ━to peril┐ 
(<and ‡ þerfore it is semelich 
þat euery astat take hede þerof, 
for it is nedfol 
þat kynges and princes put hem in strengþe>), 
| ‡ kynges and princes schulde wiþ longe counseille 
and with greet besinesse and auysement bythenke 
in what doyng he schulde auenture, 
leste he take vppoun hym sum doynge 
þat passeth here owne myƷt and strengthe, 
and lest þei hopede to haue sum what þat is not to hopynge. Chapter VI The philosofre, iiii Ethicorum, 
meneth þat in þewes 
and in moral matere singuler consideracions profiteth most. 
And for thinges þat ben confuse 
and general ben most iknowe to vs, 
as it is iseid, 
primo Phisicorum, 
þerfore in þis firste book 
tretyng of maneres 
and þewes of kynges, 
we mote passe generalliche and bi figures and by liknesse; 
for in þe seconde book, 
and namliche in þe þridde, 
we schal more descende to particuler circumstaunces. 
But it is spedful to passe þes vniuersales, 
for knowleche heere of schal brynge vs to knowleche of thinges 
þat folweth. 
And in þe þridde book 
in a more particuler manere 
we schal trete of doynge of kynges; 
but it is not spedful 
to descende alle to particulers, 
for þei þat knowen þe manere of courtes, 
and namelich kynges and princes, 
knowen particuler doyng 
atte þe folle by ofte vse 
and siƷt of suche doyng. 
Wherfore Ʒif sum vniuersal lore is iöeue to hem in morale matere 
by hope of experience 
þat þei hauen in moral doyng and dedes, 
þei mowe be itauƷt 
atte þe fulle in knowleche of morale matere. 
Þanne for þis is iseide, 
sey we þat as we hauen generalliche 
and by liknesse [itauƷt kynges and princes] 
how þei scholde haue hemself 
in hope and despeyre 
þat stondeþ in good 
þat is to comynge, 
so by þe same wey we may teche hem 
how þei schulde | haue hemself in drede 
and in hardinesse 
þat stondeþ in euel 
þat is to comynge. 
And in cas som men wolde wene 
þat kynges and princes schulde neuere drede, 
for þei meneþ 
þat suche doyng 
were aƷenst þe maieste of a kyng. 
And ofte kynges hauen men 
þat tellen hem 
so and maken hem euidenses 
to be hardy 
in alle dedes 
and no thing drede. 
But suche flaters ben false, 
for he techeth þat kynges and princes schulde not be fortes; 
for as it is iseid, 
primo Magnorum Moralium, 
he þat is hardy 
in al doyng 
and dredeth no thing is not fortis 
but he is a fole. 
Þan it nediþ to wite 
in what maner wise þei schuld be ferful and hardi, 
for moderat drede 
is spedful to kingis and princis leste Jeny þingis schulde arise 
in þe londe 
and in þe regne 
þat myƷte apeire good staat þerof. 
And as it longeth to þis doyng, 
by twey weyes we may preue 
þat þe moderat drede 
is nedfol to kynges and to princes. 
Þe firste wey is itake by counseile 
þat scholde be take 
and þe seconde by dede 
þat scholde be do. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise, 
for as it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
capitulo De Timore, 
drede axeth counsaile and maketh men axe counsaile. 
Ʒif a man dredeth, 
he axeth counsaile 
how he may ascape þe euel 
and þe harme 
þat he dredeth. 
Þanne for oon hool regne 
may not be wel ireuled 
withoute greet counsaille, 
it is spedful 
þat kynges and princes haue som moderat drede 
þat þei haue occasioun to axe 
and to take good counsail. 
Þe seconde, 
we may preue þe same 
by doyng þat scholde be do. 
For it is not inow to axe 
and to take counsaile 
and deme by þe counsaile 
þat is iƷeue | 
but we do þewlich and bisiliche by þe counsaille and dome þat is iƷeue. 
And moderate drede maketh vs not onlich axe counsaille, 
but also it makiþ us werche besiliche. 
For Ʒif we hauen moderate drede, 
we werchen bisiliche and don thinges 
by þe whiche we trowen to voyde þat drede. 
Þanne it is declared 
þat kynges and princes schulde haue moderat drede; 
nathales, 
þei scholde in no wise haue inmoderat drede. 
For in inmoderate drede ben foure 
þat ben al aƷenst þe regne and aƷenste þe kyng. 
For inmoderat drede maketh a man astonied and ischronke. 
Þe seconde, 
it maketh hem to ax no counsaile. 
Þe þridde, 
it maketh hym to tremle and to quake. 
Þe ferþe, 
it maketh hym vncouenable. 
For a man whanne he dredeth 
þe blood draweth inward; 
for þe same manere 
þat we seen in men, 
we may see in hete of kyndelich body. 
For whanne men dreden in feeldes, 
anon he fleeth to castellis 
oþer to tours; 
and whanne me dredeth, 
þe heete þat is in þe ottere membris 
fleen anon in to oþere membris. 
Þerfore a man is ischronke 
and istonyed in hymself. 
Wherfore, 
Ʒif it is vnsemelich 
þat þe kyng 
þat is heed of þe regne be ischronke and astonied, 
it is vnsemelich 
þat he haue inmoderat drede. 
Þe secunde, 
þat is vnsemelich 
for inmoderate drede maketh a man not axe noþer take consaille. 
For whan a man is in inmoderate drede, 
he is al astonied, 
in agonie and strif, 
and woot not what he schal do 
and hath þerfore no mynde of counsaille. 
And Ʒif men Ʒeueth hym counsaille, 
he vnderstondeth it not for he is so astonyed. 
Wherfore Ʒif it is vnsemelich 
þat nedes and dedes of þe regne be do withoute | counsaile 
and þat þe kyng be withoute counsaille, 
it is vnsemelich þat he haue inmoderat drede. 
Þe þridde, 
inmoderat drede maketh 
a man tremle and quake. 
For by cause of drede 
þe hete passeth inward 
and þe outward membris 
abideth colde, 
þa[n] ben þe synwes ikeled 
and mowe not susteyne þe membris; 
wherfore he trembleth and quaketh. 
Þanne Ʒif it is inconuenient 
þat a kyng tremble and quake 
þat schulde be manlich and stedefast, 
it is inconuenient 
þat he haue drede inmoderate. 
Þe ferþe, 
inmoderat drede maketh 
a man vncouenable, 
for by inmoderat drede 
a man quaketh 
and is astonyed 
and inconuenable 
and woot not what he schal do. 
Þanne, for al þe regne stondeth in þe kyng, 
as in hym þat meueth, 
and abideth his hestes and commaundementes 
– Ʒif þe kyng is vncouenable 
and may not hoote and commaunde 
[for inmoderat drede], 
it is preiudicium, 
þat isdesease, 
toal þeregne. 
Wherfore Ʒif it is vnsemeliche, 
a kyng schulde not haue 
inmoderat drede. 
It is iseie how kynges schulde haue hemself in drede, 
for it is more difficulte to abate drede 
þanne moderat hardinesse 
as it is iseie tofore, 
capitulo De Fortitudine; 
it may be sone iknowe 
how þey schulde haue hemself in hardinesse, 
for þei scholde not haue inmoderate hardinesse. 
For inmoderat hardinesse maketh a man take more vppoun hym þan he scholde 
and þat is not spedful to kynges, 
for þanne þei wolde putte al þe regne to peril. 
And Ʒif a man haþ noon hardinesse in al wise, 
þat is [vnjsemelich 
for þanne he auentureth 
to no doynges and dedes. 
Þanne in alle wyse it is semelich 
þat kynges | 
and princes haue hemself moderatlich 
in hardinesse and drede. Chapter VII 
For it semeth 
þat wrethe hath most affinite with hate, 
ar we declare how kynges and princes schulde haue hemself in wreth and mansuetudo, 
it is to wetyng 
how wrethe and hate ben diuerse 
and whether of hem tweyne is worse – wraþ oþer hate inordinate. 
And þere is oon principal diuersete bitwene wrathe and hate, 
for hate is appetite and desire 
oþer wyllyng of harme withoute condicioun, 
for hate is contrarie to loue. 
And, 
as it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
it is al one to loue 
and wilne good to som man 
by cause of hymself; 
so hate is to wilne harme to som man 
by cause of hymself. 
And it is not so of wrathe, for wrathe 
is not appetite of harme in itself 
but in ordre to wreche. 
And wrethe may be diffined 
and discreued in þis wise: 
wrethe is appetite of payne in wreche. 
Of þis principal diuersite bytwene 
wrethe and hate ben itake eiƷte diuersetees 
þe whiche þe philosofer asigneth, 
ii Rethoricorum. 
Þe firste diuersetee 
is for wreth cometh of thinges 
þat toucheth a man hymself 
oþer of thinges 
þat toucheth thinges 
þat perteyneth to hymself, 
and hate may come of thinges 
þat longeth to hymself and to oþere. 
For no man is wroth to anoþer 
but he trowe 
þat he hath itrespassed to hymself 
oþer to his children 
oþer to his frendes 
oþer to som oþer 
þat longeth to hym. 
For it is iseid 
þat wrethe is appetite of peyne not sympleliche, 
but in ordre to wreche; 
and no man is wroth to anoþer 
but for trespas ido to hymsilf 
oþer to oþer 
þat longeth to hym. 
A man hateth anoþer 
for he is euel in hym|silf, 
oþer to oþere 
þat longeth to hymself, 
oþer to oþer. 
For anon as we knowen 
þat a man is euel – 
as whanne we knowen 
þat a man is a þef – we may hate hym 
whether he trespace to vs oþer to oþere. 
Þe seconde diuersite 
is for alwey wrethe is in þe singuler and special, 
and hate may be in comyn; 
for a man may hate alle þefes in comyn 
and alle bak biters 
but he may not be wroth 
but to sum special oon oþer manye. 
For þe comynte of men 
doþ vs no wrong, 
but alwey þe wrong 
folweth sum special man oþer men. 
Þei we may hate endeles manye þeues, 
we ben not wroth 
but to sum synguler and special. 
Þe þridde diuersite, 
for hate hath neuer inow 
but wrethe may haue inow; 
for sif hate is appetite of harme sympleliche, 
he þat we haten may not haue so moche harme 
but we wolle þat he hadde more. 
But wrethe is appetite of peyne, not sympleche, 
but as it is iordeyned 
to wreche and may haue inow; 
for whanne a man 
is so greetliche ipeyned 
þat he þat is wrooth holde hymself awreke 
at þe folle, 
þanne wrethe hath inowƷ and seseth. 
Þe ferthe diuersete is for he 
þat is wroth wol make soro, 
but [he] 
þat hateth wol desire noye and harme; 
and he þat is wrooth wol do smerte and sorwe, 
but he þat hateþ wol do damage and noyƷe. 
Pe fifte diuersete 
is he þat is wroþ wol þat sorwe be knowe, 
and he þat hateþ reccheþ not. 
For it is not inow to hym 
þat is wroþ 
þat þe oþer haþ harm 
but Ʒif a feled 
and but it be oponlich iknowe 
þat þe oþer haþ þe harm by hym, 
for ellis it were no wreche. 
But he þat hateth reccheth not, 
for by cause þat hate is appetite of harm 
sympleliche and withoute condicioun, 
it is inow to hym þat hateth þat þe oþer haue harm how euere he be come | þerto. 
Þe sexte diuersete is for wrethe is alwey 
with woo and sorwe, 
for he þat is wroth is so wo 
but wreche be do 
þat he is alwey 
as it were in sorwe 
forto he haue take wreche. 
But hate may be withoute sorwe, 
for we may hate thinges in comyne; 
for we may hate generaliche alle þeues, 
but it nedeþ not 
þat sorwe folowe suche hate. 
Þeseuenþe diuersite 
isfor it semeth 
þat mercye 
is annexed to wrethe and not to hate. 
For whanne wrethe hath ynow Ʒif 
þe oþer hath moche harme, 
þan he þat is wrooth hath mercye on hym. 
But hate hath no maner mercie 
for it may not haue inowƷ. 
Þe eiƷte diuersite is for wrathe wol 
þat þe oþer haue harme for his trespace. 
For it is inow to hym 
þat is wrooth 
þat þe oþer haue harme 
and be ponysched forto he haue fol wreche. 
But hate destroieþ 
and wol vndo hym þat hateþ, 
for it is not inow to hym 
þat hateþ 
þat þe oþer haue harme 
but he wol þat þe oþer be destroyed and vndo. 
Þanne for þe condicions of hate ben moche worse 
þanne þe condicions of wrethe, 
it nedeth more to be war of hate 
þanne of wrethe 
and to be war 
þat wrathe passe not in to hate; 
for þat is to make a beme of a strowe, 
as Austyn wol mene. 
Þanne al men schulde be war of hate 
and nameliche kynges and princes 
for þei mowe greue and noye manye men. 
And so we knowen þe difference 
bytwene hate and wrethe for hate is worse þan wrethe. 
Nathales Ʒif wrethe is inordinate, 
it is worse. 
Þanne for to knowe how kynges and princes schulde haue hemself 
in wrethe and in þe passioun 
þat hatte mansuetudo, 
it is to wetyng 
þat som tyme wrethe passeth resoun 
and is þanne inor|dinate 
and it is good 
to be war þerof; 
and som tyme it folweth þe ordre of resoun 
and may þanne be ordinate 
and good to folwyng. 
For Ʒif wrethe passeth reson it 
nedeth to be war þerof 
in twey maner wise: 
first, 
for it huyreth not resoun parfitliche; 
þe secounde, 
for it dymmeth and blyndeth resoun. 
For, vii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat wrethe þat passeth resoun is ilikned to houndes 
oþer to swifte oþer to rabbysche seruauntes and hasty; 
for hasty and rabbische seruantes, 
anon as þei heren þe word of here lord, 
ar þey wete rediliche and knowe þe heste of here lord, 
þey rennen rabbischeliche to do his heste. 
Wherfore it happeth hem to do amys 
for þei knowen not parfitliche 
how þei schulde do þat heste. 
Also houndes, 
anoon as þei huren noyse of oon þat cometh, 
þey berken and distyngueth 
not whethere he þat cometh 
is frend oþer foo. 
And so doþ wrethe; 
for anon as resoun meneth 
þat wreche schulde be do, anon wrethe wol renne to take 
wreche not abydynge 
in þat caas þe doom of resoun 
how and in what wise 
þat wreche schulde be itake. 
Þanne it nedeth to be war of inordinate 
wrethe for it 
huyreth not resoun parfitliche. 
Þe seconde, it nedeth to be war of inordinate 
wrethe for it dymmeth and blyndeth resoun. 
For whanne þe body is distempred, 
we ben ilette of vse of resoun; 
wherfore, 
whanne þe wrethed blood cometh 
vp to þe herte, 
þe body is distempred so 
þat we may not þewliche vse resoun. 
For þey resoun and vnderstondyng be not a bodilich vertu, 
nerþelees it vseth 
in his doyng 
bodilich membris and lemys. 
Wherfore Ʒif þe body is distempred, 
resoun | may not frelich vse his owne doynge. 
Wherfore Ʒif eche man schulde be war of blyndyng 
of his resoun 
and [not] be ful obedient to resoun, 
eche man scholde be war of inordinate 
wrethe – and namliche kynges and princes 
for þei scholde most folwe þe heste of resoun. 
But ‡ wrethe may be ordinate 
and worthi to be folwed, 
Ʒif it folweth þe heste of resoun; 
for wraþe is an instrument of resoun 
and doþ þe heste of resoun and vertuous dedes myƷtiliche and strongliche. 
Þerfore, [iii] Ethicorum, 
Homerus is alowed 
þat seide 
þat vertue leuyeth in woodnesse, 
for þan a vertue lyueth in wodnesse 
oþer in wreþe 
in þew manere 
and as it scholde whanne wrethe is instrument of vertue and of resoun. 
Þan it is iknowe 
how we scholde haue vs 
in wrethe and in þe passioun 
þat hatte mansuetudo, 
for þat passioun abateth wrethe 
þat it passeth not þe dome of resoun, 
and wrethe abateth mansuetudo 
þat it letteþ not werkes of vertues and of resoun. 
Ar we deme at þe fulle by resoun whaat is to doynge, 
we scholde be mansueti; 
but after þat we knowen 
what is to doyng, 
we may take wrethe 
as þe seruant of resoun 
þat we may þerby do myƷtiliche þe heste of resoun. 
Þanne þe more semelich 
it is for kynges and princes be not ilet 
in vse of resoun 
and in doynge strongliche þe doom of resoun, 
þe more semeliche it is 
þat þei haue hemself so in wrethe and in mansuetudo. Chapter VIII 
It is iseide tofore 
þat delectacioun and sorwe ben in þe laste degree in þe ordre of passiouns, 
for to hem as to þe laste passions 
and at hem al oþere passions endeth; 
for þer is no passioun 
but it ende at delectacioun oþer at sorwe. 
Þanne for it is iseid | 
and itreted of alle oþere passions, 
it is to spekyng 
and to tretyng 
how kynges and princes scholde haue hemself 
in delectacioun and in sorwe. 
And of delectaciouns was double opynyoun among men 
in oolde tyme, 
as þe philosofer seith, 
x Ethicorum. 
Eudoxius seide þat eche delectacioun is good, 
and what al men desiren semeth most good and most worthi to be chose; 
and alle thinges desiren delectacioun and likynge, 
and it were not so 
but delectacioun were good of itself. 
And hereto Eudoxius 
made anoþer resoun by sorwe 
þat is contrarie to delectacioun, 
and made his resoun in þis wise: 
Ʒif eche sorwe is worthi 
to be forsake 
and hath proprete of iuel and of harme, 
‡ ech delectacioun is worthi 
to be chose 
and hath proprete of good and of profit. 
And oþere menede þe contrarie 
and seide þat al delectacioun is euel. 
But þei þat dampneth 
alle delectaciouns scheweth anon 
þat here 
awne possessioun is fals; for þe philosofer seith þat withoute delectacioun 
may no man leue. 
Þanne as he þat denygeth speche graunteþ speche, 
as þe philosofer, 
iiii Methaphisicorum, 
so he þat seith þat al delectacioun is euel seith 
þat som delectacioun is good. 
For speche may not be denyed but by speche; 
þanne he þat denyeth speche 
speketh and graunteth speche in spekynge; 
wherfore Ʒif he denyeth speche, 
in þe denyynge he graunteþ speche. 
So for no man denyeth al delectacioun and likynge 
but he haue delectacioun 
in þe forsakyng 
of alle delectaciouns and likynge, 
þanne it folweth 
þat he þat forsaketh al likynge cheseth sum delectacioun and likynge. 
And bytwene thes twey weyes 
þat ben al contrarie, 
‡ þe philosoferis wey is | mene; 
for he seith þat notal delectacioun is good 
ofitself noþer 
al delectacioun is euel of itself. 
But sum delectacioun is good in dede, 
and sum delectacioun semeth good, 
and sum is good of itself, 
and sum is good for sum what elles, 
and sum ‡ is good for oon man, 
and som for anoþer. 
For as we seyen and deme in taste 
and in appetite, 
for in som men þe tast is infecte 
as in sek men and in sum men þe [tast] 
is wel disposid 
as in hoole men, 
so in sum men þe appetit is infecte 
as in vicious men 
and is in som men wel desposed 
as in vertuous men and goode men. 
Þanne as not al þyng 
is verrey swete þat semeth swete to seke men 
and to hem 
þat hauen þe tast infecte 
but what semeth swete to hole men 
and to hem 
þat hauen þe tonge wel desposed, 
so not thinges 
þat ben delectable 
and likynge to vicious men 
and to hem 
þat hauen appetite infecte ben verrey delectable and likyng but thinges þat ben delectable 
and likyng to gode men 
and to hem 
þat hauen riƷtful wil. 
Þan som þynges ben verrei delectable and likynge and of hemself 
and som semeþ delectable and likynge; 
and so som delectacioun 
is good in dede and of itself 
and som semeth good 
and for som what elles. 
Also, 
for delectacioun cometh of hauyng of thing 
þat is accordyng, 
þanne for some thinges accordeth to bestes 
and som to men, 
sum delectacions acordeth to bestes 
and som to men. 
And intellectual delectacions and vertuous accorden to men, 
but sencible delectaciouns and delectacions and likynge of lecherie accorden to bestes. 
And Ʒif man schal vse suche delectacions and likynge, 
þat is not onliche 
by cause of suche delectacioun 
but for þei ben iordeyned and seruen to vertuous dedes. 
Panne it is iknowe 
how we | schul haue vs 
in delectaciouns and likynge. 
For by cause þat eche man schulde hate 
to be viciouse 
and to haue bestial maneres, 
eche man scholde not folwe thinges 
þat ben likynge to bestes 
and to vicious men. 
Þanne eche delectacioun is good 
as þe forsaid resons 
preueth but not 
eche delectacioun 
is good 
to alle men and bestes, 
but sum is good to bestes and som to men. 
Þanne þe more kynges and princes scholde hatie to lyuye as bestes, 
þe more þei scholde hate to folwe delectacioun bestial. 
Þanne it is iknowe how kynges and princes scholde haue hemself in delectacioun: 
for principaliche and for itself 
þei schulde haue delectacioun in vertuous dedes 
for alwey delectacioun 
makeþ couenable dedes 
þe more spedful and p[ar]fit. 
Þanne Ʒif kynges and princes hauen likynge in dedes of prudencia, 
þat is wisdom and vertuous workes, 
in þe more spedful manere 
and þe more parfitliche 
þei mowe do suche workes and dedes; 
for þe more delectacioun 
a man haþ in vertuous dedes 
þe more excellentliche 
he doþ þilke dedes. 
And he schulde not principaliche haue delectacioun in sencible dedes 
but he schulde vse hem moderatliche 
in so moche 
as þei ben ordeyned 
to vertuous dedes; 
for Ʒif suche delectaciouns ben stronge, 
þanne he letteth vertuous dedes. 
It is iseie how kynges and princes schulde bere hemself 
in delectacioun and likynge; 
now it is to wetynge 
how þei scholde haue hemself in sorwe. 
And sorwe is neuere to takyng 
bot it be for foule doyng; 
for Ʒif a man knoweth þat he hath do foule dedes and vile, 
þerfore he schulde be wo and sory. 
For by cause of foule dedes and doynge man scholde be sory, 
but alle oþer sorwe schulde | be moderate and forsake. 
Þanne for to moderat suche sorwe, 
remedies schal be Ʒeue 
by þe whiche suche sorwe may be voided. 
And it semeth 
þat þe philosofer toucheth þree remediis 
by þe whiche sorwe may be voided. 
Þe þre remedies ben vertues, frendes, 
and consideracioun of þe soþe 
and of þe treuthe. 
By vertues, sorwe is voided, 
for as þe philosofer meneth, 
ix Ethicorum, euel men and vicious hauen no ioye of hemself 
for þei fynden in hemself 
no thing where of þey mow haue likyng; 
for euel men ben enemyes to hemself 
and striuen with hemself 
as it is iseide. 
Þerefor þei demen oon by resoun and doþ 
þe contrarie by passioun, 
wherfore þei hauen no pes in hemself 
and hauen 
þerfore no ioye of hemself. 
Þanne for to haue likyng in vssilf, 
it is a greet remedie 
to voide vices 
and haue vertues. 
Þe seconde remedie is confort of frendes, 
as it is iseid. 
Þerefor it semeth 
þat sorwe is a certeyn wiƷt oþer heuynesse 
þat greueth þe saule. 
Þanne as in bodiliche heuynesse 
oþer in wiƷt we ben þe lasse igreued 
with þat wi[Ʒt] 
oþere berþene 
[whanne manye helpen vs beren it], 
so whanne we seen many frendes sory 
for vs we ben iliƷted of þat sorwe 
and ben þe lasse sory. 
Þei þis resoun be itouched, 
ix Ethicorum, 
Ʒit it is iseid 
þat it was Platoes resoun 
and þis resoun semeth not al trewe. 
For we schulde be sory 
forsorwe ofoure frendes. 
Þanne whanne we seeth oure frendes sory, 
it semeth þat oure sorwe scholde be þe more and not þe lasse. 
And we may also seye 
þat whanne we seeth oure frendes sory 
for oure sorwe, 
oure sorwe is not þe lasse 
for þei ben sory. 
But for we seeth hem sory, 
we hauen | stedfast fantasie and trist 
þat þei ben oure frendes; 
and for it is likynge to haue frendes, 
we hauen likynge and by þat likynge oure sorwe 
is þe lasse for al likynge dooþ 
awey al sorwe or maketh it þe lasse. 
Þe þridde remedye is consideracioun, 
þat is bythenkyng, 
of soþnesse and of trowþe. 
For þey we schulde be sory 
for foule workes and dedes, 
Ʒut for worldlich catel and richesse 
þat we may haue and lese so 
þat we do no foule dedes 
we schulde not be sory. 
And herto þe beste remedye 
is þe consideracioun of sothnesse and of trouthe. 
For by such consideracioun we knowen 
þat suche good and catel 
is but litel worthi, 
þerfore [þei] 
we lesen suche good and catel, 
we schulde not be sory 
but it happe for som what ellis 
in so moche 
as by lost þerof we ben ilette of vertuos workes and dedes. 
Þanne it is iknowe 
þat we scholde not be sory bote for foule doyng and vicious. 
And Ʒif we hauen sorwe for oþer thinges, 
it scholde be voided by vertues oþer by frendes oþere 
by knowynge of þe sothe 
and of þe trouþe. 
And ofte herto [is] iordeyned 
þe ferþe helpe þat stondeth 
in bodilich remedies 
as sleep, bathyng, 
and oþere suche 
þat ofte doþ awey sorwe. 
Þanne, 
forsuche sorweletteth vertuous werkes and dedes, 
þe more semelich it is 
þat kynges and princes schulde be excellent and passe oþer men 
in vertuous workes and dedes, 
þe more semelich it is 
þat kynges and princes abate and putte of suche sorwe. Chapter IX 
As twelf vertues ben irekened tofore of þe whiche foure ben principal and eiƷte ben 
as it were anexed, 
so among þes twelf passions 
þat ben irekened 
(folwynge þe lore of oure predeces|sours) 
we may say þat foure ben principale 
as hope, drede, ioie and sorwe. 
And by þ[r]e weyes we may preue 
þat þes ben more principale 
þan oþere: first, 
by comparisoun to oþere passions; 
þe seconde, 
by comparisoun to þeobiectis 
(þat is castyng to) 
and to þe mater of þe 
whiche he stondeþ; 
þe þridde, 
by comparisoun to þe myƷtful vertues of þe sow[l]e in þe whiche þei ben inne for þei ben in þe irascible, wrethful, 
and þe concupiscible, coueitise. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise, 
for alle oþere passions semen iordeyned to þese passions; 
for þe passions 
þat ben itake 
in comparisoun to good semen iordeyned to ioie and to hope, 
and þe passions 
þat ben itake in comparisoun to euel 
and to harme semeth iordeyned to drede and to sorwe. 
For þe passioun 
þat is itake 
in comparisoun to good bygynneth first 
at loue and passeth þanne in to desire and endeth in hope while good is to comynge, 
and endeth atte laste in ioye 
and in delectacioun 
whan þat good is igete and is present. 
And in comparisoun to [euel] 
and to harm þe passioun bygynneþ 
at hate and passeth in to abhominacioun 
while þat euel and harme is to comynge, 
[and endeth atte laste in sorwe] 
Ʒif þat euel is come and is present. 
Þanne drede and sorwe 
ben also passions principale, 
for to hem ben iordeyned two passions 
þat ben itake 
in comparisoun to euel 
and to harme as þe passions 
þat ben itake in comparisoun to good ben iordeyned to hope and to ioye. 
Þe seconde wey for to preue 
þat þes passions ben pryncipal may be take 
by þe matiere 
in þe whiche he stondeth, 
for eche passioun is itake 
in comparisounto goodoþer toeuel. 
Alsogood oþer euel isto comyng | 
oþer it is present, 
and þerby þis foure passions ben itake: 
for of good þat is to comyng is hope, 
and of good þat is present is ioye; 
and of euel and harme þat is to comyng is drede, 
and of euel and harme þat is present is sorwe. 
In þe þridde manere þes passions may be take in comparisoun 
to þe potencial vertues of þe soule 
as in comparisoun 
to þe irascible 
and to þe concupiscible 
in þe whiche þei ben inne. 
And it is iseid 
þat þe concupiscible (þe coueitouse) 
taketh heed to good 
and to euel 
for it is good oþer euel, 
and þe irascible 
(þat is wrethful) 
taketh hede þerto 
for it is wiþ difficulte. 
Þanne, 
for som good is most good 
whanne it is igete 
and þerinne stondeth delectacioun, delit and ioye, 
and euel and harme is worst 
whan it is come 
and þerinne stondeþ 
wo and sorwe, delit and sorwe mot be principal passions of þe coueitous. 
And for þe wrethful taketh hede 
and knoweth good and euel 
þat is with difficulte, 
and for in good is acounted most difficulte 
whan it is to comyng 
and þerof is hope, 
and [for] of euel 
þat is to comynge is drede, 
hope and drede 
ben principal passions of þe irascible. 
And for of passions cometh dyuersite 
of oure workes and dedes, 
it is semelich 
þat we take bisiliche hede 
wherof we schulde haue ioye, delectacioun, 
oþer sorwe and wherof we schulde haue hope and drede. 
And þat is þe more semlich [for] kynges and princes, 
in so moche as here dedes and workes 
ben more worthi and longeth 
to þe comyn profit. 
And kynges and princes scholde haue hemself þeuliche 
in delectacioun and sorwe, 
in hope and in drede, 
as it is declared by þe forseid chapitres. Chapter X 
Tofore ben twelf passions | yrekened 
þat ben loue, hate, desire, 
abhominacioun, sorwe, delit, hope, despeire, drede, hardinesse, 
wrethe and methnesse. 
But al withoute þese passions, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
it semeth þat þe philosofer rekeneth sex oþere passions 
þat ben icleped Ʒelus, 
gratia (loue or envie, and grace), nemesis (þat is to menyng indignacioun of prosperite of euel men), misericordia (mercie), envie, and schamefastnesse and scome. 
And alle þe passions ben reducte and ibrouƷt to som of þe forseide twelf passions, 
for gelus and gratia ben ibrouƷt and reducte to loue; 
verecundia (schamefastnesse) to drede; 
inuidia (enuye), 
and misericordia (mercie), 
and nemesis 
(þat is indignacioun of prosperite of euel men) 
ben reducte to sorwe. 
For Ʒelus (gelesi) 
is reducte to loue 
for Ʒelus (gelusi) 
is nouƷt elles but a strong loue. 
Andþynges þat we louen stronglich, 
sum ben corporal and bodiliche 
and sum ben incorporal, not bodilich 
but spiritual and gostlich; 
and Ʒif þei ben corporal, 
for som men hauen suche thinges 
and han oþer not, 
þerfore in comparisoun to suche thinges 
Ʒelus is ofte diffined oþer descreuid in þis wise: 
Ʒelus is strong loue and suffreth no felowschipe 
ne partener in þe þyng 
þat is iloued. 
But in comparisoun to spiritual thinges 
strong loue is good and ipreysed 
and is as it were comyne; 
for neuere man is vertuous noþer loueth properliche vertues 
Ʒif he wol not haue felowschipe in vertues. 
And suche Ʒelus in comparisoun 
to worschepful good 
is discreued bi þe philosofer, ii Rethoricomm, 
þat it is sorwe of suche good 
not for anoþer 
haþ suche good 
but for he haþ no such good. 
Panne Ʒelus is reducte to loue. 
And also gratia is reducte to loue, 
for by loue a man is gracious to anoþer. 
For as þe philosofer 
treteth of gratia, 
| and as it is of passion, 
gratia is nouƷt elles 
but a sterynge of þe soule 
by þe whiche man is inclined and imeued to Ʒeue Ʒiftes 
and to do good to oþere. 
Þan Ʒelus and gratia ben ibrouƷt to loue. 
But verecundia, schamefastnesse, 
is reducte to drede; 
and a man may drede in twey manere wise: 
corrupcioun and vnworschip. 
And he þat dredeth corupcioun and bodyliche harm 
is timidus, ferfol, 
but he þat dredeth schame and velony 
is icleped verecundus. 
Þanne verecundia is nouƷt elles 
but drede of schame 
oþer of velonie. 
Þerfore ofte verecundia 
is cleped erubescencia, 
wexinge reed, 
for comoniich he 
þat is aschamed wexeþ reed 
as he þat dredeþ wexeth paal. 
For Ʒif a man trowe 
þat he schal lose his lif, 
þat is inward good, 
þanne he dredeth; 
but Ʒif he troweth 
to leese his worschip, 
þanne he is aschamed. For in drede 
þe blood draweth inward 
and þe membres ben pale withoute 
for drede cometh of trowyng 
þat a man schal luse inward good. 
But whan a man is aschamed, 
þe blood draweth outward 
and þe face semeth reed; 
and þe blood renneth þanne outward, 
for schame cometh of trowyng 
of lost of outward good. 
Þanne is twey manere drede: 
on is drede of lost of inward good, 
and in þat drede a man wexeth pale; 
and þe oþer is drede of lost of honour 
and worschep þat is outward good, 
and in þat drede a man wexeth reed. 
Þanne drede of corrupcioun 
and of lost of inward good, 
for it hath no speciale name, 
holdeth þe comyne name 
and is icleped tymor. 
But drede of lost of honour and worschipe hath a special name 
and is icleped vere|cundia and erubescencia also. 
Þanne verecundia, schamefastinesse, 
is a manere drede 
and is reducte and ibrouƷt to drede. 
For it is iknowe how Ʒelus, gelousie, and gratia 
ben reducted and ibrouƷt to loue 
and how verecundia 
is reducte to drede, 
it is to wetynge how inuidia (envie), 
and misericordia (mercy), 
and nemesis 
(þat is indignacioun) 
ben reducte to sorwe. Þanne it is to wetyng 
þat þes þre ben special maners of sorwe 
for a man may be sory 
for anoþeris harme oþer good. 
For Ʒif he is sory 
for anoþeris harme 
and troweth namlich 
þat he hath wrongfullich 
þat harme, 
þat is misericordia, 
rewþe; for, ii Rethoricorum, 
it is iseid 
þat misericordia 
is not elles 
but a certein sorwe of harme 
þat is iseie and iknowe and corrumpeth a man 
and maketh hym sory 
þat hath þat harme with wrong. 
And Ʒif a man is sory 
not for harme of anoþer man 
but for his good, 
þat may be in twey manere wise 
oþer for his good in itself, 
and so it is inuidia. 
For as it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
inuidia is not elles 
but a certein sorwe for þe‡ apparent occasiun of oþere mennes good; 
þat is to say þei 
ar able to falle 
bytwene men of oo staat. 
And þat hath suche sorwe 
is not sory 
for he hath not þulke good, 
but he is sory 
þat anoþer man hath þilke good. 
For inuidia, enuye, 
is not elles but sorwe 
for anoþer mannes good, 
not for he himself 
hath not þat good 
but for an nother to wham he hath enuye 
þat hath þat good. 
And enuye is most bytwene peeres and men of oon estat as crockers hauen envie to crockers and smethes to smethes 
and so of oþere manere men. 
But 3¿f a man is sory for anoþer mannis good – 
and not in al maner wise 
but | 
for he is not worthi to haue 
þat good – 
and so he is nemesis, 
þat is indignacioun. 
For, ii Rethoricorum, 
þe philosofer seith þat nemesis, indignation, 
is sorwe for his good and prosperite 
þat is not worthi to haue good and prosperite. Þanne Ʒif alle þese passions 
maken diuersite 
in oure workes and dedes, 
it is semelich 
þat we knowe hem alle. 
And þe more excellent workes kynges and princes schude haue, 
þe more semelich it is 
þat he knowe alle þes passions. Chapter XI Summe of þe forseide passions 
semen good as misericordia (rewþe) 
[and] verecundia (schamefastnesse); 
for, 
as þe philosofer seith, 
þeiö verecundia 
be not a vertue, 
Ʒut it is a good passioun. 
So gratia and nemesis semen good passions. 
And somme of þes passions 
ben to blamyng 
as envye and hate, 
for hate is to blame 
but it be for som vicious doynge; 
and oþere passions 
may be both good and euel. 
Þerfore it is bisiliche to wetynge 
þat alwey in man[er]es and in þewes 
þe mene is ipreysed 
and to moche and to luyte is iblamed. 
Þanne þe passions 
þat semen good of hemself 
ben mene as he 
þat is verecundus 
is mene bytwene hym þat is stupidus 
(þat is aschamed of al thing) 
and hym þat is inuerecundus. 
For he þat is aschamed of al þyng 
is icleped stupidus 
and he þat is aschamed of no thing is icleped inverecundus, 
and neiþer of þese is to preising. 
And he þat is mene 
and is aschamed 
as he scholde and not aschamed 
but as he scholde is cleped verecundus 
and is to preysyng. 
Also misericordia (mercie, rewthe) 
is mene bytwene cruelnesse and mollicies, neschenesse, 
for he þat hath reuthe of no thing | is cruel 
and he þat hath rewthe 
of al þyng is mollis (nesche) and wommanliche. 
And he þat hath rewþe of hem 
þat hauen harme wrongfulliche 
is mene 
and is to preisyng 
and is icleped mysericors, merciable. 
And also nemesis is mene bytwene inuidia (envye) and placiditas, 
for he þat is envious is sory for al prosperite 
and he þat is placidus, plesant, 
and contrarie to hym 
þat is envious man 
hath ioye of al prosperite. 
And he þat is nemesius 
(þat is indignacioun of prosperite) is mene, 
for he hath ioye of prosperite ‡ of good men 
and is sory for prosperite of euel men. 
And also gratia þat is ipreised is mene 
bytwene to moche and to lite for he þat is gracious to al men worthi and vnworthi is to blame, 
and he þat is gracious 
to no man is to blame. 
But he þat is gracious to hem 
þat ben worthi and not to hem 
þat ben not worthi is mene and is ipreysed. 
Þanne goode passions 
beþ mene and euele passions passeth or lakketh in to moche oþer to lite. 
For al þat is to moche 
oþer to lite is to blame, 
for enuye passeth in to moche 
for þerof cometh sorwe of al prosperite; 
and also [ha]te is to blame, 
for it passeth in to moche. 
And passions þat may be bothe good 
and euel ben to blame 
Ʒif þei holden to moche 
oþer to lite and ben goode Ʒif þey holden þe mene. 
Now þis is iknowe, 
it is to wetynge 
how kynges and princes schulde haue hemself 
in þese passions. 
For þei scholde haue gratia, grace, and misericordia 
for þei ben good passions, 
for it is semelich 
þat þei be gracious and merciable. 
For nameliche þei schulde dele 
and Ʒeue good and harme – good 
to good men 
and peyne to euel men. 
And benefice and reward ben þanne riƷtfulliche ideled whanne | kynges and princes 
and þei þat scholde dele suche rewardes 
to goode men ‡ and worthi ben gracious. 
And harme and peyne ben þewliche ideled whanne alwey 
þei [‡] 
ben imeued to mercie 
[forhem þatsoffren vnworthiliche]. 
And verecundia and nemesis, 
þei he seme good passiouns, 
longiþ not to kingis and princis in al wise, 
for it is not semelich to hem to be schamefast; 
for it is not semelich 
to hem to do werkis and dedis 
wherfor þei schulde be aschamid. 
It is yseide, iiii Ethicorum, 
þat we preisin childrin 
þat be schamfast; 
and no man preisiþ 
þe olde men Ʒif he is schamfast, 
[for] we gessin not 
þat hem nediþ to do werkis and dedis 
where he schulde be aschamid. 
Also þer it is iseid 
þat studius men schuld not be aschamid, 
for schame cumþ of euil dedis 
and a stodius man schulde noƷt do euil dedis. 
Wherfore Ʒif it is semelich 
þat kynges and princes scholde be olde in maneres, 
it is not semelich 
þat he be aschamed 
but Ʒif it be by supposicion and happe. 
For Ʒif it happeth hem to do foule dedes, 
he schulde be aschamed. 
And nemesis semeth not moche to preysyng noþer is moche ipreised, 
for þerby som man hath indignacioun 
to greet of prosperite of euel men. 
For euel men mow not haue þe moste good, 
þat is vertuous; 
but oon caas þei mowe haue mene good 
oþer good 
þat is lest worthi, 
as outward good and good 
þat is lest worthi, 
it is not gretlich to chargyng to euel men 
to haue suche good so 
þat þei haue not suche good 
by mysdoyng and wrong. 
For Ʒif a man scholde dele þis good 
and make Ʒiftes þerof, 
he scholde not dele þat good to vnworthi men 
but to worthi men. 
Þanne kynges and princes scholde so be nemeseci, 
hauyng indignacioun, 
and thei scholde be mansueti 
and haue indignacioun 
of prosperite of euel men so þat þei dele not here good to hem þat ben vnworthi. 
Þanne þei schulde haue hemself 
in þis wise in passions 
þat | semen good. 
And þey schulde voide and forsake enuye 
þat is an euel passioun; 
and also he schulde forsake hate 
but it were 
for som vicious doyng, 
for vices ben to hatynge and worthi 
to be distroied 
with myƷt and strengthe. 
In oþere passions 
þat may be good 
and euel þei schulle haue hemself 
wel Ʒif þei haue þe vertues of þe whiche we made mencioun tofore. 
For by þe vertue mansuetudo þei mowe haue hemself wel in wrethe 
and in þe contrarie þerof, 
for he is mansuetus 
þat is wrooth 
as he scholde 
and whanne he scholde 
and how he scholde. 
And by þe vertue fortitudo þei mow haue hemself wel in hardinesse and in drede; 
for he is fortis 
þat is hardi 
as he scholde 
and dredeth as he scholde. 
By magnanimite and humilite þei schulde 
haue hemself wel in hope and in despeire. 
For magnanimite abateth despeire 
þat it schal nouƷt withdrawe 
fro excellent and passyng good 
by cause of difficulte, hardnesse. 
And humilite, mekenesse, moderateth hope 
þat me scholde not take to grete peril to come to þat good 
by cause of goodnesse and likyng þat is þerinne. 
And by oþer vertues 
þat ben in þe concupiscible 
þey mowe haue hemself 
wel in passions of þe concupiscible, coueitous, 
so þat þei mowe loue 
as þei scholde, and desire, 
and haue abhominacioun and delectacioun 
and be sori ‡ 
als he scholde, 
and haue hemself 
in alle þese 
as ordre and reule and resoun axeth. 
Þanne at þis tyme be þis inow of passions; 
for Ʒif ouƷt failleth here, 
it schal be declared innermore [more] diffuselich. 
For in þe þridde book we schal trete of drede, 
of loue, and of misericordia, 
and of oþere 
as þe mater axeth. 
For þere we schal declare how kynges and princes 
schal bere hemself 
to be drad of þe | puple 
and how to haue loue of þe puple 
and how he schal be merciable 
and how he schal be gelous. 
For moche þat heere is treted generallich 
schal be þare declared particularliche. 
Touchinge þe passions 
of þe concupiscible, 
þat þei mowe loue and desire 
and haue abhominacioun 
and be sory 
as þei scholde and do 
in alle þese 
as ordre and reule of resoun axeth of passions, 
be þis inow at þis tyme. Book I Part IV DOI: 10.4324/9781315861739-63 
Whiche maners of children ben good 
and how kynges and princes schulde haue hem þerinne. 
Whiche maners of children ben euel 
and how kynges and princes schulde haue hem to suche maners. 
Whiche maners of olde men ben iuel 
and how kynges and princes schulde forsake suche maners. 
Whiche maners of olde men ben good 
and whiche ben þe maners of men of mene age 
and how kynges and princes schulde haue hem in suche maners. 
Whiche ben þe maners of noble men 
and how kynges and princes scholde haue hemself to suche maners. 
Whiche ben þe maners of riche men 
and how kynges and princes scholde haue hemself to suche maners. 
Whiche ben þe maneres of myƷti men 
and how kynges and princes schulde haue hemself to suche maners. Chapter I 
For þre parties ben isped of þis firste book 
in þe whiche it is declared 
wherinne kynges and princes schulde sette here ende 
and with what vertues þey schulde be higt 
and what passions 
þei scholde folwe and forsake, 
it is to declarynge in þe ferþe partie 
what maneres and þewes 
þei scholde folwe and haue. 
And maners mowe be diuerse 
in tweye maner wise, 
by age and by fortune. | Bi age, 
for childrin and olde men 
and men of mene age 
hauin diuers maneris. 
And ‡ fortune makiþ diuers[i]te in maneris, 
for þe good of fortune 
þat is outward good 
(as nobilnesse and gentillesse and myƷt and richesse) 
makeþ gret diuersitee ‡ in maners 
and in þewes. 
For comonliche noble men 
hauen oþere maners þan þei þat ben nat noble and gentil, 
and myƷte men hauen oþere maners 
þan vnmyöti, 
and riche men oþere maners 
þan pore men. 
Of al þese maneres we schul speke. 
But firste we schul speke 
of maners of children; 
of here maners summe ben good 
and sum ben euel. 
Also, ii Rethoricorum, 
þe philosofer toucheth oþer thinges of children 
and speketh of sex maners 
þat ben good and of sexe 
þat ben euel. 
And first, 
here manere is good 
for þei ben liberal and fre herted. 
Þe seconde, 
for þei ben bolde 
and of good hope. 
Þe þridde, for þei ben magnanimi. 
Þe ferþe, 
for þei ben not malicious. 
Þe fifte, 
for þei wol sone haue mercye and forƷeue trespas. 
Þe sexte and þe laste, 
for þei ben schamefast. 
And children ben liberal 
for þei ben not expert 
noþer hauen assayed nede and defaute noþer hauen igete þe good 
þat þei hauen 
with here owne trauaille. 
For ech man kepeth his owne good 
þe more besiliche 
whan he haþ heed harme for ‡nede 
and for defaute 
oþer Ʒif he hath gete good and catel wiþ his sleiƷte and trauaille. 
For what is igete with trauaille is þe more besiliche ikept and iholde, 
in so moche þat eche man hath likyng 
in his workes and dedes, 
so þat he loueth þe bettre al 
þat he geteth 
with his owne sleiƷthe and traueille. 
Þe secounde, children ben of good hope 
and þat is for þre skiles 
as þe philosofer preueth, 
[ii] Rethoricorum. 
For children ben bolde 
and of grete | hope first, 
for þei hauen assaied 
but lite noþer hauen ofte ifailled of here purpos, 
þerfore þei wenen to do alle thinges. 
And ben also of good hope 
for þei hauen moche blood 
in þe herte and in oþere membris 
þat taken grete heete of þe blood 
þat is in children. 
And so þerfore þei ben of good hope 
and boold and hardy to do al thinges. 
Also children hauen liued 
but a litel while and schal lyue longe 
afterward 
by comune cours of kynde. 
Þanne for mynde is of thing 
þat is ago and hope of thing 
þat is to comyng, 
children hauen litel mynde and grete hope. 
For children hauen not greet likyng in dedes 
þat þei hauen ido, 
for þei hauen no mynde 
but of fewe dedes 
þat þei hauen ido and lyte; 
but þei hauen greet likynge 
in thenkynge of thinges 
þat ben to comynge, 
for þei hopen to do grete dedes. 
Wherfore þei ben bolde 
and of grete hope. 
Þe þridde, children ben magnanimi 
and þe cause 
þerof is asigned by thinges 
þat ben iseid. 
For þerby a man is magnanimus 
for he makeþ him worthi 
to greet doynge 
and putteth hymself 
forþ to grete dedes. 
Þan [for] children ben liberal, 
and for þei ben bolde and of good hope, 
þei hauen not what hem schulde withdrawe noþer lette whi þei scholde nat be magnanimi. 
And herto may a special resoun be assigned. 
For children ben passyng hote 
and it longeþ to þyng 
þat is hot to be aboue. 
Alwey children wolde be aboue, 
so we seen in þe ordre of þe elementes 
þat alway þe hote elementes 
as fuyre and ayer 
ben alwey aboue 
þe colde elementis 
þat ben erþe and water. 
Þanne for among oþer thinges 
by þe whiche a man semeth hiƷe and excellent, 
children desiren most honour and worschep 
and ben by þe consequent folwynge in sum wise magnanimi. 
And þe proper mater | of magnanimus semeþ worschep. 
Þe ferþe, 
children ben to preysyng, 
for þei ben not malicious 
for þei trowen 
þat al men ben gode. 
And þe cause is for þei trowen 
and knowen not þe dedes of men by thinges 
þat þei hauen isey; 
but by þing þat þei knowen in hemself, 
so þei trowen 
þat it is in oþer men. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þat by here owne 
innoc[e]nse þei demen of oþere; 
and so for þei ben innocentes, 
þei wenen þat oþere ben innocentes. 
Þe fifte, 
children wol sone haue mercye and forgeue; 
for, 
as it is iseid tofore, 
Ʒif we trowen 
þat men hauen harme with wrong, mercie comeþ principallich þerof. 
Wherfore Ʒif children 
by here innocence 
demeþ of oþere and troweþ 
þat þei hauen harme with wrong, 
þei ben sone imeued to mercy. 
Þe sexte, children ben schamfast for þei desiren to moche worschep. 
For, 
as it is ised tofore, 
schamefastnesse is drede of lost of worschep. 
Þan for children ben passyng hoot and desiren gretlich to be excellent and dreden lost of worschep, 
wherfore in þat wise 
þei wexen sone aschamed. 
But þe philosofer, 
[ii Rethorjicorum, 
toucheþ anoþer cause 
whi children ben kindelich schamefast. 
For, 
as he seith, 
he knoweþ not 
but what þei ben tauƷt by lawe; 
and þei clepen laweful lore 
hestes of fader and moder 
by þe whiche children ben itauƷt. 
Þan for modres techen here children 
to do honest dedes 
and for honeste 
is þe staat of worschep, 
children desiren many thinges 
þat worschip stondeþ inne. 
And by þe contrarie 
þei dreden moche thinges 
by þe whiche þei scholde be aschamed 
and lese worschep. 
And for schamefulnesse 
is drede of lost of worschip, 
children ben | sone aschamed. 
It is iknowe what maners ben good in children, 
and it may be sone iknowe how kynges and princes schulde haue hemself to suche maneres. 
For not al þyng 
þat is to preysyng 
is symplelich to preysyng in al þyng, 
for we seen þat schrewednesse and angre 
is to preysyng in an hound 
but not in a man. 
So þei schamefastnesse 
be to preysyng in children, 
for by cause of age 
þei mowe not kepe hemself 
but Ʒif þei doun foule dedes 
of þe whiche he scholde be aschamed. 
But kynges and princes, 
þat schulde [ben] 
as it were half goddis, 
schold not onlich haue abhominacion 
to foule dedes 
but also to hure speke of foule dedes; 
for schrewed talkyng corompeth and destroyeþ good maneres and þewes. 
Þan þei ben not in þe staat 
in þe whiche þei scholde be aschamed. 
Þan it is not semelich 
to hem 
to ben aschamed, 
but by supposicioun. 
Ʒif it happeþ to hem to do foule dedes, 
he schulde be aschamed 
more þan oþere men; 
for he doþ more vnsemelich 
þan oþer men 
for he doþ more þan oþer men. 
Þan þe first fife 
þat we seide ben to preysyng in children 
we may applie to kynges and princes, 
for þei scholde be liberal, 
of good hope, 
not malicious, magnanimi, and merciable. 
And þe sixte, 
to be schamfast, 
is not sympliche semeliche 
to kynges and princes. 
For kynges and princes scholde be liberal, 
for þei dede aƷenst kynde Ʒif þei multeplied 
þe grete richesse 
þat þei hauen 
and spende it not 
in þe[w] wise 
as he schulde 
as we touchede 
at þe foll tofore 
in tractatu de liberalitate. 
And þe more worþy þe commune nedes 
ben passyng oþer nedes, 
þe more semelich it is 
þat kynges and princes scholde be of good hope 
þan oþer men. 
Also þei scholde be magnanimi, 
for it is iseid in a chapitre, 
de magnanimitate, 
þat [mlagnanimitas longeþ most to kynges 
and to princes for it is most semelich 
þat þei doun passing grete dedes. 
Also þei schulde not be malicious 
so þat þei schulde haue not [of] 
al men euel suspecioun 
neiþer alwey 
mystake þe dedes of here sogettes, 
for so þei myƷt be tyrantes 
and destroye þe peple. 
Also þei schulde be merciable 
for as þe philosofer seith, 
2 Rethoricorum, 
comonlich men doun euel and | þerfore brotelnes [of mankynde axeth forgifte] 
of synnes and of trespas. 
Wherfore kynges and princes 
þat Ʒeuen þe lawe schulde be merciable 
and not schamfast symplich, 
as it is iseid tofore. Chapter II 
As we rekened tofore sex good maneres of children, 
so we may rekene of hem sex euel maneres 
þe whiche þe philosofer touchen, 
ii [Rethor]icorum: first, 
for children folwen passions; 
þe seconde, 
for þei ben vnstedefast and vnstable; 
þe iii, 
for þei trowen tales to sone; 
þe 4, 
for þei chiden and striven; 
þe fifþe, 
for þei ben liers and fonden 
in som wise to 
mey[n]tene al þat he telleþ; 
þe sixte, 
in here doynge þei hauen no mesure 
but þei don al þat þei doun passyng mesure. 
And first, children folwen passions, 
and namlich likyng of body, 
and ben incontinent 
and folwen lechery 
and þat is for ii causes. 
For by cause þat children ben passyng hote and appetite of lecherie 
comeþ 
of hete of þe body, 
þerfore kynde disposicion of þe body 
exciteþ children 
to lykyng of lecherye. 
For as it were 
in al oure dedes 
we folwen passiouns oþer resoun, 
and þe lasse maistrie reson haþ in vs, 
þe more maistrye passions hauen in vs, 
þan for children ben not expert noþer hauen gret vnderstondyng and prudencia 
and ben more ilad by passions 
þan by reson, wherfore comynlich he folweþ passions. 
Þe ii, þei ben vnstable and vnstedefast, 
for þe soule folweþ complexions of þe body. 
Þan as in bodies of children humores ben in gret meuyng, 
so þei hauen suyþe vnstabil likynge and wil. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þat children hauen strong appetite 
and hauen sone inouƷ 
and desiren strongliche and changen anon. 
Þe 3, 
þei trowen tales to sone; 
and as it longeþ to þis doyng, 
þat may be for twey causes. First, 
for þei ben not malicious noþer trowen 
þat oþere men ben euel 
but by here innocentry þei demen oþere men, 
þan for it is kyndelich 
þat a man trowe sone hym þat he holdeþ good 
and troweth not 
þat þei speken of malice, children, 
in trowyng 
þat al men ben innocent, 
trowen al men sone. 
Also þis may be for children ben not expert; 
for þei þat ben not tauƷt 
by manie wordes 
and hiren many wordes of hem 
þat ben itauƷt, 
þei taken hede of fewe þinges and demen sone. 
Þerfore it is iseid 
in a prouerbe þat he þat knoweþ lite demeþ sone. 
Þan children, 
for þei ben non expert 
of many thinges, 
anon as eny nede is pursewed to hem, 
þei mowe non take hede of many thinges 
and demeþ 
þerfore anon of þat nede and troweþ 
as it is ‡ itold to hem. 
And Ʒif þei knowe 
in any thinges and nedes, 
and Ʒif þei kun take consideracione of condiciouns of men, 
þei wolde not anon assent and trowe al þyng 
þat is told to hem 
bot þei wolde bysilich avise hem 
wheþer it were to trowe oþer no. 
Þe ferþe, children chiden and striuen. 
For as it is iseid tofore, 
children desire most | [to be] excellent. 
Þerfore Ʒif þei seen oþere more excellent 
þan þei ben, 
þei chiden and striuen anoon. 
Þe fifte, 
children ben liers and fonden 
in som wise to meynteyne 
al þat he telleth, 
for þei ben not expert 
noþer knowen hemself. 
And nathales he weneth 
þat he knowe al þyng 
and answereth 
þerfore 
to alle thinges; 
and he wolde be holde kunnyng 
and wol þat men wene 
þat þey kun sckele in al thing, 
and þei affermen al thing 
for to be holde konnynge. 
And for þei affermen thinges 
þat þei knowen <noƷt>, 
þei lien ofte tymes. 
And whanne þei lien falsliche, 
Ʒit þei desiren worschip and fonden to meynteyne 
þey[re] lesyng and wenen 
þat þei ben in worschip by þe lesyng þeiƷ it seme it be not as þei tellen. 
Þe vi, 
þei han no 
m[esur]e in here dedes but þei doun 
al here 
dedes passyng mesure and manere. 
ii Rethoricorum, 
it is iseid 
þat þei louen passyng mesure 
and haten passyng mesure, 
and so þei doun 
in loue and hate and doun here 
dedes passyng mesure and maner. 
And þat is for þei [ben] 
of scharp wreþe and haþ strong delectacioun and likyng, 
for wraþ and delectacioun ben strong 
but he be abated by resoun. 
Þan for children leuen more 
and ben ilad by passioun 
þan by resoun, 
here delectacioun is not moderat 
but þei doun 
al here dedes passyng mesure and ouerdon. 
For it is knowe 
which ben þe euel maneres of children, 
it may be son iknowe how kynges and princes scholde haue hemself 
in swiche maneres. 
For Ʒif swiche maneres 
ben to blame in children, 
moche more þei ben to blame 
in olde men 
and ben most to blamyng 
in kynges and princes 
þat schulde be heed 
and rewle of oþer. 
And it is vnsemelich 
þat þei folwe passions and þat þei haue strong appetite and delectacioun in lecherye, 
for in hem schulde be most wit and vnderstondyng 
and þei þat doun so leuen not by resoun 
but by passioun. 
Also it is fule and detestabile 
for hem to be vnstedefast and vnstable. 
For [Ʒif] it is inconuenient Ʒif þe rewele ys croked, 
| and kynges and princis scholde be ensample of leuyng and rewle of oþere men, 
þan it is inconuenient Ʒif þei ben sone peruerte and vnstable, 
for þei schuld be stedefast and stable. 
Þe þridde, 
þei ne scholde trowe euel tales to sone for þei hauen many flaterers 
and many bak biters 
þat speken in here geres. 
Þerfore þei scholde wiþ greet besynesse 
þenk and deuyse hem what maner men 
þai ben þat speken – wheþer 
þei ben wyse men or vnwise, vertuous or vicious; 
for wise men and good schulde be more itrowed 
þan vnwise and euel. 
Þe ferþe, 
þei scholde not do wrong noþer despite; 
for þei scholde do ponysching 
and not wrong noþer despit noþer wikkednesse 
but for riƷt and for þe comyn profit. 
Þe v, 
and namelich kynges and princes 
and generallich al lordes schulde voide and forsake lesynges 
lest þei make hemself worthi to be spysed. 
For Ʒif lesynges makeþ men worthi to be spised, 
wiþ þe more cautel and besynesse 
þey schulde studie to knowe þe soþe 
and holde þerwiþ. 
Þe sexte, 
þei [scholde] hauen ‡ mesour 
in here dedes; 
for by cause þat oþer thinges 
ben moderate by mesure, 
it is most nede 
þat rewle and mesure be moderate. 
Þan kynges þat schulde be rewle 
and mesure of oþer men scholde principalliche be moderat. Chapter III 
For maners of children ben irekened 
and it is declared how kynges and princes schulde haue hemself to suche maners, 
it is to wetyng 
whiche ben þe maners of olde men 
and how kynges and princes scholde haue hemself to suche maners. 
And som maners of olde men 
ben good and som euele. 
And þe philosofer, ii Rethoricorum, 
among oþere maners of olde men 
þat he toucheth and rekeneth 
he toucheth sex euel maners. 
For first, olde men ben to ouertrowos – <surquydous> – and hard of byleue. 
Þe seconde, 
þei ben ful suspecious. 
Þe þridde, 
| þei ben ferful and pusillanimus. 
Þe ferþe, 
þei ben illeberal and chinches. 
Þe fifte, 
þei ben yuel of hope and of trist. 
Þe sexte, 
þei ben not schamefast 
but þei ben lest aschamed. First, olde men ben hard of bylyue, 
and þat cometh of assay; 
for þei ben expert and hauen assaied many thynges and knowen 
þat men lien ofte, 
and ben þerfore hard of bylyue and trowen 
þat al oþere men ben gylours. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
[ii Rethor]icorum, 
þat olde men hauen ileued many a Ʒeer 
and ofte ben desceyued and bygiled. 
Þanne for þis experiens and assay, 
þei ben hard of byleue. 
Þe seconde, 
olde men ben suspecious; and comynlyche al þat he seeþ he hath suspecioun 
þat it is euel 
and taketh it of þe worse side. 
It semeth þat olde men ben contrarie 
in disposicioun to children, 
for chidren hauen not ido manye euel dedes; 
but þei ben innocentƷ 
and demen by here 
awne innocence 
oþere men 
and taken alle dedes 
to þe bettre side and trowen þat alle men ben goode. 
But olde men doun þe contrarie, 
for þei hauen ileued longe tyme 
and hauen ofte ido euel dedes 
and demen dedes of [oþere] men 
by here owne euel dedes. 
Þerfore comounliche þei trowen þat oþere men ben euel and taken here 
dedes to þe worse side. 
Þerfore it is iseide, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þat for olde men 
hauen ileued longe tyme, 
it may not be but þei haue don many euel dedis 
and ben þerfore euel of suspexioun 
and gessen al thing to þe worse side. 
Þe þridde, 
olde men ben pusillanymes and ferful; 
and ben pusillanymes 
for þey ben ibrouƷt lowe | 
in þe lif; 
for by cause of longe leuynge, 
þei ben brouƷt lowe and faylen. 
Þanne 
as in hem faillen humours and lif, 
so in hem faillen þe herte of confort and ben þerfore pusillanimes and ferful. 
And for as it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
coold arayeth lif to ferfulnesse; 
for þe philosofre seith þat eche man 
[þat] is kyndeliche disposed 
as he is disposed 
in sum passioun 
is kyndelich passionate by þat passioun; 
þanne for ferfol men ben cold, 
eche man þat is kyndelich cold it semeþ and scheweþ 
þat he is kyndelich ferful. 
Þanne it schewiþ 
þat cold men ben kyndelich ferful 
for in hem kindelich hete failen 
and in here membris is kyndeliche colde. 
Þe ferþe, 
þei ben illiberal and chinches 
and þat is for þre causes: first, 
for defaute of lif; 
þe seconde, 
for experience of tyme; 
and þe þridde, 
for þei leuen not in hope 
but in mynde. 
For comonliche þe sowle folweth complexions of þe bodye. 
Þanne as olde men in here owne bodye faillen 
in humours and in lif, 
so þei dreden 
þat al here good faillen. 
Þan þey drede to suffre defaute and lacke, 
and dar not spende, 
and ben illiberal and chinches. 
And for þei seen 
þat þei hemself faillen 
and þei tristen not in here 
owne strengþe and myƷt 
but oonlych in here good and cataille, 
þanne, 
for al here trist is on hire good and catel, 
þai dar not spende. 
Also þei ben illiberal and chynches 
for experience of tyme, 
for it may wel be þat in here longe lif tyme þei hauen ofte ihadde lacke and defaute, 
and dreden þerfore lacke and defaute 
and ben illiberal and chinches. 
Also þei ben illiberal and chinches 
for þei | lyuen more in mynde þanne in hope, 
for þey thenken þat þei hauen longe ileued 
and þat þei schal lyue but a while. 
And for mynde is of thing 
þat is apassed and hope of thing 
þat is to comyng, 
þei lyuen not in hope 
but trusteth in good 
þat þei hauen <and tresteþ not in gode 
þat þei schul gete here after>, 
but lyueþ in mynde 
and in trist of god 
þat þei haue ygete, 
and trist nat in gode 
þat þei scholde gete here aftir, 
and ben þerfor illiberal and chinches 
and Ʒeueþ not gladlych awey 
þat þei hauen igete. 
Þe fifte, 
þei ben of euel hope 
and haue non gode hope 
and trist on þynges for þei trowen 
þat þey hemself 
and al thing schal faille 
þat hem nedeth. 
On case herof is assigned tofore. 
For Ʒif hope is of thing 
þat is to comynge, 
and mynde of thing 
þat is apassed, 
and olde men hauen ileued longe tyme and schal lyue but a while, 
and þat þei knowen, 
a‡ faile in hope 
and hauen in þouƷt 
þat þei schul not do manye grete dedes, 
and leue not, 
nother haueth likyng 
in hope but in mynde. 
And a signe herof 
is for eche man 
treteth gladliche of thinges 
in þe whiche he hath likyng. 
And we seen whan olde men ben gadred togeders, 
alwey þei talken of dedes 
þat þei hauen ido 
and hauen no likynge to talke of dedes 
þat þei schal do. 
For þey seen and knowen 
þat þei schal do 
but fewe dedes, 
and ben þerfore of hard hope; 
for þei faile in hope 
and hopen not to do many dedis. 
Þe vi, olde men ben schameles. 
For olde men ben illiberal and chinches and chargen thing 
þat is more profitable 
þan of thing 
þat is honest and studien of thing 
þat is more profit and grete þan to gete þe state of worschep, 
as þe philoso|fer meneth, 
ii Rethoricorum. 
Þanne for schamefastnesse 
is drede of lost of worschip, 
it longeth not to olde men for þey louen profit more þan worschipe. 
For þe hoole cause whi a man is schamefast 
it is for he wolde be moche itolde of 
and haue worschepe 
as þe philosofre meneth. 
And as olde men faillen in lif, 
in myƷte and in strengthe, 
in humours, 
and in kynde hete, 
so þei faillen in herte 
and in confort and reccheth 
not to be moche itolde of. 
And oo cause myƷt be assigned 
þat is som del comyne 
to al þat is iseid. 
For it is iseid 
þat olde men ben colde, 
and coold wasteth 
and constreyneth and in constreynyng it maketh hem 
þe more heuy and desire to lower place. 
And we seen þat þe elementes 
þat ben colde and heuy ben bynethe 
and hote elementes 
and liƷt ben aboue. 
Þanne olde men 
þat ben colde ben iprest togedres in hemself 
by cold and ben 
as it were inmeuable so 
þat þey dar not do, 
noþer trowe, 
noþer hope so 
þat þei recche not to be excellent noþer 
to be moche itolde of, 
for colde thinges hauen appetite 
to be bynethe and not aboue. 
For it is iknowe 
whiche ben þe euel maners of olde men, 
it may be sone iknowe [how] kynges and princes schulde haue hemself to suche maners. 
For it is iknowe þat kynges and princes scholde not in al thinges trowen tales 
to sone as children doun, 
Ʒut þey scholde not be suspecious noþer take al dedes to þe worse side; 
for þanne þei were cruel and vnmerciable 
and ihated of here sogettes. 
Þe þridde, 
þey scholde not be ferfol and pusillanymes, 
‡ modejles, 
| 
but he scholde be fortes, strong, and magnanimi. 
For þe nedes þat toucheth al þe regne 
(in þe whiche nedes kynges and princes schulde be occupied) 
ben grete and difficulte, 
it nedeth þat kynges 
and princes be fortes, strong, and magnanimi, grete. 
Þe ferþe, 
it is detestable 
Ʒif þey ben illiberal and chinches, 
for it is iseid tofore and declared 
atte þe folle 
in þe tretys of vertues 
þat kynges and princes scholde not oonlich be liberal, fortes, and moderat 
but also þei scholde be magnifici, 
swiþe noble and gret, 
and do grete dedes and workes. 
Þe fifte, 
þey scholde be of goode hope; 
for Ʒif þey trowen 
to faille in al thing, 
he wol assay no thing 
and þanne he putteth þe regne in peril. Þe sixte, 
þey scholde not be vnschamefast 
in þat manere as olde men ben and setten notby þe staatof worschip 
and ben more occupied 
in profitable dedes 
þan in worschepful dedes. 
Nathalees, 
þey scholde not be aschamed 
for þey scholde not do foule dedes 
of þe whiche cometh schame and velanye. Chapter IV 
For þe euel maners 
of olde men ben irekened, 
now here good maners schal be rekened. 
And it semeth þat þe philosofre, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
setteth foure maners of olde men 
þat may be preysed: first, for olde men hauen delectacioun (delit), remissioun (forgifte) and temporate; 
þe seconde, 
þey ben merciable; 
þe þridde, 
þei affermen non þynges 
þat þei ben inne dowt of; 
þe firth, 
þey do no dedis passyng mesure. 
For delectacioun and likyng of olde men – 
and namelich touchinge lechery 
(þat is lux[u]ria in Latyn) 
– is moo|derate and temporat for, 
as it iseid tofore, 
whan þe body is hoot, 
likynge in lecherie is strong. 
Þanne by þe contrarie, 
whanne þe body is cold, 
likynge in lecherie abateþ. 
For he þat desireth lecherie spendeth 
by appetite and streccheth in to oþere 
and þat is aƷenst þe resoun of cold. 
For cold, 
in þat it is cold, 
streccheth notin itself properliche noþer spendeþ 
but constreyneth and schrynketh in itsilf. 
Þanne by cause of colde, 
olde men schrynken in hemself 
and hauen moderat delectacioun and likyng; 
and herby it may be knowe 
how olde men ben illiberal and chinches. 
For by chincherie a man may do amys in twey maner wise: first, 
Ʒif he holdeth his owne 
oþer wise þanne resoun wolde. 
Þe seconde, 
Ʒif he desireth oþer wise 
þan resoun wolde to haue good 
þat he hath not. 
Olde men trespasseth more by chincherie in holdyng here owne good þanne in desiryng vntheweliche good 
þat þey hauen not, 
for by cold thei schrynken more in hemself 
þan streccheth hemself to oþere. 
And for þe soule 
in al his worching vsen in som wise a bodiliche lyme and instrument – 
as in woork of craft Ʒif þe instrument is ichaunged, 
þe worching chaungeth – so in worching of þe soule, 
Ʒif þe body chaungeth, 
þe soule folewyth þe complexioun of þe body 
and his worchinge chaungeth. 
Þanne Ʒif þe body is cold by appetite, 
þe soule is inclined 
to folwe þe kynde of coold; 
and for coold is constreyned 
and ischronke in itself, 
þerfore olde men 
by cause of cold hauen slak delectacioun and likynge 
as þe philosofre wol mene, 
ii Rethoricorum. 
Þe secunde, 
oolde men ben merciable; 
but as þe philosofer | seith, 
olde men and children 
be not merciable 
for þe same cause. 
For children ben merciable for frendschip 
and olde men for feblenesse, 
for eche man is merciable 
to his frend 
and hath reuthe of hym 
þat þey wenen þat hath harm with wrong. 
Þanne for children louen frendschipe 
and demen 
by here innocence oþer men, 
and troweth þat al men ben goode, wherfore whan men hauen harm, 
þey wenen þat it is with wrong 
and hauen þerfore sone mercye and reuþe of hem. 
But olde men ben not merciable in þis wise, 
for he troweth þat oþere men ben good noþer 
for loue of frendschipe, 
but for eche man 
þat is feble 
and faileþ desiren 
þat oþer men schulde haue mercye 
and rewþe of hym, 
and þerfore he is inclined 
to haue mercye and reuthe of oþere men. 
And so oolde men, 
for þei ben feble and wolde þat oþere men 
scholde haue mercy 
and rewþe of hem, 
þei hauen sone mercie and reuthe of oþere men. 
Þe þridde, no thing þat is in doute 
þei affermen certeynliche. 
For as þe philosofre seith, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
for olde men hauen ileued longe tyme and iseye moche 
and ofte hauen be bygeled, 
þey dar not afferme here sawes and menyng certeynliche 
for þey dreden it be not so 
and þat þey be desceyued 
in manye manere wise. 
Þerfore, ii Rethoricorum, 
þe philosofre seith 
þat olde men Ʒeuen dom of al thing with doute and setteþ alwey 
as it were a condicioun 
and seith no thing 
certeynliche noþer stabilliche. 
For whanne me axeth of hem eny thing, 
þey seyen on caas it is so, 
oþer it may wel be. 
And so in som wise 
þey dreden to be disceyued 
and Ʒeuen non answere certeyneliche and stedefastliche. 
Þe ferþe, 
þey doun no dedes passynge mesure 
but in alle here workes and dedes | 
þey semen temporate. 
For as children, 
þat hauen to moche blood and passyng delectacions and passions 
in al doyng, passeth and ouerdoþ, 
so oolde men, 
for here passions and delectacions ben moderate, 
comounliche þey doun alle dedes moderatliche. 
For it is iknowe 
whiche ben þe maners of yong men and of oolde men, 
it may be sone iknowe whiche ben þe maners of men 
of mene age bytwene children and olde men. 
As þe philosofer meneþ, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þey hauen al þat is to preysyng in children 
and in olde men, 
for þei ben not passyng hote as children 
noþer passyng coolde as olde men, 
noþer passyng bolde and hardy as children 
noþer ferful and cowardes as olde men, 
but þey ben mene bytwene bothe; 
for he dredeth þere it is to dredyng and ben hardy 
þer þey scholde be hardy. 
So, 
for þei ben not alle inexpert as children, 
noþer so ofte disceyued as olde men, 
noþer trowen al men as children doun for defaute of experience and of assaye, 
noþer ben in al wise so hard of beleue as oolde men 
þat ben ofte desceyued, 
but þey ben in þe mene, 
þerfore, ii Rethoricorum, 
it is iseid 
þat men of mene age trowen not al men 
nother ben hard of byleue to al men 
but þey demen by sothnesse and trouþe. 
Also, 
for þei ben mene bytwene children and olde men, 
þei ben not intemporat as children 
noþer ferfol and feble as olde men; 
but, as it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þei ben strong with temporancia 
and temporate with strengþe. 
Þanne schortliche for to speke, 
al þat is to preisyng in children 
oþer in olde men 
is ifounde in men of mene age, 
and no thing 
þat is to blamyng in children 
oþer in olde men 
is | ifounde in men of mene age. 
For as it is iseid tofore 
þat alwey to moche and to lyte 
is to blamynge, 
þanne Ʒif in olde men 
oþer in children ouƷt is to preisyng, 
þat is for he goth not to fer 
fro þe mene; 
and Ʒif ouƷt in hem is to blamyng, 
þat is for þey ben fer fro þe mene and doþ to moche oþer to luyte. 
Wherfore Ʒif eny mene is in children 
oþer in olde men, 
it is more parfit in men of mene age 
for ━al┐ ━þat┐ is to preysyng 
in hem is holliche ifounde in men of mene age. 
Also no thing 
þat is in hem to moche oþer to lyte is ifounde in hem 
þat hath of mene age. 
And no thing þat is to blamyng 
in hem is ifounde in men of mene age. 
And in þis wise it is to spekyng of maners of men. 
But suche wordes schal not alwey be ‡ vnderstonde 
as necessarie and nedeful menyng þat olde men 
myƷte not be liberal and magnanimy 
and þat children 
myƷte not be temporat and stedefast, 
but he schal be vnderstonde 
by a manere disposicioun and inclinacioun; 
for by cours and ordre of kynde we seen that children and olde men and men of mene age 
hauen disposicioun and inclinacioun 
to maners acordynge to here age 
as it is declared tofore. 
For it is iknowe, 
it may be sone iknowe 
how kynges and princes scholde haue hemself to suche maners and þewes. 
For þei scholde haue þe good. 
For kynges and princes scholde lyue more by resoun 
þan by passioun, 
here lust and likynge schulde be temporate. 
For it is iseid tofore 
þat strong lust and likynge smyteth and blyndeþ resoun. 
And þey schulde be merciable, 
not for defaute noþer for feblenesse 
3but for good and | profite of þe regne 
þat þey may be loued of hem 
þat ben in þe regne. 
For al þe regne 
is imeued to louye 
þe kyng Ʒif þey seen hym mylde and merciable. 
Þe þridde, kynges and princes scholde not afferme and meyntene 
þe oon partie of þyng 
þat is in doute 
ne desire to be holde wyse and redye. 
Þe ferþe, 
they scholde be moderat 
and temperate 
in here workes and dedes; 
for, 
as it is iseid, 
þei scholde be ensample of leuyng 
and rewle of oþere men. 
Þanne sum maners of children 
and of olde men 
schal be chose 
and summe forsake; 
but of hem þat ben of mene age 
al maners ben in sum wyse to presyng. 
And we seyen in sum wise 
for thei children 
and olde men haue a manere inclinacioun to euel maners and þewes, 
Ʒut þey may do ayenst 
þat inclynacioun and folwe good maners and þewes. 
So men of mene age may haue inclinacioun and appetite corrupte 
and folwe euele maners and þewes. 
Wherfore Ʒif me scholde haue lordschipe 
by resoun and vnderstondyng, 
kynges and princes 
þat ben lordes of oþere men 
scholde folwe good maners 
and þewes 
by dom and ordre of resoun. Chapter V 
As it longeth to þis doynge, 
we may rekene foure good maners 
of ientel men and noble. 
For first, 
þei ben magnanimi; 
þe seconde, magnifici, noble; 
þe þridde, 
þey lernen and [ben] sleyƷ; 
þe ferþe, 
þei ben politik (wis) and gode to speke with. 
Ientel men and noble ben magnanimi for as þe philosofer meneþ, 
primo et ii Rethoricorum, 
ientilesse and noblesse 
is a vertue of ientil blode. 
And som ben cleped nobil 
and gentil for þei ben icome of gentil blod 
and worschepful as þe ‡ | philosofer meneth, 
ii Rethoricorum. 
And þat blood is cleped worschepful blood 
[i]f many worthi men 
and worschepful come 
of þat blood in oolde tyme. 
Þanne þe vertue of ientel blood 
þat þe philosofre clepeth noblenesse is not elles but be icome of sum kynde oþer blood 
in þe whiche kynde and blood were manye princes 
and manye grete men and worthi 
in olde tyme and duryng fram olde tyme. 
Þanne so it is to wetynge of ientilesse and noblenesse. 
And for by comyn composicioun of men 
al monye and richesse semeth þe prise of eche thing 
(for by cause þat som men ben riche, 
þey ben iholde worthi to be princes 
and ben þerfore iholde solempne men 
and worthi honour and worschipe), 
þanne for by comun menynge of men, 
ientelnesse and noblenesse is not elles but oolde blood igrounded in richesse. 
Þanne for noble men 
of olde tyme were souereynes and manye of here 
kyn and blood were solempne men and riche, 
þerfore by ensample of þe forfadres 
þe ientelere 
a noble mannys herte is arered, 
a‡ fondeth to do grete dedes 
and to be in gret worschep. 
For it is kyndeliche 
þat þe effecte be ileche to þe cause; 
þat is to menyng 
þat þe makynge be ileche to þe maker. 
Þanne for þe children 
ben þe effecte of þe fadres and modres, 
it is kyndeliche þat children folwe fadres and modres. Wherfore gentil men and noble, 
knowynge þat of here kynne and blood were manye solempne men and worthi, 
[and fondyng] 
for to be suche 
as here forfaders 
were and oþere of here kynne, 
a‡ desiren and fonden and doon passynge | 
grete dedes and ben magnanimi. 
Þe secounde, noble men ben not oonli[c]h magnanimi 
and grete herted 
but also Ʒif they 
[ha]n wherewith, 
þey ben magnifici, 
swithe noble, 
and maken grete workes. 
For alwey Ʒif oþere thinges ben ileche, 
þe children ben more noble 
þanne þe fadres. 
For, 
as it is iseid 
by þe comune menynge, 
ientelnesse and nobelnesse is not elles but olde richesse, 
oþer olde good igrounded in richesse, 
oþer vertue in worthinesse 
of kynne and of blood. 
And mannes kyn and blood is most worthi Ʒif 
it is swithe riche 
and was riche of olde tyme. 
Þanne for oon 
is þe firste of som mannes forfadres 
þat was iholde riche 
and bygan to be riche, 
þanne þe more fer þe children 
þat comen of þat stok 
ben fram þat stok, 
þe lasse mynde men hauen þat such children 
forfadres were pore. 
Þerfore alwey ientellesse and noblenesse 
is more 
and more for alwey 
þe richesse is more oolde in þe children 
þan in þe fadres. 
Wherfore, 
for þe noblesse inclineþ 
þe herte of noble men 
to make gret workes, 
it folweth þat noble men ben magnifici 
and in som wise more magnifici, gret, þan here fadres. 
Þerefore noble men 
ben not onliche magnifici 
but also þei fonden 
to make grettere workes 
þanne here fadres. 
Þerfore, iiii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer seith þat magnanimus scholde be magnificus, 
noble and glorious, 
and he þ[er] meneth þat noble men 
by here noblenesse schulde folwe togedres 
as magnanimi and magnifici. 
Þe þridde, noble men lerneth wel and ben sleyƷ and wise and þat is for double cause. 
On is mete and drynke 
þat þei ben feed and norsched with, 
| and warde and kepyng of þe body. 
Þe oþer cause is conuersacioun and companye of oþere men. 
For noble men ben norsched and ifed with grete besinesse 
and kepeth here owne bodye besiliche, 
it is semeliche 
þat þey haue þe body 
wel desposed with good complexioun. 
And for men with tendre 
flesche.and skyn ben wel desposed in sowle and wit, 
as þe philosofer meneth, 
ii De Anima, 
tendre men hauen þe soule wel disposed and lemen wel and ben sliƷ and wise for þei hauen tendre flesch and skyn and good complexioun. 
Also, 
for þat is for conuersacioun and companye of oþere men, 
for noble men hauen manye onlokers 
þat taken hede of here dedes 
and ben þerfore excited to avise hem scleliche 
and to lerne what he schulde doo 
þat here dedes 
be not iblamed 
for manye taketh hede of here dedes, 
wherfore by cause of besy avisement 
and consideracioun of here dedes, 
þey lernen wel and ben sleyƷ and wise. 
Hereby it may be iknowe how gretliche flaterers 
scholde be ihated 
þat preysen alle dedes of oþere men. 
And for ientil men ben not reproued, 
but flaterers preisen here euele dedes, 
and ben disposed to vnknowe hemself 
and to folwe here owne wille and not resoun, 
þanne noble men scholde lerne wel 
and be sleiƷ and wise 
and so drede repreues 
and be avised besiliche 
what is to doyng. 
Þe ferthe, noble men ben politik and affabiles, 
good to speke with. 
For comynliche in courtes of noble men 
is greet companye 
and ben politik and companable 
for comynliche thei leuen in companye. 
For as cherles [þat] leuen as þei it were solutarie men 
withoute companye ben | boistous and boynardes, 
so noble men doun 
þe contrarie and leuen in companye 
and ben companable 
and good to speke with. 
And how kynges and princes schulde haue þes maners 
þat ben good 
it is tofore declared at þe folle. 
For we seide tofore 
how eche kyng scholde be magnanimus, 
how magnificus, how prudens, 
and leme wel, 
and how affabilis 
and good to speke with, 
and companable. 
For it is iknowe whiche maners 
of noble men ben good, 
it is to wetyng whiche maners 
of hem ben euel. 
And þe philosofer, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
tellen twey euel maners of hem: 
for noble men desiren to grete worschep; 
þe seconde, 
for he despiseth here owne forfadres. 
For it is kyndeliche to eche man 
þat he wol gadry more good 
to þe good 
þat he hath, 
þerfore þei 
þat begynnen to be riche 
wolde be more riche 
and þei 
þat ben worschepful 
wolde be more worschepful. 
Þanne for by cause of kyn 
and of blood noble men 
ben acounted worschepful, 
þerfore þei wol gadry more good to þe good 
þat þei hauen for thei wolde be more worschepful and desire 
þerfore to grete worschep. 
Þe seconde, 
þei ben proute and despisen here forfadres, 
for comonliche noble men hauen hemself grettere þan here owne fadres. 
And þat is for alwey ientellesse and noblenesse 
þat is of long tyme 
is more þan gentellesse and noblenesse of schort tyme. 
And alwey þe more olde ientelnesse maken men proute 
and despise here owne forfadres 
and desire to grete worschipe, 
and he semeth of euel maners; 
for we schal not desire worschip in itself 
for so don proute men and stoute. 
But we schal do | werkes 
þat ben worthi worschipe 
as vertues men don and magnanimi. 
Þanne for kynges and princes mowe not be kyndeliche lordes 
but thei ben good and vertuous, 
þei scholde folwe þe goode maneres of ientel men 
and noble 
for to be magnanimi, magnifici, prudentes, and affabiles, 
good to speke with, 
and forsake euel maners, 
and be not proute noþer despice oþere men. Chapter VI The philosofre meneth, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
five euel maners of riche men. First, 
for riche men ben proute. 
Þe seconde, 
for þei ben dispitous. 
Þe þridde, 
for þei ben nesche and intemporate. 
Þe ferþe, 
þei ben bosters 
and despisen oþere men. 
Þe fifte, 
þei holden hemself worthi to be princes. 
And riche men ben proute; 
for as þe philosofer seith, 
þei ben so disposed 
for þei hauen richesse 
þei wenen 
þat þei hauen al good. 
Þan it is wel iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þat richesse 
is as it were 
þe pris of worthinesse of oþer thinges. 
And by þe comyn opynyoun 
þat al þyng is meete 
and imesured by moneye and al þat may be preysed 
is ipreysed 
by pris of penyes or of pans, 
þerfore þey þat hauen money wenen þat þei haue al good 
for þey accounten and holden moneye dignite and pris of al oþere and ben þerfore proute and stoute of herte. 
Þe seconde, riche men ben despituous; 
for foif] þei ben proute 
and wolle be holde excellent, 
and for a man wol be holde excellent 
Ʒif he may despise and do despit to oþere men, 
and riche men, 
for to be seye aboue oþere men, 
þe[i] ben ameued 
to despise oþere men. 
Þe þridde, riche men ben nesche and | intemperate. 
And þat is for delicate leuynge, 
for comonliche þey leuen so delicatliche 
þat þei mowe suffre no greef 
and ben þerfore passionate and faillen, 
and folwen passions, 
and mowe not withstonde passions. 
For thei vsen to leue delicatliche and withoute greef 
and ben þerfore 
not manliche noþer temporat, 
but þei ben wommanliche and nesche and tender and folwen passions. 
Þe ferþe, riche men ben bosters 
and despisen oþer men. 
For as þe philosofre meneþ, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þei hauen grettest excityng 
for to be suche. 
For wise men in here 
nedes hauen nede to riche men good, 
and þerfore riche men 
ben proute of herte 
and despisen oþere and trowen 
þat þei ben abouen oþere, 
for oþere men 
hauen nede to here good. 
And secundo Rethoricorum, 
þe philosofre seith þat it was axed of a certeyn womman 
wheþer it were bettere 
to be riche oþer wise. 
And þe womman answerede and seide 
þat he hath oftere iseie wise men come to riche men 
Ʒeates þan riche men to wise men Ʒeates. 
Þanne for richesse 
is most sencible good, 
þe comynte þat knoweth not 
but sencible good 
acounteþ richesse most excellent good 
and setteþ richesse 
tofore oþere good. 
Þe fifte, riche men holden hemself worthi to be princes. 
For as þe philosofre seith, 
þei wenen þat þei hauen þat thing 
wherfore a man 
is worthi to be prince; 
for he weneth 
þat þe dignite of principate is richesse. 
For it semeth hem þat richesse is greet good, 
þat eche man 
þat haþ þerof inow is worthi to be a prince. 
Þanne riche men hauen | 
al þes euel maners, 
for þey ben so disposed 
þat þei wenen 
þat richesse 
is more good 
þan it is. 
And kynges and princes scholde forsake þe[s] euel maneres; 
for þei þei haue grete richesse, 
þey ben not þerfore excellent noþer 
he scholde þerfore trowe 
þat þei ben worthi to be princes. 
For þe dignite and worthinesse of principate 
stondeþ principalliche in vertues and in prudencia 
þat ben inward good 
and stondeþ not principalliche in richesse 
þat is outward good. 
And Ʒif richesse 
is ordeyned to workes of vertues, 
þanne he serueth and helpeth 
to oure felicite 
and is instrument þerto and maketh it 
þe more cleere. 
But Ʒif richesse isordeyned tobost and toprude, 
oþer to despise oþer men, 
oþer to intemporatnesse, 
oþer to oþere vicious workes, 
þanne by rechesse a man is infelix, 
a wrecche and not felix. 
Þanne a man is holde worthi 
to be a prince 
Ʒif he is good and prudens 
and not for he hath moche richesse. Wherfore kynges and princes 
[ben not worthi to be princes] 
but þei leue and forsake þe euel maners of riche men 
and but þei ordeyne here rechesse to a good ende 
and to vertues workes and dedes. 
For it is iknowe whiche ben þe euel maneres of riche men, 
and þat kynges and princes 
scholde forsake suche maners of riche men, 
it is to wetyng 
whiche ben þe good maners of riche men. 
ii Rethoricorum, 
it semeth þat þe philosofre wolde mene þat riche men hauen 
but oon good manere alone 
and þat is for þei beren hem wel in Goddes seruice. 
An[d] for richesse is gode of fortune, 
it semeth þat sleyþe and witte of mankynde 
suffiseth not to make a man riche; 
for we seen som tyme | sum men 
þat ben more wise 
and sleiƷ ben lasse riche. 
Þanne for getynge of richesse is in þat wise 
as it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þei menen þat richesse 
þat cometh 
by destenye and ordinaunce of God more 
þan by besynesse and wit of mankynde. 
Þanne it is skile and resoun 
þat riche men bere hemself wel in Goddes seruice. 
And þat is þat is iseide, 
ii Rethoricorum, þat oon is þe beste manere of riche men 
for þei hauen hemsilf wel in Goddes seruice trowynge in som wise 
þat þey hauen suche good 
by destenye and ordinaunce of God. 
And we schal besiliche take hede 
of suche speche of philosofie; 
for richesse and al good 
þat we hauen, 
[we hauen] 
by Ʒift and ordinaunce of God more þan by oure owne besynesse and witte. 
And Ʒif thei toke good hede 
þerto in makyng of gret workes 
by worschep of God, 
þey scholde noƷt trowe 
þat þei Ʒeue to God of here good, 
but þei scholde haue more in mynde þa[t] þei paien to God 
som of þe gode 
þat þey hauen fonge of his Ʒifte. 
And þis good manere to do wel in Goddes seruice scholde kynges and princes haue; 
and of þe moo thinges 
þei mote Ʒeue rekenyng to þe heƷinge, 
þe more þei ben holde to haue þis manere. Chapter VII Gentelnesse, noblenesse, richesse, cyuyle power 
and myƷthe ben acounted among outward good, 
for riche men be more studios 
and more good þan þei be myƷti. 
Sum men beþ ‡ noble 
for þei ben come of worþi kin and beþ not riche; 
and sum been riche and beþ noƷt noble, 
for þei ben [not] cum of nobele kyn. 
But as it is iseid tofore, 
it is not oon to be noble 
and to be myƷty noþer to be riche and to be myƷty; 
for a man is myƷty for he | 
is in som principate 
and hath manye men 
vnder his lordschipe. 
And for we seen manye nobie men 
vnmigty and mowe not be princes, 
þanne it is not oon to be noble 
and to be myƷty. 
Also we seen manye men riche 
of gold and of siluer, 
of lond and of vynegerdes, 
and lacken cyuyle myƷt and power 
and ben irewled vnder hestes of oon. 
Wherfore it is not on to be riche and to be myƷty. 
For it is iknowe whiche ben þe maners of noble men and of riche men, 
it is to wetynge 
whiche ben þe maners of myƷty men. 
For, ii Rethoricorum, 
þe philosofre wol mene 
þat myƷty men 
hauen bettre maners þan riche men. 
Andþe philosofre speketh ofþre 
in þe whiche þe maners of myƷty men passen þe maners of riche men: 
first, 
for myƷty men ben more studios þan riche men; þe seconde, 
þei ben more temporat; 
þe þridde, 
þei ben lasse despitous. 
Þei ben more studios 
and more good þan riche men, 
but þe philosofre meneth 
þat þei ben compelled to take hede to þynges 
þat longeth to dedes of myƷty men. 
For he þat is in som staat of myƷt oþer in som principate, 
for he is a comune persone 
and a solempne and manye hauen eiƷe to hym, 
he is aschamed to passe al fro þe mene and to do not vertuos dedes. 
Þanne principate bryngeth a man 
in som wise 
to be good and riƷtful. 
Þanne myƷty men ben more studious þanne riche men, 
for þei ben compelled to take hede 
to workes and dedes of myƷt 
þat scholde be good and studios. 
Þe seconde, myƷty men ben more temporat þan riche men. 
For whan a man Ʒeueth hym to outward | doynge, 
he is withdrawe fram ydelnesse; 
and whanne þei Ʒeuen hem to on werke, 
he is withdrawe fro oþere. 
Þan Ʒif riche men 
ben not compelled to take hede 
to workes 
and dedes of riƷtwisnesse, 
þanne þey ben ful idel 
and ben sone inclined to lecherie 
and ben intemporate. 
Þanne for myƷty men and princes mote take hede 
to outward besynesse, 
þey mowe not Ʒeue hemself al to lecherie. 
Wherfore myƷty men ben more temporate þan riche men. 
Þe þridde, 
myƷty men ben lasse despitous þan riche men. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þat Ʒif a myƷtty man doþ wrong, 
he doþ no wrong 
in smale thinges 
but in grete. 
For a myƷty man is in principate 
and in a greet astate of worschep 
and taketh not hede bote 
to excellent and passyng greet doyng. 
Þerfore Ʒif it happeth 
þat he dooþ greet wrong to oþere, 
he doþ not wrong in smale thinges 
but in grete. 
For he telleth no pris to doo greef and harme 
for he doþ no gree[f] to oþer men and damage 
oþer he doþ greet harme and damage. 
Þanne myƷty men ben lasse despitous þan riche men, 
for þei tellen no pris to do al manere despit and harme; 
but þei ben onlich despitous 
to do gret despit and harm. 
Þanne þe maners of riche men 
ben in alle wise worse 
þan þe maneres of noble men 
oþer of myƷti men. 
Þerfore comonliche myƷt and ientelnesse 
folweth not richesse, 
but ofte by richesse a man is a wrecche and not felix. 
For he þat is so riche and not noble, 
nother is in myghte nother in principate, 
is comynliche intemporate and vnwise 
and is an vnwise felix 
and fortunate vnwise. 
For Ʒif a riche man 
is not noble noþer | come of olde worthi kyn bute 
he is late imade riche 
he is cleped an vnwise felix, 
for he can not vse þe rycheise 
þat is instrument to felicite. 
Oþer he is icleped an vnwis fortunate man, 
for he can not haue hymself 
as he scholde in riches 
þat is good and catel þat [is] of fortune. 
Þerfore it is iseide, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þat he þat is late imade riche is vnlered 
in vse of richesse, 
for þey þat ben late imade riche ben vnlered 
how þei schulle vse richesse. 
Þerfore it is iseid 
in þe same book, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þat þe maners of richesse, 
schoitliche to speke, 
ben þe maners of a ‡ man 
þat is vnwis and felix. 
Þanne þerfore noblenesse and ientelnesse 
is asocied to richesse, 
for he þat is bothe riche and noble and icome of oold noble blood 
and his forfadres were riche, 
he can þe bettre vse richesse 
and is þerfore not to proute. 
And it semeth þat sencible good 
is al contrarie to science and to vertues, 
for ar a man haue sencible richesse 
and good he telleth more pris þerof þanne 
it is worthi 
and tel not so moche pris 
whan he hath it. 
But of science and of vertues falleþ þe contrarie, 
for or a man haue science 
and vertue he telleþ 
but litel pris þerof; 
but whan he hath hem, 
he telleth gret pris þerof 
and more þanne he dede 
or he hadde hem. 
For he þat begynneth to taste þe swetnesse of vertues and of science anon he perseyueth 
þat þei ben bettre 
þan he trowed. 
Þanne þe more sencible good 
þat a man hath, 
þe lasse pris he telleth þerof. 
Wherfore by cause of riche men 
of olde tyme ben more ivsed to richesse 
þan men 
þat ben late imade riche, 
þerfore he telleth not so greet pris of riches 
noþer ben so proude þerof 
as men 
þat | ben late ymaad riche. 
Þanne for a man scholde not be vnwis felix 
and for he schulde 
kunne take fortune 
as he schulde, 
it is spedful 
þat gentilnesse and myƷt be iyuned to rychesse. 
For a riche noble man of olde tyme 
can bettre haue hemself 
in alle thinges 
þan can a cherle 
þat is newelich imad riche. 
Þanne it is wel iseyd 
for a riche man 
schulde not be vnwis felix, 
it nedeþ þat he be noble; 
and for he scholde not be intemporat, 
it nedeth þat he be myƷty. 
For as it is iseid tofore honde, 
myƷty men scholde be temporate. 
For comonliche kynges and princes hauen inow of þes 
þre outward manere good of richesse, noblenesse, and myƷt, 
thei scholde be ilered and temporat. 
For by noblenesse þei hauen richesse 
inow of olde tyme and cunneth þerfore bere hemself 
þe bettre in fortune and bysette and rewle richesse 
þe more rediliche and wisliche. 
Also, 
for þei ben in principate and in myƷt, 
he mot haue diuers besinesse 
and ben þerfore withdrawe fram lecherie 
and so ibrouƷt to be temporate. 
Þanne so it is to menyng of maners. 
For children, and olde men, 
and men of mene age, 
myƷty men, noble, and riche, 
hauen suche maners 
as we hauen iseid – 
but not þat þei ben al suche, 
noþer we menen that þei ben al suche; but for comonlich þe maners of riche men, 
of noble men, 
and of oþere ben suche, 
as we hauen of iseid. 
Also þeiƷ it be not necessarie 
and nedfol 
þat þei haue suche maners, 
Ʒit þei ben moche inclyned to folwe such maners. 
Þanne we prayen children and olde men 
þat þei hauen non indignacioun, 
þeiƷ we speke of suche | maners of hem. 
For we menen not þat þei mote 
nede folwe suche maners, 
but we menen þat children 
and olde men 
may forsake alle euele maners 
and folwe þe ordres of reson. 
Also noble men and riche schulde not haue indignacioun 
þey we rekene sume of here euel maners; 
for it nedeth not þat þei be suche, 
bote it suffiseth 
þat in manye of hem 
ben suche maners ifounde. 
For we menen þat bi suche maners 
þei hauen inclinacioun 
and not nessessite 
to folwe suche maners. 
For goode maners and euel ben irekened 
by diuerce agis and diuerce status, 
al men scholde folwe good maneres 
and forsake euel maneres. 
And in þe more gret [gree] kynges and princes ben iset, 
þe more þey scholde folwe good maneres 
and forsake euel maneres. 
For, 
as it is iseid tofore, 
þei scholde be forme and ensample of leuyng. 
Þanne al þat is to preysyng in maners of al oþere men scholde be holliche 
in hem more excellentliche and more parfitliche. Explicit liber primus. Plate II: Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Digby 233, fol. 62r Book II Book II Part I DOI: 10.4324/9781315861739-72 
Þat it is kyndelich to man to lyue in companye and þat | kynges and f. 62r princes scholde besiliche take heede þerto. 
What is comynte of an hous and how suche comynte is nedful in þe lyf of mankynde. 
Þat þe comynte of an hous 
is in som wise þe firste comynte 
and a kyndelich comynte 
and þat kynges and princes 
and alle citeseyns scholde þat iknowe. 
Whiche is þe comynte of hous, 
and þat an hous ‡ moot be of manye persones. 
Þat an hous mot be of twey comyntees 
and of þre manere persones. 
Þat in an hous mot be þre comyntees 
and foure manere of persones 
and þre manere of reulyng, 
and þis mot be deled in þre parties. Þat man is kyndelich 
a best of wedlok, 
and he þat wol not weddy noþer be wedded leuen not as men 
but as beestes oþer as goddys. 
That al ‡ citeseins 
and namelich kynges and princes scholde holde hem to here 
wyues withowte departyng. 
Þat eche citeseyn 
and namelich kyng 
oþer prince 
scholde hold hym apayed with on wif | alone. 
And þat ech citeseyns wif and nameliche kynges 
oþer princes 
wif scholde holde here apaied with on housebonde. 
Þat alle citeseyns and nameliche kynges and princes scholde not take wyues of here owne kynne. How kynges and princes 
and alle citeseyns scholde take wifes 
yhigt with outward good and catel. 
How alle citeseins and nameliche kynges and princes scholde fonde to haue in here wifes 
not onliche outward good 
but also inward good bothe of body and of soule. 
That alle þe citeseins and namlich kynges and princes 
schulde not rewle here 
wyues and children in on manere wyse. 
That alle citeseins and namlich kynges and princes scholde not reule here wifes and seruantes 
in oon manere wise. 
That it is vnsemelich 
to alle citeseyns and namelich to kynges and princes to vse þe work of matrimoyne 
in age of greet 30uþe. 
Þat þe dede of getyng of children 
scholde more be do in colde tyme | 
whanne þe wynd is norþ þanne in hote tyme 
whanne þe wynd is south. 
That in wymmen 
som what is to preysyng 
and som what is to blamyng. 
Howe alle citeseins and nameliche kynges 
and princes schulde rewle here wifes. 
How al citeseins and nameliche kynges 
and princes schulde haue hem to here wifes. 
How wifes scholde array hire owne body. 
How no cyteseins noþer kynges noþer princes scholde be to ieious of here wyues. 
Whiche is þe counsaille of wymmen 
and how it is alwey 
not to doyng 
by here counsaille but in happe. 
That it is not semelich to kynges and princes 
noþer to oþer citeseins 
to telle here 
preuey counseille 
to here owne wifes. 
Here bygynneth the seconde book 
þe whiche techeth 
how a prince and eche man schal reule his maynye in his hous. Chapter I 
The mater of þis first book 
is digeste and declared, 
for þerinne it is declared where inne kynges and princes schulde sette here felicite 
and what vertues he schulde haue 
and whaat passions 
þei scholde folwe 
and what maneres þey scholde vse. 
And by þes foure it is declared 
at þe folle 
how eche man scholde reule hemself 
and how he scholde be in hymself. 
Þan it is to spekyng of rewlyng 
of manye and of hous, 
for it is not inow þat kynges 
and princes be good in hemself 
but þei be also good 
to oþere men 
and but þey cunne rewle | also oþere men. 
Noþer it is inow þat kynges and princes reule wel [hemself] 
but þei kunne rewle hous, regne and cite. 
Þerfore in þe seconde book 
we schal determyne of rewlyng of hows and of maynee. 
But for hous and maynye is a certeyn comynte 
as it is a kyndelich comynte, 
Ʒif we wole determyne of hous, 
it is to wetynge 
how man scholde be comunatif. 
Þerfore it is to wetynge 
þat passynge 
oþere bestes man 
nedeþ foure by þe whiche we may in foure manere wise preue 
þat man is kyndeliche comunycatif and companable. 
Þe firste is itake 
by mete and drynke 
þat man nedeþ; 
þe seconde, 
by clothing þat man heleth; 
þe þridde, 
by puttynge of of greues and lettes 
by þe whiche man is saued fro enemyes; 
þe ferþe, 
by lore and by speche 
by þe whiche man lemeth 
and is itauöt. 
Þanne we schal imagene in þis wise 
þat kynde doþ no thing 
an idel in þyng 
þat is kyndeliche, 
and þilke ben kyndelich withoute þe whiche thing 
may not be saued 
and kepte in beynge; 
for kynde dude and wrouƷte an idel Ʒif kyndelich thinges 
were in no wise isaued 
and ikepte in beynge 
but after þat he were imaad anon he scholde faille and be destroied. 
Þanne for leuynge is kyndelich to man, 
þanne al þat ben imaad to good lyuynge 
withoute þe whiche man 
is not suffisaunt to hymsilf 
in his lif ben kyndeliche [to] man. 
And among oþere þat helpeth to manis lif companye is acounted. 
Þanne man is kyndeliche a companable beest, 
and þat companye helpeth most 
to suffisant of mannis lif 
it may be preued by þes foure 
þat | ben irekened tofore hond 
þe whiche foure ben nedeful to man 
oþer wise þan to oþere beestes. 
Þe firste is take 
by mete and drynke þat man nedeþ, 
for among oþere bestes 
a man hath best touche and best complexioun. 
Þerfore among alle bestes man 
nedeth mete craftyliche imaad, 
for to oþere beestes 
kynde Ʒeueth mete kyndeliche, 
as þe beestes 
þat lyueth not by raueyne – 
as to scheep, reþeren, 
and to oþere suche bestes 
kynde Ʒeueth 
herbes,graas and fruitþat suffiseth tomete 
withoute oþerarayenge and greythinge. 
And to bestes þat lyuen by raueyne 
as þe wolf and lyons 
and to oþere suche beestes 
kynde Ʒeueth mete of oþere beestes 
þat ben kyndeliche gendred and ibred. 
Þanne in som wise 
to alle bestes kynde arayeth mete at þe folle. 
Bote by cause þat þei ben not so pure complexioun 
and so temporate 
as man hath and nedeþ 
not so pure mete and clene 
as man nedeth, 
wherfore mete of oþere bestes suffiseth to here lif as it is greyþed 
and arayed by kynde wiþoute oþer crafty seething oþer arayeng. 
And for man haþ more pure and clene complexioun 
and more temporat, 
hym nedeþ mete þat is arayed and igreyþed. 
Þanne þeiƷ whete þat cometh forþ 
by kynde be suffisaunt mete to oþere beestes, 
it is not suffisant mete to man 
but it be arayed and ipured. Þerfore 
it is igrounde and ipured and breed is imaad 
þerof and ibake 
þat it be good meete to man. 
<And> for <oo person suffyseþ not to alle þys, 
þerfore> by cause of mete 
þat mot [not] be suffisant, 
man nedeth companye <‡> 
þat eche man helpe oþere at nede; 
and þis þat is iseid 
of whete schal be 
vnderston|de of oþere mete, 
for neuer man by hymself alone 
suffiseth to hymself 
to haue couenable mete 
þat nedeth to his lif. 
Þanne it is wel iseid 
þat for mete þat vs nedeþ, 
man is kyndelich a companable best. Þe seconde meene for to preue þe same is itake by clothing 
þat helieth vs. 
For as kynde Ʒeueþ sufficiantliche to oþer bestes mete, 
so it semeþ þat he Ʒeueþ hem cloþyng; 
for it semeþ þat bestes and foules hauen 
as it were kynde cloþyng 
as wolle and fetheres. 
And kynde ordeyneth not sufficiantliche clothing for man, 
for man is of more noble complexioun 
þan oþere beestes 
and is sounere igreued 
with coolde 
and with wetheres 
þan oþere bestes. 
And so for to haue nedful mete 
and clooth to þe lyf of mankynde, 
no man suffiseth withoute companye of oþere. Þanne Ʒif it folweth 
þat man hath kynde appetite 
to be companable beest, 
þanne comynte of hous is nedful and oþere comyntees – as comyntees of strete, of cytee, 
and of regne – Ʒif man schal suffice to hemself. 
But Ʒif þes ben nedful to saue 
and kepe þe kynde lif of mankynde, 
it is in som wise kyndelich 
to man to lyue in companye. 
Þe þridde mene to preue þe same is itake 
by puttynge of of greues and lettes to be defended 
fro enemyes and greues. 
For to som bestes for here deffence kynde Ʒeueth hornes as þe bugles and oxene, 
and to som kynde Ʒeueþ teeþ for defence 
as to volues and to houndes, 
and to som powes and clowes 
as to beeres and leons, 
and to som swepernesse and swiftnesse of body 
as to geet and to hares. 
For geet and hares knoweth 
þat þei may not scape oþer wise 
þan by swepernesse 
and swiftnesse and takeþ hem þerfore | 
to flee anon 
as þei huren noyse. 
But to man 
as to most excellent of bestes 
kynde Ʒeueth not for defense hornes and clowes, 
but kynde Ʒeueth hym hondes 
þat ben chief instruments and lymes, as þe philosofer, iii De Anima. 
For with þe hond 
we may make and scape alle instrumentes 
and al þat nedeth for defense. 
Wherfore Ʒif man desireth kyndelich kepyng and sauacioun of his lif, 
and a man þat is solitarie 
and alone suffiseth not to hymself 
to haue mete couenabliche arayed 
and to make armere, 
wepene and instrumentis, 
by þe whiche he may be defended 
fro enemyes and greues, 
it is kyndelich to hym to desire to lyue in comynte 
and to be a companable beest. 
Þe ferþe is itake 
by speche and loore 
by þe whiche we ben itauƷt; 
for oþere beestes ben inclined 
at þe folle by kynde to do workes and dedes 
þat accorden to hem 
withoute lore and teching, 
as an attercoppe wolde spynne and make weft by kynde 
þeiƷ þey hadde neuer iseie attercoppe weue. 
Also swalwes maken here nestes 
at þe beste þeig 
þey seie neuere oþer swalwes make nestes. 
Also þe bychche woot how sche schal do in whelpyng 
by instyncioun of kynde 
þei schue seie neuere oþere bichches whelpy. 
But a womman can not helpe hereself 
in traueile of childe 
but schu be taugt 
atte þe fulle by mydwifes. 
Þanne for man is not inclined 
at þe folle by kynde to do þewe werkes and dedes, 
kynde Ʒeueth speche to mankynde so 
þat by speche men mow teche eche oþer 
and leme of ech oþer. 
And for þat may not be but men lyue and dwelle ifere, 
it is kyndelich to man 
to lyue with oþer 
and to be a companable beest. 
Þerfore þe philosofre, primo Poleticorum, 
among oþere resons 
þat he maketh to | 
preue þat man is a companable beest, 
þey lenyen specialliche on þis resoun: 
þat for speche is to oþere 
as to felawes for kynde Ʒeueth to men speche and resoun 
and not to oþere beestes, 
it folweth þat man 
is more companable 
þan oþere beestes. 
Wherfore Ʒif it is kyndelich to man 
to be so companable, 
þan þey þat forsaken companye 
and wol not lyue 
in companye of oþere men – 
as it is touched 
in þe firste book 
and schal be touched inneremore – suche lyuen not as men. 
Þanne þat is for he failleth of þe manere of mankynde 
and ben þanne 
as it were beestes, 
oþer he passeth the manere of mankynde 
as contemplatif men 
[and] ben þanne as þey it were goddes. 
Þerfore it is iseid, primo Poleticorum, 
þat he þat cheseth solitarie lif to lyue 
by hemself alone 
is no partie of a citee 
but ━is┐ ━as┐ a best oþer a god. 
And þe lettre meneth 
þat þei 
þat wol not lyue with oþer men 
ben to schrewed and froward 
and mowe not abyde 
in felowschipe of oþere men, 
oþer þei ben passyng good 
and wol be occupied 
in contemplacioun and deuocioun 
and ben þanne 
as it were goddes. 
Þanne alle men and namelich kynges and princes scholde besiliche take heede 
how nedeful felowschipe and companye 
is to þe lif of mankynde and to good lif þat þei mowe conne rewle hemself and oþere. Chapter II 
On caas som man wolde meue a doute menyng 
þat we knowe not þe bondes and meres of science, 
for þe companye and comynte 
by þe whiche we suffisen to vsself 
in mete and drynke and clooth 
and in oþer necessaries 
þat nedeþ to þe lif semeth not þe comynte of hous 
but cyuyl comynte; 
for þe philosofer meneth, primo Poleticorum, 
þat comynte of hous suffiseth not | 
in al þat nedeþ to þe lyf. 
And þerfore þe citee was ifounde, 
for thinges þat neden and may not be ifounde 
in non hous noþer in no strete schulde be ifunde 
in anoþer strete oþer in oþer place of þe citee. 
Þanne Ʒif a citee is iordeyned by resoun, 
þerinne scholde be al that nedeth to þe lif 
as it schal be declared 
at þe folle in þe þridde book. 
Wherfore Ʒif it longeth not ‡ 
to þis book 
to trete of comynte of citeseyns 
(for in þis book 
it is itreted of rewlyng of hous, 
but it longeth to þe þridde book 
for þare inne it schal be treted of rewlyng of citees), 
it semeth þat we passen ‡ 
þe bondes and meres of art and of science 
in determenyng in þe nexte chapitre of sum thinges 
þat longeþ to comynte of citee. 
But Ʒif we taken bysiliche heede how comynte of hous 
is ordeyned to oþere comyntees 
– for in eche 
oþer comynte is conteyned comynte of hous, 
for no citee noþer no strete 
may be withoute hous 
– þanne Ʒif comynte is nedful 
to þe lif of mankynde, 
it folweth þat comynte of hous 
is nedful þerto. 
Þanne in þe nexte chapitre we tretede of felauschipe and companye of mankynde declarynge 
þat it is necessarie 
and nedful to oure lif, 
for þerby it is clerliche declared 
þat comynte of hous 
is necessarie and nedful for þerwithoute 
may no comynte stonde. 
Þanne Ʒif we taken heede besiliche 
to speke of polici, 
it schal be knowe 
þat þer is foure manere of comynte 
as comynte of hous, 
of strete, of citee, and of regne. 
For as an hous stondeþ 
in manye persones, 
so in a strete ben many hous; 
so in a citee ben many stretes, 
and in a regne ben many citees. | Wherfore as singuler persones 
ben parties of hous, 
so hous ben parties of a strete 
and stretes 
ben parties of a citee 
and citees ben parties of regnes, 
but not alle in þe same wise. 
But stretes ben þe nexte parties of a strete, 
for a strete is mad of hous 
as of þe nexte parties of citee; 
and house bene the nexte partyes 
of a citee, 
and a citee of stretes, 
and a regne of citees. 
Hous ben parties of þe regne, 
for many hous maken a strete 
and many stretes maken a citee 
and many citees maken a regne. 
Þanne in þis wise comente of hous 
is iordeyned 
to oþere comyntees, 
for eche oþer comynte conteyneth comynte of hous 
and þat comynte 
is in sum wise partee of al oþere comyntees. 
As þe philosofre seith, primo Politicorum, 
þe firste kynde spryngyng 
of a citee was in þis wise: 
first was on hous imaad, 
þanne children encresed and weren so manye 
þat þei myƷth nouƷt dwelle ifere in þat hous. 
Þerfore were oþer hous imaad annexed 
and so of many hous was a strete imaad. 
Þerfore, primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer speketh of a strete 
and seith þat it is icleped vicus and seith þat vicus and vicina domorum 
is al oon 
as it were hous stondyng nyƷ togedres. 
And a strete is icleped of som men collectanei pueri 
and so children ben icleped collectanei pueri 
as it were children of þe same stretes. 
Þanne þe kynde springeth of a strete 
is hous stondynge neiƷ togedres 
þe whiche hous multitude of children 
þat were icleped collectaney made. 
For as it is itouched, 
whanne þe children collectaney and neuews and children 
þat come of oþere children were so | meny þat þey myƷt nouƷt dwelle in oon hous, 
þei moste nedes make mo hous. 
And so þei moste make a strete 
and so come of hem mo children and mo and so most be maad mo stretes 
and so most be maad a toun oþer a citee. 
Afterward were mo townes 
and mo and mo citees and mo and so was imaad a principate and a regne. 
Whether it were poscible 
þat generacioun of strete, 
citees and regneswere in oþer wise 
þan 
by encresynge of children, 
inneremore it schal be declared 
at þe folle; 
but at this tyme it is iseid 
þat suche generacioun 
is most kyndelich for it cometh forþ kyndeliche 
and is þe werke of kynde. 
But how it euere be here of 
and how euere a strete be maad 
oþer a citee oþer a regne, 
alwey þe comynte of hous 
is partie of alle oþere comyntees; 
for withoute hous may noon oþer comynte be. 
For it is iknowe what ordre comynte of hous 
haþ to oþere comyntees, 
it may be sone iknowe how comynte of hous 
is nedful to þe lif of mankynde. 
For Ʒif noon oþer comynte 
may be withoute comynte of hous, 
þanne Ʒif eny comynte is nedful 
to þe lif of mankynde, 
comynte of hous 
is nedful to þe lyf of mankynde. 
Þanne kynges and princes, 
for it is here offis to rewle oþere men 
and to lyue wel, 
thei schulde wete and knowe 
how hows and citees 
beþ nedful to þe lif of mankynde. Chapter III 
That we traueille not in diuers menyng in spekyng of hous, 
it is to wetynge 
þat þis name hous 
may be take for þe boold þat is | imaad of walles and roof and fundament 
and may also be itake for þe maynye þat is þerinne. 
And þis name citee 
is som tyme itake for hous, stretes, and walles 
þat closeth þe citee aboute 
and is som tyme itake for men 
þat ben þerinne. 
For som tyme it is iseid 
þat som citee dude þis oþer 
þat not menyng þat walles, roof, and fundament dede so oþer so, 
but menyng þat men of þe citee 
dede suche dedes. 
So ofte men speken and sayen 
þat here hous dede þat oþer þat, 
not for þe stones dede þat oþer þat 
but for here forfadres dede suche dedes. 
Wherfore as þe comunicacioun of citeseyns 
is icleped a cite, 
so þat companye and comynte of men 
þat wonyen in on hous 
may be cleped an hous. 
Þanne þe hous 
of þe whiche þe principal menynge 
is in moral matier 
is not þe boold 
þat is imaad of fundament, walles, and roof, 
but it is þe comynte of persones of oon hous. 
And it longeth to a morale philosofre 
as it doþ 
to an housebonde 
to trete of buldynge of hous, 
for it longeth to hym generalliche 
and by figures and liknesses 
to declare þat men 
scholde haue honest place 
to wonye inne accordynge 
to richesse and catel þat men hauen. 
But it longeth not to hym 
to trete principalliche of hous 
þat is bulde of walles, stoon, and fundament, 
but he schulde trete of hous 
þat is ibuld 
and hath ordre to þe hous 
þat is comynte of persones, 
[as it longeth to politicum 
to trete of þe ordre of hous, 
and of þe makyng of þe strete 
and of buldynge of þe citee 
as þei ben iordeyned to comynte and policie of citeseyns. 
Þanne we wol schewen of hous 
þat it is comynte of persones] 
of oon hous 
and how suche an hous 
is þe firste comynte. Þan it is to wetynge 
þat þis word first 
may be take in many maner wise; 
for som thing is first in worke, 
and som is first in intencioun and desire, 
| 
and sum is first in þe wey of generacioun and of tyme, 
and sum is first in wey of perfeccioun and complement. 
For we seen þat thinges 
þat ben iordeyned for an ende 
þat is desired cometh tofore 
þat ende in work and in execucioun, 
but þe ende is tofore 
in þe entencioun and desire of hym þat worcheth. 
For þe worchere desireþ first and principaliche a good ende. 
And for he may not come to þe ende 
but by thinges 
þat ben iordeyned for þe ende, 
‡ þe manere of execucioun 
and of work 
is contrarie to þe entencioun and desire. 
For we desiren thinges 
þat ben iordeined for þe ende, 
desiryng þe ende, 
so þat þe ende is first desired. 
But in worching and execucioun is þe contrarie, 
for by work we comen to þe ende 
worchyng and doyng dedes and workes 
þat ben iordeyned for þe ende. 
And þeig suche workes be in þe wille 
[and in þe desire] 
after þe ende, 
Ʒit þei ben worchinge tofore þe ende for Ʒif þe ende were first iwrouƷt and ihad, 
we schul neuere do dedes 
þat ben iordeyned for þe ende; 
for whanne þe ende is ihad þe work ceseth. 
Þanne on manere of distincioun of first is for som thing is first 
in wille and in desire and sum is first in work and in execucioun. 
An noþer maner distinccioun of first [is] 
for som thing is first 
in wey of generacioun and of tyme 
and som thinges first in wey of perfeccioun and of complement, 
as a man is rather a child þan a man and for raþer in tyme a man is igete 
and is raþer a child þan a man. 
But in perfeccioun and complement a man is tofore a child for þe vse of resoun 
þat is nedful to þe perfeccioun of mankynde | 
is more and more parfitliche in a man 
þan in a childe. 
Þanne by þis distinccioun 
of first and raþer 
it may be sone iknowe how þe comynte of hous is iordeyned 
to þe comynte of citee 
and to oþere comyntees. 
For in execucioun 
and in worchinge and dede, 
hous is tofore a strete ‡, a cytee, and regne; 
but in wille and desire oþer comyntees 
ben tofore comynte of hous. 
Also in wey of generacioun 
and of tyme comynte of hous 
is tofore oþer comyntees, 
but in wey of perfeccioun 
and complement oþer comyntees 
ben tofore comyntees of hous. 
And it semeth þat comynte of hous 
may haue double comparisoun 
to oþere comyntees, 
for comynte of hous is lasse parfit þan oþere comyntees 
and alle oþere comyntees 
ben more parfit þan comynte of hous. 
And for alle oþere comyntees 
ben in som wise tofore comynte of hous 
and passen it in som perfeccioun, alle oþere comyntes 
ben more parfit 
þan comynte <of hous>. 
Þanne comynte of hous 
is lasse parfit þanne oþere comyntes 
and is 
as it were partie of oþere comyntees 
þat ben complete and hool. 
Also þis comynte haþ itself 
to oþere comyntees as thinges 
þat ben iordeyned for an ende 
hauen hemself to þat ende. 
For hous is iordeyned to a strete, 
cite and regne as to þe ende. 
For hous is fore a strete, 
strete for a citee, 
a cyte for a regne. 
Þanne comynte of strete 
is þe ende of comynte of hous, 
and comynte of citee is þe ende of comynte of strete, 
and þe comynte of regne is þe ende of alle þe forsaide comyntees. 
Wherfore in þe wey of generacioun 
and of tyme vnparfit 
is tofore parfit and parfit is tofore vnparfit 
in þe wey of perfeccioun and complement, 
it is wel iseid 
þat comynte of hous | is tofore 
oþere comyntees 
in tyme and generacioun 
but oþere comyntees 
beþ tofore comynte of hous 
in perfeccioun and complement. 
Þerfore, primo <Pol>ethicorum, 
þe philosofer makeþ comparisoun 
bytwene a cyte, strete, and hous and seith 
þat þe firste comynte is a citee. 
And þat schal nat be vnderstonde of þe firste 
in wey of generacioun and of tyme, 
for he seith þat a cite comeþ 
and is imaad of multiplicacioun of stretis 
and a strete of multiplicacioun [of] hous. 
Þan [þat] mot be vnderstonde of þe first in wey of perfeccioun and complement. 
Also for comynte of hous 
is not onliche ordeyned 
to oþere comyntees 
as inparfit to parfit 
but also as thing 
þat nedeþ to þe ende 
is iordeyned to þe ende, 
in comparisoun to oþere comyntees 
comynte of hous 
is not onliche rather in tyme and latter in perfeccioun 
and as inparfit in comparisoun to parfit 
but also it is rather in worchinge and latter in desire; 
for thing þat is iordeyned 
to þe ende 
hath suche comparisoun to þat ende. 
And it longeth not onliche to a prince 
and to hym þat Ʒeueth lawe 
and to eche citeseyn to desire 
more principalliche profit of þe citee 
and of þe regne þanne þe profit 
of his owne hous 
as it schal be declared 
at þe folle in þe þridde book. 
For it is iknowe how comynte of hous 
is in som wise tofore oþer comyntees, 
it may be sone iknowe how suche comynte is kyndelich. 
For by cause þat kynde may be withoute craft 
and craft may not be withoute kynde, 
al þat nedeþ to kyndelich thing 
is not properliche a thing of craft; 
but in so moche as it is suche, 
it mot be kyndeliche þyng. 
Wherfore Ʒif a man is kyndeliche companable 
and to eche comynte nedeth comynte of hous, 
comynte of hous moot be kyndelich comynte. 
And kyng|es and princes schulde cunne rewle hous 
and maynye not onliche 
for he scholde be companable and politik for al citeseins schulde kunne rewle hous and mayne, 
but it longeth principaliche to kynges and princes, 
for as regne and cite may not be withoute hous, 
so reulyng of regne and of citee 
may not be withoute cunnynge 
of rewlyng of manye 
and of his proper persone. 
For no man is good rewlere of regne 
oþer in cyte 
but he kunne rewle wel hymself and his maynye. 
Wherfore Ʒif it longeþ specialliche 
to kynges and to princes 
to rewle regnes and cytees, 
it longeþ specialliche to hem to cunne rewle here owne hous and mayne. 
And þanne he schulde knowe whiche is þe comynte of hous – 
for it is in som wise a kyndelich comynte – 
and how suche comynte hath itself to regne and to cite 
as it is declared in þis chapitre, 
for þerby he schal haue greet mene to knowe 
to rewle of citee and of regne. 
But’ it is besiliche to wetyng 
þat þei in a special excellent wyse it longeth to kynges 
and to princes to desire 
þe profit of þe regne, 
gut it longeth to eche citeseyn 
and to eche man of þe citee to desire þe profit of þe regne, 
for þe profit of þe regne (intellectus regni) 
þat is þe profit of alle citeseyns and of alle þat ben in þe regne. 
Þan for eche man scholde studye to be worthi to be kyng 
or to be a prince 
and for alle cyteseyns scholde desire 
þe profit of þe regne, 
eche citeseyn schulde kunne rewle his owne hous 
and maynye not onlich for suche reulyng 
is his owne profit 
but also for suche reulyng 
is iordeyned 
to þe comyn profit 
as to þe profit of regne and of citee. Chapter IV 
In þe nexte chapitre 
it is declared sum del 
what manere comynte is þe comynte of hous, 
for it is declared 
þat man is kyndelich 
an homelich beest and companable 
and þat comynte of hous 
is in som wise kyndelich. 
But nathalees for þerby 
it is not iknowe 
at þe fulle what manere comynte is 
þe comynte of hous, 
þerfore we thenken to speke 
som what of comynte of hous. 
[Þ]anne it is to wityng þat, primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer discreueth comynte of hous 
in þis wise: 
and hous is a comynt[e] iordeyned by kynde in to eche day, 
þat is to menyng for eche dayes nede. 
In þis discripcioun som what is declared in þe nexte chapitre 
tofore 
and som is to declaryng herafter. 
For it is preued tofore boystousliche 
and by liknesse 
þat in an hous 
is a comynte iordeyned by kynde, 
and schal be more clerliche declared herafter, 
þere alle þe parties of an hous 
schal be distyngwed 
and it schal be preued 
þat eche part of an hous 
is som kyndelich thing. 
Þanne it is to declaryng 
in þe forsaide descripcioun how þe comynte of hous 
is ordeyned in to eche day. 
And for þe euydence herof 
it is to wetynge 
as þe philosofer distingeth, primo Poleticorum, 
þat som workes of mankynde 
and som thinges 
þat ben iordeyned 
and ben nedfol to suffisaunt lif of mankynde – for þe whiche comynte of mankynde is iordeyned 
– summe ben nedful eche day 
as thulke þat vs nedeth eche day 
as ete and drynke and oþer sustenance 
and bodilich seruyse and oþer þat vs nedeþ eche day. 
And som is not nedful ech day 
as byggynge an[d] sellynge; 
for Ʒif men ben in an hous 
and nedeþ ech day to bygge and to selle 
for sustenans of þe lif, 
it semeth þat þat cometh of | defaute and lacke and of corupcioun of þe hous. 
For it semeth 
þat þei doun notas men 
þat ben at home noþer as citeseins 
butas pilgrimes and weyfaryng men Ʒif [hem nedeþ] 
eche day to bygge and to selle for sustenaunce of þe lif. 
Þanne comynte of hous is imaad for thinges 
þat vs nedeth alwey. 
And for not al thinges 
þat nedeþ 
to þe lif of mankynde ben | ifounde in oon hous, 
comynte of hous suffiseth not but comynte of strete is nedful; 
so þat in oo strete ben many hous 
and what is not ifounde in oon hous is founde in an nother. 
Þerfore þe philosofer, primo Poleticorum, 
seith þat as comynte of hous 
is ordeyned for thinges 
þat nedeþ eche day, 
[so] commynte of strete 
is ordeyned for þynges 
þat nedeþ [‡ not eche day]. 
And not al þyng þat nedeþ 
to þe lif of mankynde 
is ifounde in on strete; 
þerfore passyng þe comynte of strete, 
it nedeþ to haue comynte of citee. 
It semeth þat comynte of cite 
is ordeyned for to haue þerinne al þat nedeth to þe lif of mankynde. 
Þanne [it semeth] 
þat þe cite is p[ar]fit 
as it is iseid tofore in þe whiche al thing may be founde 
þat nedeth to þe lyf of mankynde. 
Also for citees hauen som tyme werre aƷenst enemyes 
to putte of enemyes and greues, 
it is good þat oo citee be confedered with anoþer. 
For confederacioun of citees is good and profitable 
to withstonde enemyes and greues 
þat destroyeth, 
al withoute comynte of hous of stretes 
and of citees [was] 
ifounde comynte of regne and of principate 
in þe whiche comynte is confideracioun of manye castelles and townes and citees 
vnder oon prince 
oþer oo kyng. 
Þanne þis schal be þe ordre: 
þat an hous is a comynte iordeyned 
by kynde for thinges 
þat nedeþ eche day; 
and a strete is a | comynte iordeyned for thinges 
þat nedeth not eche day; 
and a cyte is a comynte iordeyned 
for suffisans 
of al þat nedeþ 
to þe lif of mankynde; 
but a regne is iordeyned 
not oonliche to reule 
þe nede of þe lif of mankynde 
but also to putte of and withstonde wronges and greuus. 
And on cite sufficeþ 
not at þe ful to put of soche wronges and greues 
but Ʒif many citees, 
castel[les] and townes holden togedres. 
Þan it is declared what maner [is] comynte of houses, 
for it is a kyndely comynte iordeyned for þynges 
þat nedeþ eche day. 
And þat in an hous mot be manye persones 
it is nouƷt hard to knowe. 
For as it is declared tofore 
þat an hous 
is a certein comynte and companye of persones, 
and for proprelich for to speke man 
hath not comynte noþer companye to hymself, 
Ʒif we wolle haue 
and saue comynte in an hous, 
þerinne mot be manye persones. 
And as it schal be declared inneremore 
and as þe philosofer meneth, primo Poleticorum, 
not oonliche an hous is a certein comynte 
but in an hous mot be many comyntees 
and þat may not be withoute manye persones. 
Þanne it is declared in an hous ben manye persones 
and what maner comyntee an hous is 
and how it is necessarie and nedfol, 
for it is declared 
þat not onliche comynte of hous is spedful 
but also comyntees of stretes of cite and of regne. 
And whether for oþere causes 
þat ben now rehersed comynte of cite 
and of regne is spedful, 
it schal be declared 
at þe folle 
in þe þridde book. 
Be it inow at þis tyme to touche of citee 
and of regne in so moche as knewlech þerof helpeth in som wise 
to knowe an hous 
and to wete and to knowe howe it scholde be reuled. 
Fore as it is iseid tofore, 
in þe seconde book 
þe principal entent 
is þe reulyng of an hous | 
and not þe reulyng of a cite. 
Þanne for þes ben itreted in þis wise, 
for comynte of hous 
is so necessarie and nedful in cyuel lif, 
eche citesein schulde cunne reule his owne hous in þew manere. 
And þe more preiudice may come to cite and to regne of mysrewlynge of hous of kynges and of princes passynge mysrewlynge of oþere menne hous, 
þe more kynges and princes schulde cunne rewle wel here owne hous. Chapter V Primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer meneth 
þat in an hous 
ben twey comyntees – comyntees 
of housebonde and of wif, 
of lord and of seruant in þe firste hous. 
And seith þat in þe firste hous 
ben þes tweyn comyntees; 
for namelich þese twey comyntees 
mot be in an hous, 
for suche comynte mot be in an hous 
withoute þe whiche an hous may not wel stonde. 
And þat þe hous 
þe whiche we speken of heere 
may not wel ‡ stonde 
withoute housbonde and wife, lord and seruant, 
may be declared in þis wise: 
fore as it is iseid 
tofore and schal be declared 
at þe folle in þe processe, 
an hous is som what kyndelich. 
And it semeth þat generacioun of thinges 
and kepynge and sauynge 
þerof semeth most kyndelich. 
And as, ii Phisicorum, 
it is iseid 
þat generacioun 
is þe wey in to kynde 
and for a kyndelich thing 
fongeth his owne kynde by generacioun, 
it is wel iseid þat þe philosofer seith þat generacioun 
is som what kyndelich and work of kynde. 
Also kepyng and sauynge of þynges is kyndelich, 
for an idel a thing were gendred kyndelich 
but it myƷt be kept and isaued. 
Þanne thes twey workes of kynde, 
generacioun of thinges 
and sauynge of hem, 
schal not be departed. 
For sauacioun schal not be departed 
fro generacioun, 
for sauacioun may | not be wiþoute generacioun. 
For thing þat is gendred 
may not be saued in beyng 
but it haue being tofore by generacioun, 
sauynge of thinges 
þat ben igendred 
may not be but Ʒif generacioun come tofore. 
And so generacioun schal not be departed 
fro sauacioun, 
for as it is iseid 
an ydel were igendred 
yif it myƷte in none wise 
be ikept and isaued in beryng. 
Þanne in þis wise þees comyntees maken 
an hous be sum what kyndeliche, 
for þe comynte of housbonde 
and of wif is ordeyned to generacioun, 
and to þe comynte of lord 
and of seruant 
to kepyng and sauacioun. 
Wherfore Ʒif generacioun and sau[a]cioun 
is som what kyndelich, 
an‡ hous mote be som what kyndelich. 
Also for generacioun and sauacioun schal not be departed, 
it semeth þat þes twey comyntees maken þe firste hous 
for þerwithoute 
may not an hous wel stonde. 
And þat þe comynte of housebonde 
and of wyf is iordeyned for generacioun 
it is not hard to knowe, 
for by cause of children principaly company of mal 
and feimel is ordeined. 
But þat comynte of lord and seruant 
is iordeyned 
for kepyng and sauacioun 
it is not to clerlyche iknowe. 
Þanne it is to wetyng 
þat Ʒif oon is þewlich a lord 
and anoþer serueth 
as he scholde, 
þe lord is isaued 
by þe seruant 
and þe seruant by þe lord so þat þe same is spedfu[l] to þe lord 
and to þe seruant. 
For it is spedful to þe seruant 
to serue þe lord 
and it is spedful to þe lord 
to be serued of þe seruant. 
For as þe philosofre meneth, primo Polethicorum, 
he is a lord 
þat hath good wit and vnderstondyng, 
and proprelich for to speke 
he is a seruant 
þat failleth witt 
and hath grete bodilich strengþe. 
Þanne for a seruant 
can not rewle hymself, 
it is spedful | to hym to be soget and serue hym 
þat is prudens and wise 
to be saued and irewled by hym. 
For he þat lacketh wit and vnderstondyng 
is as þei it were blynd and woot not how he schal goo and wende. 
Þanne þat is suche oon, 
þe more bodilich strengthe he haþ 
þe more hym nedeth 
to be rewled 
for his owne sauacioun. 
And as he þat is bodilich blynd 
whan he goth, 
bot he be lad, 
he stomblethand boscheth ofte and soone, 
and þe more strongliche he gooth 
þe more hym nedeth ledyng ‡ 
for so he may busche and stomly þe hardere. 
So for a seruant is kyndelich bodilich stronge 
and lacketh wit and kunnyng, 
Ʒif he schal be saued, 
it is spedful to hym to serue sum wiƷe man and redy. 
Þanne it is spedful to a seruant serue a lord; 
so it is spedful to a lord 
to be serued of a seruant, 
for by kynde lordes ben wise and redy. 
Þanne for þei 
þat ben wise and redy and witty 
hauen comynliche tendre flesch and skyn and failleth 
in bodiliche strengþe 
as þe philosofer meneth, 
ii De Anima, 
and seith þat þey 
þat ben tendre of flesch 
and of skyn ben wise and witty, 
þanne it is spedful to men 
þat ben so desposed to be serued of oþere men. 
For by cause of defaute of bodiliche strengþe thei suffisen not to hymself in doynge 
þat is nedful to doyng of þe lyf. 
Wherfore Ʒif a lord is saued by a seruant 
[and a seruant] by þe lord, 
it is wel iseid tofore 
þat to þe makynge of an hous 
nedeth comynte of lord 
and seruant for sauacioun and kepynge. 
Þanne thes twey comyntes of þe whiche oon serueth to generacioun 
and þe oþer to sauacioun maketh þe firste hous, 
for þerwithoute propreliche to speke may noon | hous stonde. 
An[d] wheer comynte of lord 
oþer of seruant be oþer wyse iordeyned ‡ for sauacioun and kepyng þanne for a lord 
is saued by a seruant 
and a seruant by a lord, 
inneremore it schal be clerliche declared. 
For it is iknowe how þes twey comyntees ben nedful to þe comyntee of an hous 
(for, 
as þe philosofer seith, 
of þes tweyne þe firste hous is imaad), 
it may be sone iknowe how to þe makyng nameliche 
of suche an hous neden þre manere persones. 
And on caas som man wolde wene þat, 
for þe firste hous is maad of tweye comyntees 
and eche comynte nedeþ twey persones, 
þat þe firste hous 
þat is maad of twey comyntees neden foure manere persones, 
so þat þe firste [per]sone 
is þe housebonde, 
þe seconde þe wif, 
þe þridde þe lord, 
þe ferþe þe seruant. 
But þe housebond and þe lord 
ben not diuerse bot al oo persone, 
for he þat is housebonde of þe wif is lord of þe seruant 
oþer of þe seruantes 
Ʒif þer ben manye seruantes in þe hous. 
Þanne þre manere persones 
oþer som whaat in here 
stede makeþ þe firste hous. 
And we sayen sum what in here stede for not alwey a seruant is in þe makyng of an hous 
but alwey a seruant is in þe makyng of an hous oþer som what in stede of a seruant 
as þe philosofer wol mene, primo Poleticorum. 
For he seith þat a pore man 
þat may not haue a seruant man oþer womman 
hath a oxe oþer anoþer beste for seruant 
þat is noþer man noþer womman. 
And sum man is so pore 
þat not oonliche he may not haue a seruant man noþer womman 
but also he may not haue a souled seruant 
but hath in his stede sum whaat þat is soules. 
| And som man is so pore 
þat he may not haue oxe noþer hors 
as souled seruantes 
to erye lond 
and to do oþere workes, 
and hauen in stede of oxe oþer of hors a mattok 
oþer sum oþer instrument oþer tool. 
So þat þe swithe poore man 
haþ a mattok 
in stede of instrument 
oþer of seruant 
to telye his lond 
Ʒif he is so pore 
þat he may not haue noon oxe noþer hors. 
Þanne þe firste hous is imaad 
of þre persones of housebond, 
wif and seruant oþer of sum 
what elles in stede of seruant. 
Þerfore, primo Polethicorum, 
þe philosofer preiseth oon Esyodus 
þat seide 
þat an hous is maad of þre: 
of man, womman, and oxe þat erien lond. 
And þere he setteth þe oxe 
in stede of seruant, 
for as þe philosofre meneth þere a swythe pore man 
hath an oxe 
in stede of seruant 
oþer som what elles in stede of an oxe. 
And citeseins schulde knowe 
al þe partyes 
of þe whiche an hous is imaad, 
for Ʒif þe parties of þe hous ben vnknowe, 
þe rewlyng þerof is vnknowe. 
And it is most semelich 
þat kynges and princes knowe þe parties of an hous; 
for knowyng of þe parties of an hous 
and knowyng how many manere persones 
and how manye comyntees neden to an hous 
as þe philosofer seiþ, primo Polethicorum, 
helpeth not onlich 
to þe rewlyng of an hous 
but also to þe rewlyng 
of a cyte and of a regne, 
for þe parties of an hous ben parties of a cytee and of a regne. Chapter VI 
It is iseid in þe nexte chapitre 
tofore þat twey comyntees – þat ben þe comyntees of housbonde and wif, 
of lord and of seruant – makeþ þe firste hous. 
But Ʒif þe hous schal be parfit, 
þer nedeþ þe þridde comynte of fader and sone. 
For we seeth in kyndelich thinges 
þat anoon as þynges ben igendred, 
kynde is besy to saue hem | 
so þat generacioun and sauacioun 
ben þe firste workes of kynde. 
Þanne it is wel iseid 
þat comynte of housbonde and wif 
þat is ordeyned for generacioun 
and of lord and seruant 
þat is iordeyned for sauacioun makeþ þe firste hows. 
Þanne in þis wise sauacioun haþ comparisoun to þyng 
þat is gendred, 
for anoun as þyng is gendred, 
kynde is besi to saue it 
þat it may be parfit 
and gendre thing ileche þerto. 
But gendryng thing 
þat is liche þerto 
is not so 
in comparisoun to kyndeliche thinges; 
for whanne kyndeliche thing is igendred, 
it may not anoon gendre 
and bryng forth such another 
but it mot abyde forto it be parfite. 
And anon as a childe is ibore kynde is besy to saue hym; 
but þe childe may not anoon gendre 
and brynge forth suche anoþer 
but he mot abyde forto he be parfit. Þanne gendrynge and brynglyng] 
forþ suche another longeth 
not to kyndelich thing 
in al maner wise 
but whanne it is complet and parfit. 
Þanne Ʒif an hous 
is som what kyndeliche 
and we wolle reducte thinges 
þat we seen in to kyndelich causes we schal seye 
þat twey comyntees 
– of housbonde and wif, 
of lord and seruant – makeþ 
þe firste hous 
for þerwithoute 
may not an hous wel stonde. 
But we schal not seie 
þat þe þridde comynte, 
þat is of fader and sone, 
is of comynte of hous 
in al maner wise 
but Ʒif þe hous is parfit. 
For as we seen in oon singuler persone, 
‡ so we schal take hede of al þe hole hous. 
For alwey multitude cometh of oon, 
þerfore in kynde ordre 
what we seen in multitude of oon hous 
is ikept and isaued in oon singuler persone; 
and so we seen in oon synguler man 
þat lif and sauacioun ben 
of þe lif 
and resoun of þe firste man, 
but | gendre and brynge forth suche anoþer 
is of þe resoun of a parfit man. 
For whan a man is first, 
he mot be gendred 
and anon kynde is besy for his sauacioun; 
but he may not anoon gendre and brynge forþ suche anoþer 
or he be parfit. 
Wherfore comynte of fader and sone cometh of fader and moder gendreth and bryngeth forþ 
oon ileche to ham in kynde, 
and suche a comynte is not 
of þe resoun of þe first hous 
but it is of þe resoun 
of a parfit hous. 
Þerfore, primo Polethicorum, 
whan þe philosofre hadde iseid 
þat comynte of housbonde and wif, 
of lord and seruant, 
maken þe firste hous, 
afterward in þe nexte chapitre 
of þe same book 
he seid þat to a parfit hous nedeþ þe þridde comynte þat is of fader and sone. 
And þat to a parfit hous 
nedeþ þis þridde comynte it 
may be preued in þre manere wise, 
for we seen þat thinges 
þat mow not brynge forþ 
fruyt and worche ben lasse parfit þanne thinges 
þat mowe. 
Also as it is opunliche iknowe 
þat euer lastyng thinges 
ben more parfit þan thinges 
þat ben not euere lastynge. 
And so þei þat ben in felicitee 
ben more parfit þan þey þat ben not in felicite and welthe. 
Þanne þat to a parfit hous 
nedeþ þis þridde comynte þat is of fader and sone, 
first we may preue by generacioun 
and by natural fructificacioun, 
þe seconde by euerlastyngenesse, 
þe þridde by felicite. 
Þe first is declared in þis wise for, 
as þe philosofer meneþ, 
þan eche þyng is parfit 
whanne it may gendre 
and brynge forþ such anoþer; 
for þeiƷ a þyng be parfit it nedeþ not þat it gendre 
and bryng forþ such anoþer 
but it nedeþ 
þat it haue myƷt to gendre 
and to bryng forþ with anoþer. 
For perfeccioun is iknowe by kynde and forme of a þyng 
by þe which it is in acte and in dede and haþ myƷt for to worche. 
Wherfore Ʒif a þyng haþ 
no myƷt for to werche, 
it folweþ þat | it failleth and lacketh 
som forme and som perfeccioun 
þat is welle of werching. 
And a thing is vnmyƷty to worching 
whan it haþ present thing 
þat is able to fonge worchinge 
and it gendreth not noþer 
bryngeth forþ suche anoþer. 
Wherfore for þe propre worchere 
in generacioun is þe maal 
and þe propre fongere is þe femel, 
Ʒif an hous is coniunccioun of maal and femel 
and no child igete, 
þe mal is vnparfit worchere 
oþer þe femel is vnparfit fongere. 
Þanne bareynesse of children 
in politik lif cometh of inperfeccioun of þe male oþer of þe femel 
eþer of eiþer. 
But Ʒif male and femel, housbonde and wif, 
is þe firste part of an hous 
and þe firste comynte, 
it nedeþ in þe lif of an hous 
þat is of inperfeccioun of suche maal 
and femel and ben most principal 
þat al þe hous be vnparfit 
for al þe hous is vnparfit Ʒif þerinne is no childryng. 
Þe secounde for to preue þe same 
is itake by kyndeliche euerlastyngnesse. 
For men mow not euer laste in hemself and be perpetual in þis lif, 
but in sum wise þe lif of mankynde 
is perpetual by successioun of children; 
an hous withoute children 
by kynde ordre schal sone be destroyed and desolate. 
For contynual wonyng in hous in oon manere wise 
is kyndelich 
as Ʒif hous 
is contynualliche iocupied 
by successioun of children. 
And is [in] a casual man[er] oþer wise, 
as Ʒif þei þat wonen þerinne dyeth oþer gooþ 
in to anoþer place 
and newe men 
and manye comeþ 
and wonyeth in þat hous. 
Þanne kynde habitacioun in hous 
may not be perpetual 
but by generacioun of children 
þat is work of kynde to brynge forth manye children. 
But Ʒif thing þat is 
perpe|tual is more parfit 
þan thing þat is not perpetual, 
an hous withoute children is vnparfit. 
For by children habitacioun in hous 
is in som manere wise kyndelich perpetual. 
Þe þridde, 
þe same may be declared 
by felicite and welthe. 
For children and cyuel power 
and myƷt and oþere suche, 
þey he be not essencial 
to felicitee and welþe, 
Ʒit he makeþ som clemesse of felicite, 
ioy and welþe. 
Þerfore, primo Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat som defautes 
and lackes defouleþ ioye and welþe, 
for he þat is foule, 
vnworthy and solitarye 
and withoute children 
may not be felix. 
For in al wise suche 
on is not felix 
for he hath not politik felicite 
with al þe clernesse þerof. 
And so it is declared 
þat Ʒif an hous schal be parfit 
þerinne mote be þre comyntees: 
oon of housbonde and wif; 
anoþer of lord and seruant; 
and þe þridde of fader and sone. 
Herby it may be knowe þat 
in a parfit hous 
moot be þre manere of rewlyng 
for no comynte 
is wel iordeyned 
but þerinne be sum 
whaat þat reuleth and sum what þat is irewled and sum what þat is cheef and souereyn 
and som soget and obedient. 
Wherfore by cause þat 
in comynte of male and femel þe housebonde schulde be loord and maister 
and þe femel obedient, 
in comynte of fader and sone þe fader scholde comande and hoote 
and þe sone scholde be obedient and boxom. 
And in comynte of lord and seruant þe lord 
scholde be cheef prince 
and maystere 
and þe seruant suget and seruynge. 
As þe philosofer meneþ, primo Poleticorum, 
in a parfit hous 
is þre manere reulyng: 
oon coniugale, wedlok, 
in þe whiche þe housbonde 
is aboue þe wife; 
anoþer patemale in þe wiche þe fader is aboue þe children; 
þe þridde, dominatiuum, lordschipe, 
in þe whiche þe lord is aboue þe seruantes. 
| It is iknowe þat in a parfit hous 
ben þre comyntees 
and þre manere of reulyng 
and it may be sone iknowe þat þer mote be foure manere of persones. 
[But on caas som man wolde wene þat of suche an hous scholde be sexe manere of 
persones,] 
so þat housbonde 
by þe firste persone 
and þe wif þe seconde, 
[þe fader þe þridde, 
þe sone þe ferþe, þe lord þe fifþe, 
þe semant þe sexte]. 
And housebonde, lord and fader is al oon persone, 
for he þat is housebonde of þe wif is fader of children and lord of semantes. 
Þanne it is ik[n]owe how many comyntees 
ben in a parfit hous 
and how manye manere of rewelyng 
and how many manere of persones. 
Þanne it may be sone iknowe how many parties 
þis seconde book hath in þe whiche it is treted of rewlyng of hous. 
For in an hous is þre manere of rewlyng, 
þis book mot haue þre parties: 
in þe firste parti it is itreted 
how þe housebond schal rewle his wif; 
in þe seconde, 
how þe fader schal rewle his children; 
and in þe þridde, 
how a lord schal rewle his seruantƷ and manye. 
Þanne it is most semelich 
þat kynges and princes knowe þis þre manere of rewlyng, 
for Ʒif þei taken besilich hede 
þerto þei hauen a greet helpe 
to kunne wel rewle regne and citee. Chapter VII 
It is seid 
in þe nexte chapitre tofore 
þat þre schal be determyned 
in þe seconde book, 
in þe whiche it is itreted of hous in þe whiche is þre manere of reulyng: 
oon is coniugale, 
þerby þe housebonde rewleth þe wif; 
þe oþer is paternale, 
þerby þe fader reuleth his children; 
and þe þridde domynatiuum, 
þerby a lord rewleþ his seruantes and maynye. 
Among þes maneres of reulyng first 
it is to tretynge of þe manerereulynge 
þat hatte coniugale, wedlok, 
and þerby þe housbonde rewleth his wif. 
For, primo Polethicorum, 
þe philosofer meneþ 
þat in comynte of hous firste þe maal 
and þe femal mote come togeders, 
and þis | is a resonable ordre. 
For first, 
a þyng is igendred; 
þe seconde, 
it is isaued; 
þe þridde, 
it is imaad parfit 
and may gendre 
and brynge forþ 
suche ío anoþer. 
Þanne þe comynte of maal and of femal 
þat is iordeyned for generacioun 
is þe firste partie of an hous 
and is tofore 
þe comynte of lord and seruant 
þat is iordeyned for sauacioun and kepyng, 
and also tofore comynte of fader and sone 
þat longeth not to þe first hous noþer 
to al maner hous 
but to a parfit hous. 
Þanne firste, 
it is to spekynge of rewlyng coniugale 
þat longeth to housebonde and wyf and tofore rewlyng dominatif, lordschipe, 
þat longeth to comynte of lord and seruant 
and also tofore rewlyng paternale 
þat longeth to comynte of fader and sone. 
And in tretyng of rewlyng coniugale 
þis ordre þow schalt holde: 
and first þow schalt saye 
what maner thing is coniugium, 
wedlok and mariage, 
and what maner wifes citeseins 
and namliche kynges 
and princes schulde haue and take. 
Þanne we schal declare how þei scholde rewle þeire wifes, 
and to what vertues and workes 
þei scholde ordeyne here wifes. 
And in declaryng what maner thing is coniugium, 
wedlok and mariage, 
first it is to declaryng þat coniugium, wedlock and mariage, 
is som thing by kynde and for man 
is kyndeliche disposed to mariage and wedlok. 
Þanne it is to wetyng, 
as þe philosofer meneth, 
[fliii Ethicorum, 
declaryng what manere frendschipe and loue 
is bytwene housbonde and wif, 
he preueth þat þat frendschipe and loue 
is by kynde and maken þre resouns and preueth þat man is animal coniugale naturaliter, 
kyndelich is desposed to wedlok and mariage. 
Þe firste resoun is itake 
by felowschipe and companye | of mankynde; 
þe seconde, 
[by gendryng of children; 
þe þridde, 
by workes and dedes]. 
In þe firste chapitre of þis seconde book it is declared þat man is by kynde a companable beest and comunicatif; 
and as it is iseid tofore, 
in þe lif of mankynde comynte is deled in foure manere comyntees. 
For som is comynte of hous, 
and som of strete, 
and som of citee, 
and som of regne; 
and noon of þes comyntees 
may stonde withoute comyntees of hous. 
Þanne for hous 
is tofore strete and citee and regne, 
man is raþer kyndelich a beest of hous 
þan of cyte. 
And comynte of hous semeth more kyndelich to man þan comynte of cite oþer of regne. For Ʒif we taken hede to thinges 
to þe whiche comynte of hous is iordeyned, 
it semeth no doute 
þat comynte of hous 
is more kyndelich to man 
þan comynte of strete, of cite, oþer of regne. 
For comynte of hous is ordeyned to fedyng and norsching 
þat is most nedefol among tweyne 
and most spedful to propre profit, 
and is also iordeyned for generacioun 
þat is most spedful for sauyng of special kynde, 
and for þe comyn profit. 
And strete, cite and regne ben not iordeyned 
so nyƷe for norschynge and propre profit and generacioun. 
But of goodnesse of strete, cyte and regne cometh goodnesse to þe hous, 
for an hous is þe bettre Ʒif it stondeþ 
in a good strete, 
citee oþer regne. 
Þanne 
3¿f man is more kyndelich animal domesticum, 
a beest of hous, 
þanne animal politicum, 
a beest of citee, 
for þe firste comynte of hous 
is comynte of housbonde and wif, 
þanne by comunicacioun of mankynde it folweth þat man is more kyndeliche animal 
coniugale þan politicum. 
Þat is to menyng þat man is more kyndelich disposed to wedlok and mariage 
þan to wonye in a cite, 
and þat he is more comunycatif in comyn|te of wedlok þanne in comynte of strete, cyte and regne. 
For þe firste rewlyng of hous 
is þe rewlyng of wedlok, coniugale, and hous is tofore strete, cite and regne. 
And þe philosofre toucheth þis resoun, 8 Ethicorum, 
for man is by kynde more desposed to wedlok 
þan to dwel in cite. 
Þe seconde, man is kyndelich disposed to wedlok 
by cause of gendryng of children. 
For þyng to þe which man haþ kynde apetite 
is most kyndelich to man; 
wherfore bi cause þat kyndelich man 
and alle beestes ben inclyned 
and hauen wille to gendre and to brynge forþ brood of here owne kynde, 
for among alle beestes man is most [þ]ewliche iset in wedlok, 
man is kyndeliche disposed to wedlok. 
Primo Polethicorum and [v]iii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer toucheth þis resoun and preueþ 
þat wedlok is kyndelich to man, 
for it is kyndelich to man 
and to al bestes to haue kynde 
appetite to gendre 
and to brynge forth brood 
of here owne kynde. 
Þe þridde resoun 
is itake by workes and dedes. 
For as it is iseid, 
viii Ethicorum, workes of housebonde and wif ben departed, 
for workes of housebonde stondeþ 
in doynge withoute þe hous and workes of þe wif in kepyng and sauynge thinges 
þat ben in hous 
and in arayenge and hiƷtynge of þe hous. 
Þanne doyng þe propre workes 
to þe comynte 
as whan þe wif ordeyneth here owne werkes 
to profit of þe housebonde 
and of al þe hous 
and þe housebonde ordeyneth his owne werkes 
to profit of þe hous 
and of þe wif, 
þanne þei ben suffisaunt to hemself 
in þis lif 
as it is iseid, 
viii Ethicorum. 
For suche ordeynyng of propre workes 
to profit of [þe comynte] makeþ 
a manere suffisaunce of lif. 
Wherfore Ʒif it is kyndeliche to man to haue appetite and desire to suffisauns lif, 
it is kyndelich to hym to desire 
and wilne to be desposed to wedlok. 
But Ʒif wedlok is kyndelich, 
it folweth þat fomica|cioun þat is contrarie to wedlok schuld be forsake of al citeseyns 
as þyng þat is contrarie to wedlok 
þa[t] is kyndelich. 
And þe more semelich 
it is þat kynges and princes passe 
oþer men in godenes, 
þe more þei scholde forsake fornicacioun 
and al vnlaweful vse of lecherie. 
For þis is iseie 
and iknowe þat it seme 
þat som doute springeþ heerof; 
for Ʒif wedlok is kyndelich to man, 
þanne eche man 
þat forsaketh wedlok and workes 
þerof is to blame. 
But Ʒif thinges þat ben iseid ben iknowe at þe folle, 
þe forseide doute 
may be sone asoyled. 
For Ʒif it is kyndeliche to man 
to be disposed to wedlok, 
no man þat forsaketh 
wyuyng lyueth as a man. 
But [not] lyueth as a man 
may be in twey manere wise: 
for [oþer] thei chesen a lyf 
þat is aboue a man 
and wol leue in contemplacioun, 
oþer he cheseth a lif 
þat is bynethe a man 
and lyueth as a best. Wherfore as it is iseid of companye politik 
þat he þat cheseth wildemesse 
and wol not lyue in polecye and companye, 
oþer he is a beest 
oþer a god. 
And so we may saye of wedlok; 
for he þat wol not lyue in wedlok 
þat is for he wol þe more freschliche lyue 
in fornicacioun and chesen þerfore a lif 
þat is bynethe a man 
and is as þey were a beest, 
other for he wol lyue in contemplacioun 
and in Goddis semyse 
and cheseth þerfore a lyf þat is aboue a man 
and is as it were a god. Þanne þei þat weuen not, 
Ʒif þei geuen hemself to dedes 
þat ben bettre þan dedes of wedlok, 
━þeiƷ┐ ━þei┐ lyue not as men, 
Ʒut þerfore he doþ not euele for þei ben 
as it were goddes 
and bettre þan men. Chapter VIII Philosofres preuen 
þat wedlok scholdenotbe departed. 
And topreue þat we may brynge twey resons 
þat philosofers | touchen. 
Pe firste reson is itake by feith and trouthe oþer 
by kynde frendschipe and loue 
þat scholde be bytwene housbonde and wif, 
and þe seconde reson 
is itake by getyng of children. Þe firste reson is declared in þis wise, 
for no man is trewe frend to anoþer 
Ʒif he forsaketh his frenschipe. 
Ʒif we wolle bytwene housebonde 
and wif saue trewe feith and frendschipe so 
þat trewe fey be not defouled, 
þe housebonde mot holde hym 
onlich 
to his wif and aƷenward. 
For bytwene housbonde and wif is kynde frendschipe 
as it is ipreued, 
viii Ethicomm, 
and kynde frendschipe 
is not betweyne persones 
but þey holde trewe fey ech to oþer. 
Ʒif wedlok is by kynde, 
and Ʒif betwene housbonde 
and wif is kynde frendschipe, 
þei mot holde trew feyth to oþere so 
þat noþer of hem scholde partye fro oþer. 
And it semeth þat þe philosofer 
toucheth þis resoun 
in Magnis Moralibus, 
capitulo Valerius Maximus, 
libro ii De Factis, Institutis Antiquis, 
þere he seith þat in þe tyme 
in þe whiche þe citee of Rome 
was ibuld an hundred Ʒere and foure and fifty was no deuorse imaad 
bytweyne housbond and wif. 
And þe firste þat lefte his wif 
for sche was bareyne was oon Epims Cardibulus. 
And þeiƷ he semede skilfulliche imeued, 
Ʒut he was not al blamelees, 
for ‡ he trowede 
þat desire of children scholde be sette tofore trewe fey and wedlok. 
Þanne as Valerius Maximus seith, 
‡ trewe feye 
þat housebonde and wif scholde holde eiþer to oþer scholde 
be holde withoute departyng and deuorse. 
Þanne it is semelich 
þat alle housebondes 
hoolde hym 
to here owne wifes withoute | departyng and withoute deuorse. 
And þe more fey and trouthe 
and oþer goodnesse scholde be in kynges 
and princes passynge oþere men, 
þe more semelich it is 
þat þei holde hem treuliche 
to here owne wyues withoute departyng and withoute deuorse. 
Þe seconde mene for to preue 
þe same is itake by children. For þeig wedlok be bareyne, 
it schal stonde and not be departed, 
for coueitise of children schal not be sette tofore trouthe and fey of wedlok. 
But Ʒif þer ben children, 
for children ben a maner comune good and profit 
in þe whiche housebonde 
and wif ben ibounde, 
by cause of children it is semelich 
þat housebonde 
and wif abide togedres 
withoute departyng. 
For we seen alwey þat good 
þat is comyn iuneth togeders 
þe partyners of þat good. 
Þanne [as] a citee iuneþ togedres al þe citeseins 
þat þei goo awey not 
fro þe citee 
for it is here owne good, 
so it is [þat children iuneth togedres] fader and moder 
þat þey gon not on fro oþer 
for þei ben here owne good. 
For alwey it is resoun of þing ‡ 
þat is comyn to iune and to abide, 
as it is þe reson of þyng 
þat is propre to dele, 
distyngue and departe. 
And þe philosofer toucheth þis reson, 
viii Ethicorum, 
and seith þat for thing 
þat is comyn knytteth and iuneth, 
for children is comyne good 
of fader and moder, 
it semeth þat children 
is cause of here iunyng and knyttyng. 
And seith also þat þe bareyne ben sone departed. 
And it is iseid 
þat þe bareyn ben sone departed 
not for departyng of wedlok is laweful 
þei þer be no children 
as it is declared 
at þe fulle by þe raþer reson. 
Nathales Ʒif in wedlok ben children, 
| not oonlich for þe feith and trewthe 
þat scholde be holde in wedlok housbonde 
and wif scholde abide 
eiþer with oþer withoute departyng, 
but also þei hauen desire 
and wille to abide togeders 
by cause of þe children 
þat is here comyne good. 
For Ʒif som men ben frendes to oon, 
by cause of þat oon þei desiren to be frendes eche to oþer. 
Þanne fader and moder 
þat louen kyndelich here owne child, 
for kynde loue 
þat þey haue to þat child, 
here owne kynde frendschipe and loue is more. 
But eche loue hath a vertue of acord and onynge; 
and þanne for þe loue 
is þe more 
by cause of þe child, 
here owne loue is þe more and desireþ þe more to dwelle togedres 
withoute departyng. 
Þanne it is declared 
þat alle citeseins schulde not onliche for þe good of trouthe and feiþ of wedlok dwelle togedres 
with here wifes withoute departyng 
but also by cause of children 
to þe whiche wedlok is iordeyned. 
And þe more cure and besynesse kynges and princes schulde haue of here children 
passynge oþere men, 
þe more semelich it is 
þat þei abyde with here wifes withoute departyng. 
For of euele tacche of a kynges child 
may come more harme to þe regne 
þan of euel tacches of eny oþer child. 
Wherfore Ʒif loue and diligense 
þat scholde be aboute a child makeþ þe more vnyte bytwene fader and moder, 
þe more diligence and besynesse scholde be aboute a kynges child 
passynge oþere children, 
þe more semeliche it is 
þat kynges and princes abide with here wifes 
withoute departynge 
while here lyues lasten. Chapter IX Among sum sectes 
it is not acounted ajenst resoun þeiƷ oo man haue manye | 
wyues at ones. 
But þat riƷth reson meneþ 
þat alle citeseyns 
and namelich kynges and princes schulde be apaied eche 
with oo wif alone 
we may preue 
by þre menes: 
þe firste is itake be þe housebonde; 
þe seconde, 
by þe wif; 
and þe þridde, by children. 
Þe firste mene is declared in þis wise: 
for as manye diuerse metes meuen and exciten to ete to muche, 
so manye wifes meuen and exciten to þe grete lust 
and likyng of lecherie. 
Wherfore by cause 
þat suche lust and likyng 
Ʒif it is strong blyndeþ 
þe wit and appeireth resoun, 
Ʒif it is vnsemelich 
to alle citeseyns 
to Ʒeue hemself 
to moche to lecherie 
and withdrawe hemself 
fro workes and dedes of prudencia, 
þat is vnsemelich to eche man 
to haue manye wifes. 
But þat is þe more vnsemeliche to kynges and princes, 
þe more prudent and wis þey schold be 
and þe more þei scholde Ʒeue hemself and þe more besy 
þei schul be aboute siuile workes and dedes 
and aboute sauacioun of þe regne passynge oþer men. 
Þanne for he scholde not 
by greet lust of lecherie be withdrawe 
fro suche cure and besinesse, 
it is vnsemelich for a kyng oþer a prince 
to haue manye wifes. 
Þe seconde mene is itake by þe wif. 
For as it is vnsemelich 
þat þe housebonde haue manye wifes 
lest he be withdrawe 
with lust of lecherie 
fro þew besynesse and cure, 
so it is vnsemeliche by cause of þe wif 
lest he be not loued of here housbonde as schue scholde. 
For betwene housbonde 
and wif scholde be gret loue, 
for as it is preued, 
viii Ethicorum, 
bytwene hem is excellent frendschipe and loue. 
For loue may strecche to manye and diuerse 
and by kynde loue. 
But for excellent loue 
may not strec|che to manye and diuerse 
as þe philosofre meneth, 
ix Ethicorum, 
it is vnsemelich 
þat eny manhaue manye wifes, 
for þanne he wol not loue hem wiþ 
so greet frendschipe and loue 
as he scholde be 
bytwene housbonde and wif. 
And namliche þat were vnsemeliche for kynges and princes 
in so moche as of here wedlok þe sauacioun of þe regne 
and of þe principate is dependant; 
þerfore þei scholde not mysvse dedes of lecherie 
betwene hem and here wifes, 
but loue of wedlok scholde specialliche be ikept bytwene hem. 
Þe þridde mene to preue 
þe same is itake 
by fedyng and norsching of children. 
For by cause of wedlok 
is som what kyndeliche, 
how it scholde be in þew manere 
it may be knowe by doynge 
þat we seen in oþere bestes. 
For as som doctourus menen, 
we seen comynliche 
þat among sum oþere beestes 
onlich þe femel suffiseth to feede and norische þe children, 
as it fareth of houndes 
and of hennes and of many oþere bestes. 
Wherfore by cause þat coniunccioun of maal and femel 
in alle beestes 
is principallich iordeyned to gendre 
and to brynge forth 
þe children and brood, 
among beestes in þe whiche onliche þe femel suffiseth to fede and norische þe children 
it is no fors þeig oo male take manye of females 
oþer no; 
noþer it is fors þeiƷ þe maal be with þe femel oþer no 
while þe femel bryngeth forþ þe brood. 
But in thulke beeste 
in þe whiche not onlich þe femal suffiseth to fede and noriche children and brood, 
oo mal scholde not take 
but oo femel and helpe 
while þe bredyng tyme dureth 
by cause of fedyng and norisching of children and brood, 
as it fareth of 
cul|ueres and of oþere manye foules and bryddes 
þat sitten on þe eireyne 
by steuenes 
and þe femel bereþ 
som charge of þe brood 
and þe male sum. 
Þanne for to bere þe charge of wedlok 
in al not oonliche 
þe femel suffiseth, 
it is kyndelyche to men 
þat oo man wedde a wif. 
For thinges ben acounted kyndelich thinges 
þat fallen comynliche and for þe more part, 
as it is kyndelich 
to a man to be riƷt honded 
þei it happe þat som men ben lift honded. 
So for comynlich 
and for þe more part 
þe femel may not alone bere þe charge of matrymonye 
and of wedlok noþer sende to þe children 
al þat hem nedeþ 
and þew fyndyng and norschynge, 
þei it happeth 
þat som wymmen ben so riche 
þat þei ben suffisant to fynde to þe children 
fedyng and norisching 
and al þat hem nedeþ – 
but for doyng 
þat falleth selde, 
in þe lasse part of special kynde is not acounted kyndeliche doynge. 
But doynge þat falleth comynliche 
and for þe more part 
is acounted kyndelich doyng, 
as among men it is acounted 
as it were kyndelich doyng 
þat boþe maal and femel bere þe charge of þe children. 
But for among oþere beestes 
in þe whiche boþe maal 
and femel bereþ charge of þe children 
while þe children hauen 
nede to fader and moder 
it is kyndeliche 
þat oo maal holde hym to oo femel, 
it folweth þat among men 
it is kyndelich þat oo male be copled by wedlok to oo femel 
while þe children hauen nede to fader and to moder. 
But for al þe while þat children lyuen a‡ neden helpe of fader and moder, 
it is semelich þat alwey 
by wedlok of mankynde 
oo male scholde holde hym to oo femel. 
And it fareth | not of men 
as it doþ of oþer beestes; 
for to oþere beestes 
kynde arayeth mete at þe folle, 
as it is iseide 
in þe firste chapitre of þe seconde book. 
And after þat bryddes of foules 
hauen fethers and comen to þew mete and mowe 
by hemself gete mete, 
þanne þey hauen no lenger nede to fader and moder. 
Wherfore Ʒif among suche bestes 
it is inow þat maal and femel be togeders 
and holde eyþer 
to [o]þer in bredyng tyme, 
but men nedeþ help and socour of fader and moder 
alle here tyme of lif, 
for to hem kynde arayeth [not] mete 
at þe fulle: 
so, among men, maal and femel 
by wedlok scholde do as maal and femel done among foulis, 
þat berin steuenis 
bi charge of childrin 
and of brode in bredinge time. 
But for it is iseide 
þat al þe bredinge time 
amonge suche foulis male and female ben togiddere and holdin hem eiþer to oþir, 
[it folweþ þat, among men, 
þei lyuen togederes in wedlok 
for alle here tyme of lif, 
and holden hem eyþer to oþer]. 
Wherefor [Ʒif] he þat wil liue in wedlok schulde holde þe ordere and manere of kynde, 
it is semelich 
þat eche citeseyn holde hym apaied with oon wif. 
And þe more kynges and princes scholde passe oþere men in goodnesse, 
þe more semelich it is þat eche kyng and prince holde hym apayed with oon wif. 
Panne it is iknowe not onliche 
by housebonde and wif 
but also by children 
þat no man schulde haue 
but oo wif in wedlok at ones. Chapter X 
They it be not acounted inconuenient among oþere naciouns 
as among Saragenes 
and oon cas amonge oþer stronge nacions 
þat oo man haue manye wifes 
at ones alyue, 
among no men noþer nacioun noþer by lawe we reden 
þat it is igrauntid 
to oo womman schul haue manye housebondes 
at ones in wedlok. 
For to workes and thinges 
þat bien iordeyned to wedloc 
it is more contrarie 
þat oo womman haue | many housebondes 
þan it is þat on man haue many wifes, 
and in þe lawe of God 
as in þe Olde Testament 
by som despensacion of God 
oþer for som fygure (bodyng) and affeccion we rede of þat 
on man had many wifes, 
nathales þyng þat is suffred selde 
and in a certeyn caas 
and for a resonable cause 
schal not destroie þe comyn lawe. 
For by comyn reson it is detestable 
þat on man haue many wyues <at onis>. 
And it were more detestable 
Ʒif a womman had many housebondes at ones, 
for wedloc may be likned to foure 
by þe 
whiche may be take foure resons by þe whiche we may preue 
þat it is detestable in alle wise 
þat oo womman haue manye housbondes at ones. 
For in wedlok firste is kynde ordre iholde; 
for it is kyndeliche 
þat womman be soget to a man 
for a man passeth a womman in prudencia, wit and wisdom. 
Þe seconde, 
by wedlok and mariage cometh pees and frendschipe, 
for we seen þat manye werres 
and stryft ben aleyd 
by wedloc and mariage bytwene parties. 
Þe þridde, 
of wedlok and mariage comeþ gendryng and getyng of children; 
for wedloc is iordeyned not oonliche to [conser]uacioun of kynde ordre and to þew pees 
but also it is iordeyned 
to gendryng and getyng of children. 
Þe ferþe, 
as wedloc is iordeyned 
to gendryn and getyng of children, 
so it is iordeyned to here 
þewe fyndyng and noresching. 
Þanne it were inconuenyent and euel sittyng 
þat oo womman haue many housebondes 
for þerby 
al þe forsaide foure scholde be bynome. 
For þereby kynde ordre were bynome 
and of suche wedloc scholde come no pees noþer acord 
but strif and enemytee, 
þere is no þewe getyng 
and gendryng of children 
noþer þew fedyng and norischyng for hem. 
And þat | þerby kynde ordre scholde be inome it is not hard to knowe, 
for as þe philosofer seith in Poletidis], 
alwey þe man scholde be aboue þe womman 
and þe womman schulde be soget to þe man. 
Also by kynde ordre 
in þe same werkes 
non man 
by hymself ben ileche soget to tweyne oþer to mo; 
and Ʒif any person [i]s soget to tweyne, 
þat is not euene ileche 
and by hymsilf 
but þat is for oon 
is iordeyned to anoþer – 
as Ʒif a citeseyn 
is sugette to þe meire 
and to þe kyng, 
þe meire mot be iordeined and soget to þe kyng. 
Þanne it is contrarie to kynde ordre 
þat oon be soget to tweyne. 
Wherfore Ʒif þe wif schulde be sugete to þe housebonde 
for sche graunteþ 
al myƷt and power of here body to oon housebonde, 
it is aƷenst kynde ordre 
Ʒif sche is soget to anoþer man. 
For þeiƷ oon man may be lord of many in 
þat þei ben manye, 
but o man may not be obedient to manye 
by kynde ordre. 
Wherforeþei itbe detestable 
þat on manhaue many wifes, 
it were more detestable Ʒif on wif hadde many housbondes. 
Þanne it is semeliche þat a citeseyns wif holde here apayed with oon housebonde; 
bote it is more semelich 
þat a wif of a kyng 
oþer a prince holde here apaied with oo housebonde, 
for it is more semelich 
þat kynde ordre be kept in here 
wedloc þanne in oþere wedlok. 
Þanne by kynde ordre it is declared 
þat oo womman scholde not haue but oon housebonde. 
Þe seconde, 
þe same may be preued by pees 
and acord to þe 
whiche wedloc is iordeyned. 
For eche man takeþ 
an yuel Ʒif he is ilet of þe vse of his owne thing 
þat is likyng to him, 
it myƷt not be withoute discord 
Ʒif oo womman hadde many | housebondes; 
for oon of hem scholde lette anoþer of þe vse of thing 
þat is likynge and þerof scholde come werre and stryf and enmyte. 
And eche of þe men oþer of þe wymmen 
scholde be meued 
to enemyte aƷenst fader and moder and cosyns of þe wyues, 
for he Ʒeaf his wif 
to be soget 
to anoþer man by wedloc. 
Þanne of wedloc 
þat is iordeyned for pees and frendschipe 
wolde come strif and discord. 
Wherfore it is semelich 
þat eche citeseins wif holde here apaied with oon housebond. 
And þe more þe strif 
and discord of kynges and princes 
is more perelos and dredful passynge 
þe strif and discord of oþere citeseyns, 
þe more semelich it is 
þat eche of here wifes holde ham apayed with oon housebonde. 
Þe þridde, 
þe same is declared 
by gendryng 
and getyng of children 
to þe whiche wedloc is iordeyned. 
For conseyuyng of children 
is ilette Ʒif oon womman takeþ manye men. 
Þerfore we vnderstondeþ 
þat comyn wymmen 
ben more bareyne þanne oþere wymmen. 
Þanne by cause of gendryng 
and getyng of children 
it is vnsemelich in alle wise þat oon womman haue many housebondes; 
for þey oon man may brynge manye wymmen wiþ child, 
Ʒut in þat wise may not oon womman conseyue and go wiþ childe 
by manye men at ones. 
But þe conceyuyng of here 
is ilette by manye men. 
Wherfore Ʒif wedloc 
is principalliche iordeyned 
for gendryng and getinge of childrin, 
lest conseiuingge be ilet, 
it is semliche 
þat eche citesins 
wif holde here apaide wiþ on vsbunde. 
And it is more semeliche þat eche kinge oþer princes 
wif holde here apaide wiþ oon vsbunde, 
for in suche wedlok bareinnesse is more perlus. 
Þanne alle wemmen | scholde besiliche take hede 
þat hauen housebondes 
with how grete besinesse he scholde kepe hemself in clene wedloc 
and be trewe to here housebondes, 
for it is detestable 
Ʒif a womman scholde take anoþer housebonde 
leuynge here owne housebonde. 
And so it is detestable 
þat schue take anoþer man liuing here housebonde. 
Þe [ferþ]e, 
we may preue þe same 
by þew fedyng and noresching of children. 
[For] fadres ben þe more besi aboute children 
Ʒif þei trowen sikerliche 
þat þe childre ben þeire owne. 
Þanne al þat letteþ siker trowyng of children 
letteþ þe fader to ordeyne 
besiliche for hem of heritage, of fedyng, 
and of norisching. 
But Ʒif oon womman hadde manye housbondes, 
þe fadres myƷt not be siker and certeyn of þe children; 
wherfore he wolde not do besiliche 
þat he scholde to ordeyne for þe children fedyng and norisching and heritage. 
Þanne it is detestable 
Ʒif oon man hath many wifes 
but it is more detestable 
Ʒif oon wif hath many housebondes 
for þerby sikernesse of children is ilett more. 
Wherfore Ʒif it is semelich 
þat citeseyns be siker 
of here owne children 
for to ordeyne 
for hem besiliche fedyng, norisching, and heritage, 
it is semelich 
þat eche citeseyns wif holde here apaied with oon housebond. 
But þe more peril may come of myskepyng 
and norisching of children of kynges and princes 
þan of myskepyng of oþere children, 
þe more semeliche it is 
þat eche wif of kyng 
and of prince holde here apaied with oon housebonde. Chapter XI‡ 
On caas sum man wolde wene þat Ʒif oon womman haþ 
but oon housebonde 
þat þe wedloc 
is laweful 
of what blood and kin euere | 
þe housbonde and wif bee. 
But þat is aƷenst resoun, 
for wedloc schal not be bytwene fader 
and douƷter noþer 
bytwene moder 
and sone noþer 
bytwene men and wymmen 
þat ben ful nyƷ of kynne. 
And þis we may preue by þre weyes: 
þe firste is itake by reuerence 
þat is in fader and moder 
and in oþere 
þat ben of nyƷ kynne; 
þe seconde is itake by good 
þat comeþ of wedloc; 
þe þridde by euel 
þat is voided by wedlok. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For by cause þat in kynde ordre 
men scholde be soget 
to fader and moder in þew manere and do þew reuerence to cosyns 
and to kynnes men, 
and for suche reuerence 
is not ikept 
bytwene housebonde and wif for dedes 
þat ben ido 
bytwene hem tweyne, 
kynde resoun ━wol┐ ━þat┐ wedloc 
scholde not be bytwene man 
and womman of to nyƷ kyn; 
for þat semeth so contrarie to kynde resoun 
þat vnnethe þer ben enny manere men 
but þei outtake som persones of wedloc. 
Þerfore [in] Polithic[is] þe philosofer 
is ilad oonliche ‡ 
by kynde resoun outtake som persones of wedloc and of mariage; 
for it was neuer laweful to man, 
noþer we fynden igraunted among nacions þat a man scholde wedde his owne moder 
and haue here to wif. 
For þe wif schuld be sogette to þe housebonde, 
and it were inconuenient 
þat þe moder scholde be sogett to þe sone oþer 
þe fader to þe douƷter 
by cause of reuerence 
þat eiþer scholde do to oþer. 
Also wedloc is not laweful 
bytwene oþere men and wymmen 
þat ben to nyƷ sibbe 
but it be on caas by dispensacioun; 
for by cause of sum greet good 
þat may come of sum wedloc, 
it is igraunted sum tyme 
in som caas to oo man and not to anoþer. | Þanne by cause of þew reuerence 
þat longeth to kynnes men 
þat may not be ikepte in doyng 
bytwene housebonde and wif, 
wedloc scholde not be bytwene men and wymmen 
þat ben to nyƷ sibbe 
but by dispensacioun 
and in certeyne caas. 
Þanne it is semelich 
þat alle cytesens take not wyues 
of al maner wymmen. 
But þe more semelich it is þat kynges and princes holde and kepe kynde ordre, 
þe more semelich is þat þei take not al manere wymmen to wyues. 
Þe seconde mene for to preue 
þe same is itake by good þat cometh of wedloc and matrymonye. 
For it was iseid 
in þe nexte chapitre tofore 
þat of wedloc and matrimonye bytwene man and womman comeþ pees, acoord, and frendschipe. 
But for bytwene kynnes men it semeth 
þat þer is frendschipe inow, 
by cause of kynde resoun wol mene 
þat contract of matrimoyne 
scholde be bytwene hem 
þat ben not to nyƷ sibbe so þat þey þat ben not frendes 
by cause of kynrede scholde be frendes 
by cause of wedloc. 
Þanne it is semeliche 
þat al men make contracte of matrimoyne with persones 
þat ben not to nyƷ sibbe. 
But þat is most semeliche for kynges and princes; 
for in þe gretter gree and heyƷere astaat þey ben inne, 
þe more hem neden affinite and frendschipe of oþere men. 
For [in] Ethic[is] 
þe philosofer seith 
þat þe heyƷer a tre is, 
þe more it nedeth to haue greet vnderstondyng 
þat it be not ouerthrowe with þe wynd. 
Þanne in þe heyƷere gre kynges and princes ben, 
þe more hem nedeþ to haue greet and manye boþe affynes, 
cosyns and frendes. 
Þe þridde mene to preue þe same 
is itake by euel 
þat is iput of by wedloc. | For by wedloc not onliche children 
ben igendred and igete 
but also þe euel of intemporancia 
is iput of for he 
þat may not be chast. 
For he schulde not be to intemporate and take alle wymmen, 
it is good to hym 
to wedde a wif 
and to holde hym 
apaied wiþ oon wif 
þat he may be withdrawe 
fro intemporatnesse. 
And for fleschlich likynge blyndeþ 
moche þe wit and vnderstondyng, 
as we hauen ofte iseid tofore, 
it is spedful to alle þat wol haue good wit 
and resoun not to vse moche lecherie. 
Þanne for bytwene persones 
þat ben nyƷ sibbe is kynde loue, 
[Ʒif þei] comeþ togedres and makeþ a grettere loue 
(and for fleschelich likyng blyndeþ wit and resoun 
as we hauen ofte seide tofore), 
bytwene suche housebonde 
and wif scholde be so greet delectacioun and likynge 
þat þei moste geue hemself 
to moche to lecherie. 
Þanne it is semeliche 
þat no citeseyns make contracte of matrimonye with persones 
þat ben to nyƷ sibbe 
lest he Ʒeue hemself to lecherie 
to moch and lest here resoun be iblend 
and þey wiþdrawe 
from þew besynesse 
and cyuyl workes and dedes. 
Þanne þis is þe more semelich for kynges and princes, 
for þei scholde more vse resoun and wit and prudencia 
þan oþere men ‡ 
and for more perel may come to þe regne Ʒif kynges and princes 
ben not besy aboute sauacioun of þe regne 
and aboute cyuyl workes and dedes. 
Þanne bytwene hem 
þat ben to nyƷ sibbe schulde be no contracte of wedloc and of matrimonye. 
But in þe þridde gree 
and þe ferþe, 
for he bygynneþ to passe furþere 
by cause of getyng 
of som good and profit oþer 
for to voide | 
som greet euel and harme, 
by dispensacioun may be contracte of matrymoyne. Chapter XII Sum good is good of þe saule as vertues 
and goode þewes, 
and sum is good of þe body as fairenesse, swepernesse and swiftnesse 
and oþere suche, 
and som good is outward good 
and stondeþ 
in þre manere good 
as it longeth to þis doyng. 
For worthi blood, many frendes, 
and greet richesse ben acounted 
among outward good 
as þe philosofer seith, primo Rethoricorum. 
Þanne Ʒif a kyng oþer a prince wol haue eny womman to wif, 
he scholde take hede 
þat þat womman be ihiƷt 
with al þes þre manere good; 
but he schal not take hede iliche principaliche 
to þis þre manere good. 
But to noble blood 
and to manye frendes among outward good 
he schal take hede 
as it were first and principalliche, 
but to grete richesse 
he schal take heede 
as it were by þe consequent folwyng. 
For it is semelich 
þat a kyng oþer a prince take such a womman to a wif 
þat is of noble blood 
and kyn by þe whiche he may haue manye frendes and noble and myƷty, 
but for to haue by þat wif greet richesse 
and catelle he schal take hede by þe consequent folwyng. 
But as it schal be declared, 
he schulde take more hede 
in his wif of noble blood 
and of manye frendes þan of greet richesse and catel; 
but in som wise he schal take hede of þis þre. 
For wedloc is iordeined, 
as it is iseid tofore, 
for þew felawschep and companye 
and for pesible beyng 
a[nd] fore sufficiant lif. 
Þan for wedlok 
is iordeyned 
for to geue felawschepe and companye, 
‡ a kyng oþer a prince mot haue a wif of noble blode; 
for it is iordeyned 
to be in pes, 
[he most haue manye frendes; 
and for it is iordeyned for sufficiant 
lif,] he most haue gret richesse and ca‡tel. 
And it is ipreued tofore 
þat wedloc is by kynde, 
for man is kyndeliche a companable | beest. 
And as þe philosofer seith [in] Poletic[is], 
þe firste kynde felauschipe and companye 
is bytwene male and femel, 
bytwene housebond and wif; 
and þat were not but wedloc 
were iordeyned for sum þewe and kynde companye. 
Þanne for bytwene a noble man and noble womman 
is þew companye, 
kynges and princes, 
þat ben of noble blood, 
for wedloc is iordeyned 
for þew and worthy companye, 
scholde take wifes of noble blood. 
Þe seconde, 
for to bee in pees 
he moste haue manye frendes, 
for pees is among men 
as hele among þe humours. 
For as we seen in þe same body 
þat of inequalite of humours 
comeþ seeknesse and dissease, 
so among men of wronges 
and of inequalitees 
þat þei vsen among hemself comeþ strif and werre. 
Wherfore as for to be hool a man 
most haue stronge kynde 
to putte of thinges 
þat noyeth and greueþ, 
so to be in pees 
nedeþ greet power and myƷt and manye frendes. 
For as þe philosofer seith [in] Rethoric[is] men don gladliche wrong 
whanne þei mowen. 
Þanne þat lackeþ 
ciuel powere and myƷt and frendes 
suffreþ ofte wrong 
and moot not lyue in pees. 
Þanne in wedloc 
may be ordeyned to lyue in pees 
and þerfore nedeþ many frendes. 
And as it is declared 
þe more helpe 
and socour nedeth 
to þe staat of kynges and princes 
and þe moo myshappes 
may falle þerto, 
þe more hem nedeþ 
to haue wifes and noble blood 
wiþ manye frendes. 
Þanne it is declared how wyues of kynges and of princes scholde bee of noble blood and wiþ many frendes. 
Þanne it is to declaryng 
how þerfore it 
nedeþ to haue greet richesse and catel. 
Wiþ þe wif most | come dowyng and richesse 
to bere þe charge of wedloc 
and for suffisant lyuynge. 
And for kynges and princes hauen greet r[i]chesse and catel 
þat suffisen to þe lif, 
it is more semlich 
þat þei haue wyues of noble blood 
wiþ cyuyl myƷt and power 
and wiþ many frendes 
þan wiþ greet richesse and money. 
For it is iknowe 
þat kynges and princes schulde haue wiþ here wifes outward good, 
it may be sone iknowe what maner wifes 
alle citeseins scholde take. 
For Ʒif kynges and princes scholde take noble wyues for to haue 
bytweyne hem pees and worthi companye, 
it semeth þat in eche wedloc to g[r]eet vneuennesse scholde be voyded. 
For Ʒif þe oon is not peere to þe oþer 
but passeth wheþer 
it be in noblenesse 
and in gentrie oþer in age, 
it is comynliche cause of strif oþer 
it is cause whi housebonde 
and wif holdeþ not fey and trouthe. 
But Ʒif oon þat is ful gentil and noble wedded oon þat is not gentil but vnworthi, 
bytwene hem is not worthi company but oon fondeþ to be mayster 
ouer þat oþer passyng þe lawes of wedloc. 
Also Ʒif a swithe olde man 
wedde a Ʒong wenche, 
for gong wenches hauen no ioye of companye of olde men, 
so greet diuersite of age schal be in som wise cause 
whi þei ben not trewe eche to oþer. 
Þanne in wedlo[c] moot be þis forseyde þre manere good outward: 
worthi blood and noble, 
many frendes, 
and greet richesse and catel, 
after þe astaat of housebond and wif, 
so þat bytwene housebonde and wif sum maner proporcioun schal be holde. Chapter XIII It is declared tofore what maner thing is wedloc, 
for it is a kyndelich thing 
and scholde not be departed 
and is | bytwene oo man and on womman. 
Also we hauen iseid and ischewed 
bytwene what persones wedloc schold be, 
for it scholde not be 
bytwene man and womman 
þat ben nyƷ sibbe. 
And also we hauen declared 
what manere outward good 
a man scholde haue with his wif. 
And now it is to spekyng 
how menne wifes scholde be ihiƷt boþe wiþ worldlich good 
and with goostlich. 
Þanne it is to wetynge þat þe philosofer, primo Rethoricorum, 
rekeneþ þe good of wymmen and seith 
þat bodilich good of wymmen 
is fairenesse and mechelnesse. 
And good of þe saule is temporancia, 
loue and besynesse withoute þraldome. 
Andtouchynge bodylichegood 
a wif scholde be fayre and moche; 
and touchyng good of þe saule 
a wif scholde namliche be temporate 
and not loue idelnesse 
but he scholde loue honest workes 
withoute þraldome, 
as it schal be declared in þe processe. 
And þat a wif scholde haue bodilich good (fayrnesse and mechelnesse) 
it may be declared in þis wise. 
For þeiƷ wedloc be iordeyned as it was iseid in þe nexte chapitre tofore 
to þew companye 
and to be in pees 
and to suffisant lyuynge, 
nathales it is iordeyned for generacioun and getynge of children 
and for to voide fornycacioun; 
and semeþ more principalliche iordeyned 
to þes tweyne þanne 
for þe forseide þre. 
For þe good of trouthe and of wedloc, 
so þat wif and housebonde be trewe eiþer to oþer and leue fornycacioun, 
helpeþ generacioun 
and to getyng of children 
and perteyneth more streigt to wedloc 
þan doþ thinges 
þat we speke of in þe nexte chapitre tofore. 
Þanne al þat semeþ helplich to make leeue fomycacioun, 
to make | housbonde 
and wif trewe 
eiþer to oþer, 
and to þewe gendryng and getyng of children 
scholde be in a wif. 
And we seen þat a moche body 
helpeth to goodnesse of a child, 
for in quantite of body children 
folwen þe moder 
for in som wise 
þey hauen of þe moder al corpulent substance. 
Þanne as in oþer bestes 
comynliche we seen 
þat grete beeste of kynde gendreth and bryngeþ forþ grete bestes, 
and so among men Ʒif fader and moder ben moche, 
comynliche þe children ben moche. 
Þanne for good and profit of children, 
for children scholde be moche of body, 
it is semelich þat alle citeseyns 
haue moche wymmen to wifes. 
And þat is most semelich 
þat kynges and princes, 
for of here children 
þe comune profit is more dependant, 
þerfore þei scholde be more besy 
þan oþere men to haue suche wyues. 
Þe [seconlde, 
among bodilich good a wif scholde be faire and wel ischape, 
for þat is good for children. 
For as mochel men and wymmen hauen comynliche mochel children, 
so comonliche faire men 
and wymmen hauen faire children. 
Wherfore [Ʒif] 
it is semelich 
þat alle citeseins and namelich kynges and princes 
to be besy 
to haue mochel children and faire, 
it is semelich þat þei haue mochel wommen to wyues and fayre. 
And it semeþ þat fairenesse of a wif i[s] not oonlich good for children, 
but it is also iordeyned for to voyde fornycacioun. 
It is iknowe touching bodilich good 
how a wif scholde be moche and faire, 
it is to wetynge touchynge good 
of þe soule 
how schue scholde be temporat, 
louynge and besy. 
For Ʒif a womman is excited 
and inclyned to þe contrarye of good, 
þat good is most nedfol in a womman. 
And it is i|seide tofore 
þat worching by resoun 
and folwyng passyons 
ben as þei it were contraries 
so þat þe more a man folweth passions 
þe lasse he worcheth 
by resoun and agenward. 
Þan þei þat hauen lasse resoun, 
for þei ben suche, 
ben þe more inclined 
to folwe passions. 
Þanne children and wymmen as moche 
as it is in hem 
folweþ passions more þan men, 
for a man is most stedefast in resoun. 
For as we seide tofore 
in þe firste book, 
temporancia chasteþ passions, 
to þe whiche passions 
wymmen ben most inclyned, 
þeig wymmen schulde haue in sum wise alle vertues; 
nathalees whanne a womman schal be wedded 
it is most neede to inquyre and aspie Ʒif schue is temporate, 
for wymmen ben most inclined to be intemporat. 
Þanne alle citeseyns schulde haue alle temporate wymmen to wyues. 
But it is most semelich 
þat kynges and princes haue suche wifes, 
for of intemporatnesse of here wyues may come more harme 
þan of intemporatnesse 
of oþere menne wyues. 
Also wyues scholde be besy. 
For whan a persone is idel, 
he is þe sonnere inclined to do aƷenst resoun. 
For as þe philosofer meneþ, 
vii Polethicorum, mannes þouƷt can not be idel. 
Þanne whanne a man 
is not occupied 
in good dedes and nedfol, 
his þouƷt passeth aboute oþere þynges 
and is ioccup[i]ed in foule thinges and þouƷtes. 
Þanne herby it is iknowe what manere thing wedloc scholde be 
and how alle citeseyns 
and nameliche kynges and princes schulde haue hemself in wyuynge. 
For ar they take wymmen to wyues, 
þei scholde aspie bysiliche, 
first, 
what outward good þei hauen, 
and how gen|til and noble þei ben of blood, 
and how þei mowe 
by suche mariage come to cyuel power 
and myƷt 
and to manye frendes. Þe seconde, 
he scholde asspie how þei ben higt with bodilich good 
as how þey ben moche of stature and bodilich faire 
and wel ischape. 
Þe þridde, 
for it is not inow to haue outward good and bodilich good 
but þer be also goostly good 
and good of þe soule, 
þey schulde aspye how wymmen 
þat þei scholde wedde ben temporate 
and besy aboute outward honest workes and dedes. Chapter XIV 
For it is not inow to wite and to knowe whaat manere þyng is wedloc 
and how a man scholde haue hymself in wyuynge 
but he knowe also how he schulde bere hymself 
to his wif 
he is iwedded, 
þerfore to þe forseide chapitres resonabeliche þis processe is annexed 
þat we may knowe how rewlyng of wedloc 
by þe whiche wyues ben irewled is distyngwed 
fro oþere manere rewlyng. 
And by twey weyes 
we may declareþat wifes 
and children 
ben irewledby diuers manere of reulyng. 
Þe firste wey is itake 
by þe manere of reulynge, 
and þe seconde, 
by worchyng and doyng. 
Þe firste is declared in þis wise. 
For philosofres menen þat þe manere reulyng 
of þe world is ikept and isaued in oon man, 
þerfore among hem man 
is icleped þe lasse world. 
For as al þe worlde 
is rewled by oon prince 
and by oon God 
þat is vnderstondyng, 
intellecte seuered and pured and not bodiliche, 
so ━al┐ ━þat┐ is in a man, 
Ʒif he scholde be rewled þewliche, 
[is rewled] 
by intellecte (vnderstondyng) and resoun; 
so þat þe manere | of rewelyng 
of þe world 
is ikepte and isaued in eche man, 
so þat Plato sauede al þe ordere of heuenes 
in eche resonable soule. 
Þanne Ʒif þe rewelyng 
of þe world 
is likned to þe rewelyng þat scholde be in o ‡man, 
and a cyte is a partie of þe worlde, 
þanne þe rewelyng of an hool cytee 
scholde be more ikepte and isaued in oon hous. 
For Ʒif an hous is more þan oon synguler man 
and a cyte lasse þan þe world, 
Ʒif þe liknesse of þe hool world 
is ikepte and isaued in oon man, 
moche more þe liknesse of þe rewlyng 
of a cyte 
is ikept and isaued in oon hous. 
Þerfore, primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer likneþ 
þe rewlyng of oon hous 
to þe reulyng of a cyte. 
And as it longeth to þis doynge, 
a cyte may be reuled 
by double manere rewlyng: 
by politik rewlyng 
and by real rewlyng. 
And he is lord by real lordschipe 
þat is lord and rewleth by avisement and by lawes 
þat he makeþ and Ʒeueþ 
and not by lawes 
þat citeseyns makeþ. 
And whan a prince 
in a cyte is prince and lord and makeþ lawys and rewleþ 
þerby þat rewlyng haþ þe name of prince 
oþer kyng 
and is icleped real rewlyng. 
But whan noþer prince 
ne kyng makeþ 
þe lawe 
but þe citeseyns, 
þanne rewlyng 
by þat lawe haþ not þe name of kyng noþer of prince noþer 
is icleped real rewlyng 
but it hath þe name of policye, 
þe comynte and of citeseyns, 
and is icleped politik rewelyng 
oþer cyuyle rewelyng. 
And [in] Poletidis], 
to þes twey manere of rewlyng 
in a cyte þe philosofer 
likneth twey manere reulynges of on hous 
by þe whiche þe fader | 
rewleth þe child 
and þe housebonde þe wif. 
For þe rewlyng paternale 
by þe whiche þe fader reuleth þe child 
is ilikned to real rewelyng, 
and þe rewelyng coniugale 
by þe whiche þe housebonde scholde rewle þe wif as it is ilikned to politifk] rewelyng. 
Fo[r] þe housebond schulde be aboue þe wif and rewle here 
by politik rewelyng, 
for he schuld rewle here certeyn 
as by lawe of wedlok and matrimoyne 
and by condiciouns and couenantes. 
But þe fader schoulde rewle þe child 
by auysement 
and as hym likeþ 
and by real rewlyng, 
for betweyne þe fader and þe childe 
is no couenant imaad 
how he scholde be rewled. 
But þe fader gouerneth 
and rewleth his child 
as hym liketh 
and as hym semeþ 
þat it is best 
and most spedfol for þe child 
as a kyng scholde rewle his men frelich as hym semeþ 
it is best and most spedful for þe men. 
Wherfore suche rewlyng 
is icleped real rewlyng. 
But alwey bytwene housebonde and wif 
is som forward and couenant 
and som wordes ispoke how þe housebond scholde bere hym to his wif. 
And þerfore suche rewlyng 
is icleped politik rewelyng, 
for it is ilikned to þat rewlyng 
by þe whiche citeseyns clepen here lord 
and schewen to hym charters 
and dedes and couenantes 
þat he scholde holde in his rewlyng. 
Þanne by þe manere of rewlyng 
it is declared 
how þe oon is politik and þe oþer real 
and how þe rewlyng patemale, faderlich, 
by þe whiche þe fader rewleth þe child 
and þe rewlyng coniugale 
by þe which þe housebond reuleþ þe wif ben diuerce. 
━For we seen þat real rewelyng is┐ ━ful and hole and kynde rewelyng, 
and politik rewelyng is┐ parcial rewelyng 
and by eleccioun. 
For he þat reweleþ realliche haþ ful and hole [rewelyng] and fre, 
and he þat rewleþ pollitiklich haþ not ful and hool rewelyng noþer symple withoute condicioun 
but bi certeyn condiciouns and couenantes. 
Also þei eche | riƷtful rewlyng be kynde rewlyng, 
Ʒut politic rewlyng be it neuere so rigtfol it is not so kynde rewelyng as ryal reulyng, 
for þat rewlyng comeþ 
in som wise by eleccioun for in suche reulynge cyteseyns chesen hem a lord. 
Herby þe dyuersite is iknowe betweyne rewlyng paternale 
by þe whiche þe fader rewleth þe child 
and þe rewlyng nupciale 
by þe whiche þe housebonde rewleþ þe wif, 
for þe fader haþ more maystrie and more hool and ful rewlyng of þe child 
þanne þe housebonde of þe wif. 
Also þe fadres lordschipe of þe child 
is more kynde lordschipe 
þanne þe housebondes lordschipe ouer þe wif, 
for in som wise þe wif 
is acounted pere to þe housebonde 
and cheseth here an housebonde. 
And children ben not icounted peres 
to þe fader noþer cheseþ 
hem a fader 
but þei ben kyndeliche igendred 
and comeþ of þe fader. 
Þanne þe lordschipe patemale 
þat þe fader haþ of oon child 
is more kyndelich 
þan þe lordschip coniugale 
þat þe housebond haþ of þe wif. 
For þeig a man be kyndelich desposed to wedloc, 
Ʒif þat he haþ þis womman or thulke to wyf 
is 
at his owne wille and free eleccioun. 
[So as a man is kyndelich ydowede to spekyng, þeiƷ he speke þis proper ío langage oþer þat, 
it is at his owne wille 
and free eleccioun.] 
Þanne þe rewelyng coniugale 
is not so kyndelich as þe rewlyng paternale, 
for in no wise children chesen hem a fader. 
It is iknowe how rewelyng coniugale 
and þe rewelyng paternale 
ben diuerse 
by þe manere of rewlyng, 
for þe oon is more symple and kyndelich 
and þe oþer is more parciale and by eleccioun; 
it may be sone iknowe how þis twey manere of rewlyng 
ben diuerse by workes and dedes. 
For þe fader scholde so rewle þe children þat he scholde ordeyne hem to oþere workes and dedes 
þan his wif, 
for children scholde lerne workys 
and dedes of cheualrye | 
and of cyuel and dure suche workes and dedes 
whan þey ben of age and wyues 
scholde not lerne suche workes and dedes 
for he schulde not vse suche workes and dedes. 
Þanne it is iknowe 
þat al citeseins 
scholde reule here wifes and children 
by dyuerse manere rewlyng 
but þat is most semelich for kynges and princes 
for þei scholde keepe and holde kynde resoun. Chapter XV It was iseid tofore 
þat in an hous ben diuerse maneres of rewlyng: 
þe rewlyng nupciale 
by þe whiche þe housebonde rewleth þe wif, 
þe rewlyng patemal 
by þe whiche þe fader rewleþ þe child, 
and þe rewlyng domynatiuum 
þat is lordes rewle 
by þe whiche a lord rewleþ his seruantes. 
Þanne after, 
we hauen distyngwed 
bytwene rewlynges coniugale, 
þat is rewlyng of wedloc, 
and patemale, 
þat is fader rewlyng, 
[for paternale] 
is more ful and hool rewlyng 
and symple withoute condicioun, 
and þe rewlyng nupciale is parciale. 
And for þe paternale rewlyng 
is more kyndelich 
and þe nupciale rewlyng is in som wise by eleccioun, 
also for wif and semant ben iordeyned 
to dyuerse workes and dedes, 
it is to declarynge how þe wif and seruant scholde be diuersliche irewled. 
And þat a man scholde not bylede his wif 
as a seruant we may preue by þre weyes: 
þe firste is itake by kynde ordre, 
þe seconde by perfeccioun of hous, 
þe þridde by þat þe housebonde 
and wif ben peres. 
Þe firste mene is declared in þis wise. 
For al þe hool kynde is imeued and irewled by God 
and by angelis; 
and as þe philosofre seith in libro De Fortuna, 
þe kynde inclynacioun and excityng 
þat we hauen in þe soule we hauen of God 
as of hym 
þat meueþ | 
al þe hole kynde. 
Þanne as in a crafty work 
þat is imaad and iwroƷt [by] 
a wis crafty worchere 
is not ifounde to moche ne to lyte, 
so kynde, 
but it be ylette, 
worcheþ not to moche noþer doþ 
superfluyte noþer failleþ 
in nedful thinges and necessarie. 
For kynde is imeued and irewled by þe most wis crafty worchere þat is God. 
Þanne al þyng þat kynde makeþ and ordeyneth 
moot be moost ordenate, 
for he rewleth kynde of þe whiche al ordre comeþ. 
Þanne for a thing 
is best iordeyned and most ordynate 
whan oon is iordeyned to oon office, 
for þe wif is kyndeliche iordeyned 
for gendryng and getyng of children, 
þanne he schal not be iordeyned to seruyng. 
Þerfore it is iseide, primo Poleticorum, 
þat wif and seruant ben kyndelich distingwed and dyuerse; 
for as he seith þere, 
kynde doþ no thyng noþer makeþ 
as smeþis maade a swerd Delficus for suche men. 
For among Delphes were swerdes imaad for poore men 
so 
þat oon swerd seruede to many office, 
as pore men þat myƷte not haue many instrumentes 
lette make oon instrument 
þat myƷte serue in many offis. 
But kynde doþ not soo; 
but for kynde thinges 
scholde be þe bettre, 
alwey on thing is iordeyned to oon offis. 
Þerfore þe philosofre 
seith þat eche instrument 
doþ best his work 
Ʒif it 
se[ru]eth not to many workes 
and dyuerse 
but onlich to oon. 
Wherfore for kynde ordeyneth 
þe wif to conseyuyng 
and to beryng of children, 
it were vnsemelich 
þat sche were iordeyned to seruynge. 
Þanne it were not kynde ordre Ʒif þe housebond 
rewled þe wif 
by þe same manere rewlyng | 
by þe whiche a lord rewleth his seruantes. 
But þeiƷ it be in þis wise by kynde ordre, 
Ʒit among som men and nacions, 
among barbares and stronge men, 
þe wif is seruant, 
as þe philosofer seith, i Poleticorum, 
and seith 
þat among barbaros and stronge men, 
wif and seruant hauen þe same ordre 
for þei vsed here wifes as seruantes. 
But þat was, 
as it is iseid þere, 
for among suche barbares ━is no kyndelich prince; 
but swiche [barbare]s┐ ┐ben kyndelich straunge and seruant, 
[for] he is barbarus 
þat is strange 
to a man┐ and ‡ is not vnderstonde of hym, 
for a man is barbarus to anoþer 
for þe oþer 
vnderstondeþ hymnot. 
And so a Duchesch manis barbarus toan Italian 
and a Italian is barbarus to an Englische man. 
And he is sympelliche barbarus 
withoute condicioun 
þat is strange to hymself 
and woot not what he hymself meneth; 
but þat may not be 
but hym lacke vnderstondyng 
and vse of reson. 
And for he þat lackeþ vse of resoun 
is kyndelich a seruant 
for he 
can not rewle hymself, 
it is spedful to hym 
to be rewled of som oþer. 
He þat is barbarus by kynde is seruant be kynde. 
Wherfore Ʒif among þe barbarus 
wif and seruant 
haue þe same ordre, 
þat is for defaute of reson; 
for þey kunne not distyngwe 
bytwene þe manere of rewelyng of wif and of seruant. 
Wherfore Ʒif it is semelich 
þat alle citeseyns 
be wise 
and redy and knowe 
þe kynde manere and ordre, 
it is vnsemelich to hem 
to vse here wyfes as seruantes. 
Bot þat is more vnsemelich for kynges and princes, 
for it is more vnsemelich 
þat þei ben barbarus 
and lacke wit and resoun. 
Þanne by kynde ordre 
it is declared þat rewlyng coniugale 
and rewlyng seruyle ben diuerse 
and þat wifes 
scholde not be ivsed as seruantes; 
by rewelyng coniugale þe housebonde rewleþ þe wif and | by rewelyng seruyle 
þe lord rewleth his seruantes. 
Þe seconde wey to preue 
þe same is itake 
by perfeccioun of hous. 
For an hous semeth vnparfit wiþ scarsete of thinges 
and not suffisaunt to hitself 
in leuynge Ʒif wif and seruant hauen the same ordre. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
vi Poleticorum, 
þat pore men, 
[for þei] hauen not many seruantes 
noþer plente of thinges 
þat nedeþ to þe perfeccioun of an hous, 
þei vsen here wifes and children 
as it were seruantes. 
Þe þridde mene is itake by þat þat housebonde 
and wif ben peres. 
For þei þe housebonde 
be aboue þe wif, 
he can more resoun; 
Ʒit he scholde not be so moche aboue here 
þat he scholde vse here 
as a seruant 
but as a felawe. 
For þe housebonde is not so moche aboue þe wif 
as þe lord is aboue þe seruant, 
but þe housebonde and wif ben acounted peres in som wise. Chapter XVI 
As in þe firste [book we hauen iseid], 
vniuersale speche helpeþ [lasse] in moral mater. 
Þanne it is al oþer 
to trete of wedloc 
and of rewlyng of wedlok 
þan it is to trete of rewlyng of children and of seruantes. 
And to declare hou þe housebond 
schal haue hym to his wif 
and þat a schal haue [hym] 
oþer wyse to his wif 
þan to seruantes and children, 
suche declarynge is ful vnyuersal techynge and lore of wedloc 
and what manere thing wedloc is 
and how it scholde be ivsed. 
Þanne we mote come adoune more particulerliche 
and declare how alle citeseyns 
and nameliche kynges and princes scholde vse þe copulacioun of wedloc. 
Þanne vnyuersal speche 
in moral matere scholde not be forsake; 
for ofte ‡ whan þe vniuersales ben vnknowe, 
þe particulers ben vnknowe. 
Naþales particuler speche | 
scholde be do to vniuersal speche, 
for moral matier stondeþ 
in singuler 
as þe philosofer meneþ, 
ii Ethicorum. 
Þerfore in suche doynge particuler speche helpeþ most. 
Þerfore it is to declarynge particulerlich 
in what age wedloc schulde be vsed, 
† 
and þat we may declare by foure resons†: 
þe firste is itake 
by hurtynge and greuynge of children; 
þe seconde, 
by þe intemporatnesse of wymmen; 
þe þridde, 
by pereles of hem; 
þe ferþe, 
by euel and harme of men. 
Þe firste resoun 
is declared in þis wise. 
For Ʒif housebonde and wif gendreþ togedres to Ʒong, 
as þe philosofer preueth [in Pol]ethic[is], 
þe children ben ihurt in þe body. 
For comynlich þei ben feble in body and inparfit, 
and ben also ihert in þe soule: 
for comynliche þei 
þat ben so ibore lacken good wit and resoun. 
And so we seen in oþer kynde þynges; 
for whan a thing gendreth and bryngeþ 
forþ anoþer Ʒif þe thing 
þat gendreth is inparfit, 
þe þyng þat is igendred mot be inparfit. 
As Ʒif an hoot thing gendreth heete Ʒif þat hoot þyng is not parfitliche hoot, 
þe heete þat comeþ 
þerof is inparfit. 
Also Ʒif a þyng schal be maad hoot, 
it mot be disposed to [flonge heete; 
and Ʒif it is inparfidiche disposed to suche fongynge, 
it fongeth suche heete inparfitliche. 
Wherfore Ʒif þe coniunccioun of wif and housebonde 
nedeþ to þe tperfecciounf of children, 
Ʒif þe housebonde and wif ben to Ʒonge for here bodyes ben inparfit 
[and] ben not icome to þew complement, 
children þat comen of suche coniunccioun 
ben inparfit and feble of body. 
Wherfore of gendryng 
in to Ʒong age comeþ hurtynge of bodyes of chil|dren. 
Also by suche coniunccioun children 
ben ihert not onlich in body 
but also in soule. 
For by cause þat þe soule 
folweþ þe complexioun of þe body, 
whan a man is not wel proporcionate noþer disposed in þe body 
noþer wel complexionate his soule is ilette 
þat it may not wel knowe thinges 
þat he scholde knowe noþer do actus and dedes of greet wit and wynnynge. 
Þanne children 
þat comeþ of suche generacioun 
ben inparfit 
not oonlich in bodye 
but also in soule. 
Þanne it is semeliche 
þat no citeseyns vse wedloc 
while þei ben to Ʒoung; 
but þat is most semeliche for kynges and princes 
for þei scholde be more besi 
þat h[ere] children 
ben faire and wel ischape of body 
and wis and wiƷti. 
Þanne þouƷ þey wedde wifes in Ʒonge age, 
þei scholde not vse 
þe dede of wedloc 
but in parfit age. 
Þe seconde for to preue þe same is itake 
by intemporatnesse of wymmen. 
For Ʒif wymmen 
þat ben to yonge vseþ þe dede of wedloc, 
not onlich children ben ihert 
but also þe wymmen ben in al intemporat and lechours. 
For eche persoun haþ greet desire and greet talent 
to þyng 
þat he vseþ in greet Ʒouþe. 
Þerfore, vii Poleticorum, 
it is iseid 
þat þilke wymmen ben most intemporat 
þat vseþ 
þe dede of wedloc 
while þei ben Ʒonge wenches. 
Þe þridde mene is itake 
by perel of wymmen. 
For as it is iseid [in] Polethic[is], 
for in trauaille of child Ʒonge wenches 
hauen most woo and sorwe 
and þerfore manye ben ilost and iperisched, 
þerfore as þe philosofer meneþ 
it was an vsage among nacions 
in olde tyme 
to make special prayers for Ʒonge wenches in trauaile of child in tokyn þat Ʒong wennches ben in more peril 
þan oþere wymmen. 
Þe ferþe mene is itake 
by euel and harm of þe houstbonde]. 
| Housebondes ben ihert and hauen harme Ʒif þei vsen þe dede of wedloc in greet Ʒouthe. 
Þerfore it is iseid [in] Poleticfis] 
þat bodies of maales ben ihurt Ʒif þei vsen lecherie in greet Ʒouþe. 
Wherfore Ʒif suche harme may come of vse of wedloc 
in to greet 30uþe to housebondes, wyues, and children, 
kynges and princes scholde principaliche forsake þe dede of wedloc 
in to greet Ʒouthe. 
But Ʒif it is iaxed what tyme nedeþ in wyfes, 
it semeþ þat þe philosofer wol mene þat þe wif scholde be eiƷtene Ʒere oold; 
and þe housebond most be more. 
For Ʒif it is greuous to maales 
to vse þe dedes of wedloc 
al þe wexyng tyme, 
and comynliche in men 
þe wexinge tyme conteyneþ þryes seuene Ʒeer, 
it semeþ þat after þe þridde seuene Ʒeer is good tyme 
to vse þe dedes of wedloc. 
But for þe vertue of generacioun scholde not be to swythe corrupte, 
it may be doo tofore suche a tyme Ʒif it semeþ þat it is to doyng. Chapter XVII The philosofer, [v]ii Poleticorum, 
after þat he preuede by manie resons 
þat me scholde not vse 
þe dede of wedloc 
in to greet Ʒouþe, 
he inquyreth what tyme it is best to gendre 
and to gete children. 
And seith þat boþe natural clerkes and phisicians graunteþ 
þat it is bettre to vse 
þe dede of wedloc 
in coold tyme 
whanne þe norþeme wynd bloweth þanne in hoot tyme 
whanne þe southeme wynd bloweth. 
And þis we may preue by þre weyes: 
þe firste is itake by wymmen; 
þe seconde, 
by hurtynge of housebondes; 
þe þirdde, 
by disposicioun of þe eyre. 
Sum men assigneth þe firste wey in þis wise. 
For in hoot tyme smale hooles and pores of þe body 
ben opene and þe moystere | 
passeth out and þe bodies ben drye. 
Also whanne þe smale holes 
and pores ben opene, 
kynde hete passeþ out 
and þe bodies ben colde wiþinne. 
And þis eche man may knowe in hymself; 
for in cold tyme whanne þe northerne wynd bloweth is best digestioun, 
for þanne colde holdeþ inne kynde hete and passeþ not out 
but is igendred wiþinne and is þe more strong. 
Wherfore in wynter tyme 
whanne northerne wynd bloweþ 
men ben more hoot, 
for kynde heete passeþ not out, 
and ben þe more moyst, 
for þe moystere þey ben wiþinne, 
‡ men ben þe more able to generacioun and getynge of children. 
And on caas 
in a suche tyme ben moost males 
igendred and igete. 
And þerfore it semeth 
þat þe philosofer wolde mene þat scheep conceyueth males 
whan þe northerne wynd bloweth and femeles 
whan þe southerne wynd bloweþ. 
And in alle wyse whanne þe northeme wynd bloweþ 
þe hete of þe moder wombe is þe more myƷty and strong and þe moder may þe better kepe and saue whaat schue conceyueþ. 
Þe seconde to preue þe same is itake 
by hurtynge of housbondes. 
For housebondes ben more ihurt and igreued Ʒif þey vsen þe dede of wedloc 
in hoot tyme 
whanne þe southeme wynd bloweth þanne in coold tyme 
whanne þe northerne wynd bloweþ; 
for whanne þe cold northerne wynd bloweth, 
kynde heete is more ikepte wyþinne 
and we hauen better digestioun 
and mete and drynke turneþ more to norishyng. 
Wherfore in suche a tyme vse of þe dede of wedloc greueth not bodies of men 
so sore noþer apeyreth | hem, 
for mete and drynke tumeþ more to norisching. 
Þe þridde wey to preue 
þe same is itake 
by þe eire 
and by disposicioun þerof. 
For þe northeme wynd makeþ þe eyre pure and cleer 
and þe southerne wynd 
maketh it trouble and þikke. 
For as þe philosofer seith [in] Metheorfis], 
þe southerne wynd bryngeþ moche reyn; 
and whanne þe eire is pure and cleer, 
þe complexioun of hem 
þat ben þerinne ben þe bettere 
and þanne is best generacioun. 
Wherfore in suche a tyme 
þe dede of wedloc scholde be most ivsed. 
And it is semelich 
þat alle citeseyns 
vse þe dede of wedloc 
in þe tyme 
in þe whiche is best generacioun and getynge of children. 
But þat is most semelich for kynges and princes, 
for it is semeliche 
þat þei haue moost semelich children 
and wel ischape. Chapter XVIII Comynliche in maners wymmen faren as children. 
In sum wise femeles ben, 
oþer semeþ þat þei ben, 
in comparisoun to maules as children 
of inparfit age 
to men of fol age. 
For as þe philosofer seith [in] Poletictis], 
maules kunneþ more resoun þan femelles, 
for femel is as it were a maule ilikned 
and as a man not compleet and parfit. 
Also children cunneþ not so moche resoun 
as men of ful age, 
for a childe is as it were a man not compleet and parfit. 
Þanne for in comparisoun 
to not compleet perfeccioun 
and to þe vse of resoun 
in som wise wymmen and children 
hauen þe same resoun. 
And so it folweth þat in som wise 
in maneres wymmen varieth as children. 
In þe firste book 
þere we treted vnyuersaliche of maners 
and of þewes we made no special chapitre of | maners 
and of þewes ‡ of wymmen, 
but we supposede þat me myƷte coniecte and gesse of suche maners [of maners] of children. 
But for in þis seconde book 
þe rewlyng of wyues axen a special tretes 
þat we may wete and knowe 
by whaat rewelyng 
wyues scholde be rewled, 
it is schortlych to rekenyng 
what is to preysyng 
and what is to blamyng in wymmen. 
And first, wymmen ben to preysynge, 
for þei ben comynlich schamefast 
and þat is for double cause: first, 
for þei desiren to be preysed; 
þe seconde, 
for þei ben ferful of herte. 
And wymmen desiren greetlich to be preysed for al þat ben inparfit desiren more to be ipreysed 
þan þulke þat ben parfit, 
as inparfit clerkes 
þat hauen vnparfite connynge desiren more to be cleped cunnynge 
and to haue þe name 
þat þei ben excellent clerkes 
þan don clerkes 
þat ben verreyliche cunnynge. 
For þei þat ben verreyliche connynge hauen ioye of þat þat is in hymself 
and reccheþ not þerfore so moche to be holde connyng. 
But þei þat ben inparfitlich conyng, 
for þei fynden non connyng in hemself 
wherof he scholde be glad, 
what þei hauen not in dede þey wolle haue in opynyoun of man. 
Þanne what is iseid of parfit connynge and vnparfit schal be vnderstonde of parfit goodnesse and vnparfit. 
For þei þat ben parfitliche good desiren not so moche to be preysed 
and iholde good as doþ oþere þat ben vnparfitlich good; 
for þei þat ben parfitliche good mowe [ben] glad of þat þei hauen 
in hemself and reccheþ þerfore 
but lite to haue ioye of opynyoun of men. 
Wherfore by cause þat wymen ben not comynliche so good as men, 
Ʒif | þey hauen eny goodnesse 
as goodnesse of body – as Ʒif þei ben faire and semeliche oþer hauen eny oþer goodnesse 
– þei desiren moche to be preysed. 
And al þat comeþ of inperfeccioun of goodnesse, 
for goodnesse of þe body 
as fairenesse and semlich schap 
and oþere suche is inparfit goodnesse. 
Þanne comynlich wymmen hauen inparfit goodnesse 
as goodnesse of þe body. 
And Ʒif þei [hau]en parfit goodnesse 
as goodnesse of þe <soule>, 
þei hauen þat goodnesse 
in an vnparfit manere in so moche 
þat comynliche wymmen failen moche of perfeccioun of men. 
And for by wexinge of parfit goodnesse desire of preysyng abateth, 
comynlich for to speke þe more vnparfit wymmen ben passyng men 
þe more he desireth 
to be preysed more þan men. 
Wherfore by cause 
þat schamefastnesse 
is drede of vnworschep 
and of lost of preysyng, 
wymmen ben schamefast 
for þei dreden vnworschip 
and lost of preysyng 
þat þei louen so gretlich. 
Þanne by desire of preysyng 
it is preued 
þat wymmen ben schamefast. 
Also þe same may be preued 
by ferfolnesse of herte. 
For by cause þat wymmen ben alwey kyndelich ferfol and dreden nyƷ al þyng, 
it folweth þat þei ben schamefast. 
For schamefastnesse 
is a manere drede 
as it is iseide tofore. 
Þanne by diuerse causes we may preue 
þat wymmen ben schamefast. 
But hou it euere be of þe cause þerof, 
wymmen [scholde] ben schamefast; 
for by cause of schamefastnesse 
þei leuen and forsaken many foule dedes 
þe whiche þei wolde not leue 
noþer forsake ner 
þat þei ben constreyned and wiþholde | 
by chaynes of schamefastnesse. 
Þe seconde, 
wymmen ben to preysyng, 
for comynlich þei ben mylde and merciable. 
For comynliche wymmen, 
children and olde men ben merciable 
but not for þe same cause. 
For as it is iseid tofore, 
children ben merciable 
for þei ben innocent and demiþ and trowiþ 
þat oþir ben innocent 
and hauin harme with wronge 
and hauin þerfore sone merci of hem. 
And olde men ben merciable for þei faillen in body and lif, 
and hauen mercy and rewþe of oþere men 
for oþere men 
scholde haue mercye and rewþe of hem. 
For man is sone inclined for to do to oþere men 
as he wolde 
þat oþere men dede to hym, 
þerfore olde men hauen sone mercye 
and rewþe of oþere men. 
And wymmen ben merciable 
for þei ben nesche of herte; 
for þei þat ben nesche of herte mowe not suffry hard doyng. 
Þerfore wymmen hauen mercye and rewþe anon 
whanne he seeþ oþere suffre harde peyns. 
Þe þridde is to wetynge of wymmen, 
for comynlich whan wymmen ben mylde 
þei ben swithe mylde, 
and whanne þei ben crewel 
þei ben swiþe cruel, 
and whan þei ben schameles 
þei ben to schameles. 
For whanne wymmen ben bolde to do foule dedes, 
þei doun so foule dedes 
þat vnneþe a man scholde be founde to do so foule dedes 
and be so schameles. 
Þei þis þridde be ipreysed in good, 
Ʒut in iuel it is to blamyng. 
For it is iknowe 
what is to preysyng in wymmen, 
it is to rekenyng 
what is to blamyng in hem. 
And we may specialliche in wymmen 
fynde þre þat ben to blamynge: first, 
for comonliche þei ben vicious and folwen passions; 
þe seconde, 
for þei ianglen moche and stryuen and | chiden; 
þe þridde, 
for þei ben vnstedefast and vnstable. First, 
wymmen folwen passions 
whanne þei mowe and ben intemporate, 
for in hem lackeþ resoun and hauen not whareby he scholde be withdrawe 
fro lust and likyng 
as a man haþ 
þat is more irewled by resoun. 
Þe seconde, wymmen ianglen and stryuen and chiden; 
and þat is for þe same cause, 
for comynlich resoun 
is not þe brydel of a womman for comynliche hem lakken resoun. 
But schamefastnesse brideleth a womman more þan resoun; 
and Ʒif wymmen ben conty[n]ent and iangleth not noþer stryuen noþer chiden, 
þat is more for schamefastnesse 
þan for resoun. 
Wherfore whanne þei ben imeued þei conne not chaste hemself 
bote ianglen and chiden 
wiþoute bridel, 
for we seen þat wymmen ianglen and chiden lenger þan men for þei hauen lasse resoun þan men. 
Þe þridde, 
wymmen ben vnstedefast and vnstable, 
and oon caas þat comeþ of feble complexioun. 
For as it is iseid tofore comynliche þe soule 
folweþ þe complexioun of þe body. 
Þerfore as wymmen hauen nesche bodi and vnstable, 
so þei ben nesche and vnstable in desire and in wil. Chapter XIX 
It is iseid tofore 
þat wyues, children and seruantes 
scholde not be rewled 
by on manere rewlyng, 
for þe housebonde scholde rewle his wif 
oþer wise 
þan his children oþer seruantes. 
Bote for it is not inouƷ 
to trete vnyuersaliche of rewelyng of wifes tellyng 
þat it is in anoþer manere rewlyng þan rewlyng of children and of seruantes 
but it be treted specialliche 
by what rewelyng wyues schulde be rewled, 
þerfore it nedeþ to speke 
in special som what of rewlyng of wyues. 
Þanne it | is to wetyng 
þat oon is a comyne rewle 
to al maner rewlyng; 
f. sov for who euere be 
þat wil reule eny thing wel moot haue special cautels 
to amende þe defautes of þyng 
þat schal be rewled. 
For as it fareth in spekyng, 
so it fareth in som wise in workes and dedes. 
For we seen þat some men ben parfit and renable of speche 
and som men stameren and boffen. 
And þei þat stameren and boffen [ben] not al in o wyse, 
for it is hardere 
to som men to speke oo word 
and for som to speke anoþer. 
And who þat wolde rewle stamerers and boffers in spekynge moste teche hem to take a special strif 
and special fondyng 
and afforsyng to speke þe wordes 
þat þei mowe worst speke. 
For we reden 
þat sum philosofres 
dede in þe same wise, 
for þei were ilette 
in þe tonge 
and ofte fondede to sowne þe letters 
þat þei myƷte worste sowne and were so imaad parfit and renable of speche. 
Þanne in þis wise 
it most be in workes and dedes; 
for whanne a man knoweth 
þe defaute of hymself oþer of anoþer, 
Ʒif he wol rewle hymself oþer anoþer arigt, 
he moot specialliche fonde to amende þe defautes 
in þe beste wise 
þat he can 
and in sum esy manere. 
Wherfore by cause þat wymmen, 
as it was iseid 
in þe nexte chapitre, 
comynliche ben intemporate, 
fol of iangelynge and vnstedefast and vnstable, 
he mot be rewled 
by suche rewiyng 
þat he be brouƷt to be temporate, 
softe and stille, stedefast and stable. 
As it was iseid in þe firste book, 
þe partees of temporancia 
ben foure – chastite, honeste, abstinence and sobernesse. 
And wymmen ben temporate 
whanne þei ben chast, honest, abstinent and sobre. 
And wifes scholde be chast not oon|liche 
for to be trewe 
to here housbondes 
but also for conseyuyng 
and beryng of children. 
For Ʒif a wif ys not chast 
and trewe to here housebond, 
it may liƷtliche happe þat anoþer child 
þan his owne schal be þe housebondes eyre. 
Þan it is semelich 
þat al citeseyns wifes be chast. 
And þat is more semlich for wyues of kynges and princes, 
for of here mysgetyng children 
may com more discord and strif. 
Þe ii, it is semlich 
þat wifes ben honest; 
for it is not inow for wyfes 
to be chast and kepe hemself 
fro vnlaweful workes and dedes, 
but þei moot also be pudic and honest 
for to be war of tokenes and of wordes 
þat semen mene 
to be vnhonest 
and is tokene þerof. 
For it is not inow 
þat anoþer mannys child be not heire, 
but it nedeþ 
þat þe fader be siker and certeyne 
of his owne childe. 
Þanne for vnhonest tokenes and signes maken suspecioun of incontinent wyues, 
þat þe fader may be syker and certayn of his owne childe 
it is spedful 
þat wyues be honest. 
Þe þridde, 
wyues mot be abstinent, 
for to be waar of superfluyte of mete 
and of drynke 
is cause of incontinencia. 
Þe ferþe, wifes mot be sobre 
and war of to moche drynke. 
For superfluyte boþe of mete 
and of drynke 
is cause of lust 
and of likynge of lecherie. 
Þerfore in olde tyme among wymmen of Rome, 
as Valerius Maximus seith, libro ii, capitulo De Institutis Antiquis, 
how it was not laweful to drynke wyne. 
Þerfore he seith 
þat vse of wyne was vnknowe to wymmen of Rome 
lest it scholde brynge hem to schame and velanye, 
for ofte vse of wyne 
was next to þe most venus. 
Þanne wyues scholde be so irewled 
þat þei scholde be chast, honest, abstinent and sobre. 
And þe manere 
by þe whiche wyues scholde be ibrouƷt 
to al þese is dyuerse as housebondes 
ben diuerse 
in gentellesse | and richesse. 
[For citeseyns þat ben lackyng 
in gentellesse and richesse] 
scholde by hemself informe and teche here 
wyues and vse þew cauteles to make here wyues good in þe manere of goodnesse [as] 
it is iseid tofore. 
But riche men and lordes 
þat ben gentile and hauen cyuyle myƷt and power scholde aspie wymmen of good fame 
and of good age, wiƷse, 
and of good maners 
and þewes to teche here 
wyues and brynge hem 
in by þew monyciouns 
and techynge to be chaast, honest, and sobre, 
and to haue þe goodnesse 
þat is irekened tofore. 
It is iknowe 
how wyues scholde be rewled 
to be temporate 
and it is to declaryng 
how þey scholde be irewled 
to be soft and stille. 
For as it is iwrete, primo Poleticorum, 
ornament of wymmen is silens; 
for Ʒif wymmen hauen silens 
as þei scholde, 
þei semen þerby þe more omate 
and ihiƷt 
and þe bettre iloued of here housebondes. 
Þanne it is semelich 
þat wyues be softe and stille; 
and also it is semelich 
þat þei ben stedefast and stable, 
for þe more stedefast and sad and stable 
a wif is þe bettre a housebond troweþ 
þat he doþ as sche scholde. 
Þanne by suche rewlenge wyues scholde be reuled to haue þe forseyde sixe propretees and goodnesse 
þat þei ben chaast, honest, stille, abstynent, sobre and stable. 
And to alle þese þe housebondes 
may brynge hem by hemself 
oþer by wymmen of good loos and of good fame. 
Wherfore it is semelich 
þat alle cyteseyns rewle so here wyues; 
and þe more perel may come to 
þe regne of euel rewlyng of wyues of kynges and princes, 
þe more semeliche it is 
þat þei rewle so here wyues. Chapter XX 
[I]t is not inow to wite 
and to knowe how kynges and princes 
and generallich al citeseyns scholde rewle here wyues and to | what goodnesse 
þey scholde brynge here wyues 
but it be also iknowe how þei scholde bere and haue hemself to here wyues. 
And as it longeth to þis doyng, 
þre mote be knowe in þe whiche housbondes 
scholde bere and haue hemself 
wel to here wyues. 
For firste, 
þei scholde vse here wyues þewliche and moderatliche; 
þe seconde, 
þei scholde trete hem worschepfullich. 
Þe þridde, 
þey scholde abyde wiþ hem in þew tyme. 
Housebondes scholde vse here wyues moderatliche and wisliche 
for inmoderate and passyng vse of lecherie, first, destroyen þe body; 
þe seconde, 
it bereth doun þe soule; 
þe þridde, 
it defouleth appetit and talent 
and makeþ wyues intemporate. 
Þe body of þe housebonde is destroyed 
Ʒif þei Ʒeuen hem to moche to þe doynge of wedloc, 
for þe vertue of generacioun 
is to swythe corrupt; 
and as þe philosofre meneþ, iii Ethicorum, 
þe appetite of suche lust and likyng 
may not haue ynow for comynliche 
a man desireth more þan kynde nedeþ. 
Þanne Ʒif a man folwen þe appetite of doynge of wedloc 
wiþoute bridel of refraynyng, 
þanne he doþ more þanne kynde nedeþ 
and spendeþ and wasteþ hymself in more þan may be restored. And þat may not be wiþoute feblyng of his owne body, 
for þe brayn and siƷt and oþere lemes and membres 
ben ifebled and apayred 
by to greet vse of dede of wedloc. 
Þe seconde, 
to greet vse þerof not oonliche febleþ 
þe body 
but apeyreth and bereþ doun þe soule also. 
For þe body is þe instrument of þe soule; 
and as þe hamer is instrument of þe smyth, 
and Ʒif þe hamer is febled and apayred, 
þe | ‡ smethes woork is apeyred. 
And so Ʒif þe brayn 
and oþere noble membris 
ben febled and apaired, 
þe soule is ilette of þe vse of resoun 
so þat he may not haue witte and knoweleche att þe fulle. 
Þerfore it is preued tofore 
by auctorite of þe philosofer 
þat suche passynge and ouer doyng smyteþ þe resoun. 
Þe þridde, 
suche doynge to moche ivsed defouleþ 
þe appetite and makeþ wymmen intemporate; 
for the more þey vsen lecherie, 
þe more appetite is excited 
to þe dede of lecherie, 
as þe philosofer meneþ, [vii Ethicorum. 
And þerfore þe lewed mevyng a meneþ 
of som men is ipreued lewed: 
þei menen þat þey now wollen do þe dede of lust and likynge and absteyne ham afterward. 
For eche vse of suche fleschliche likynge exciten to vse it more afterward; 
and þe more a persone vseþ it, 
þe more he is excited 
to vse suche a dede 
and is alwey 
þe more intemporate and more. 
Þanne it is semelich 
þat alle citeseyns vse moderatliche 
þe fleschliche doyng of wedloc. 
And þe more vnsemeliche it is þat kynges and princes be apeyred in body 
by suche doynge 
and haue þe soule apeyred 
and þe appetite intemporate, 
þe more semelich it is 
þat þei vse suche doynge temporatliche. 
And it is not inow for hem to vse suche doynge moderatliche but þei vse 
it also wisliche and redyliche. 
For in alle workes and dedes 
mot be wisdom and redinesse so 
þat it be doun 
in þewe tyme 
and in couenable place and manere. 
For som tyme soche doyng moot bee spared, 
for in tyme of bedes and of prayers 
suche doyng scholde be spared; 
and also whanne harme and greef scholde come 
of suche doynge, 
suche doyng | scholde be spared. 
Þanne it most be do 
in þew tyme 
and in couenable place 
and in conuenient manere, 
for bytwene housebonde and wyf scholde not be onlich likynge frendschipe 
but also honest frendschipe. 
For it is iknowe how housebondes 
scholde moderatliche vse here 
wyues and rediliche, 
it is to declarynge how þei scholde trete here wyues honestliche. 
For by þe staat and faculte of richesse eche housebond 
scholde araye his wif 
and fynde here 
whaat here nedeþ. 
For þe wif is a persone faste iioyned to þe housebonde, 
and þerfore whaat is worschepe 
to þe wif 
is worschep to þe housebonde. 
And for it is declared tofore þat wif is not to þe housebonde 
as his seruant 
but as is his felawe, eche housebonde scholde trete and araye his owne wyf after his owne estate. 
For it is declared how housebondes scholde moderatliche, wisliche, and rediliche vse here 
wyues 
and howþei scholde trete hem worschepliche, 
it is to declarynge whaat conuersacioun housebondes 
scholde haue to here wyues. 
And housebondes hauen good conuersacioun 
with here wyues Ʒif þey schewen to hem tokenes of loue and of frendschipe 
and Ʒif þei taken hem 
by good informacioun and loore. 
And þewe signes and tokenes and frendschipe and couenable informacioun and lore 
may not be declared 
but [by] takynge hede of dyuerse states and condiciouns of persones. 
For þe housebonde scholde besiliche take hede wheþer here 
wyues ben proute oþer meke and wheþer þey ben wyse oþer foles. 
For housebondes scholde haue such conuersacioun with here wifes 
so 
þat þei schulde schewe mo tokenes of loue to hem 
þat ben meke þan to hem 
þat ben proute; 
| for proute wyues ben so stoute of herte 
þat Ʒif þe housebonde schewe to hem many tokenes of loue, 
þey wollen fonde to be here housebondes maistres and ladies. 
Also housebondes schulde haue suche conuersacioun with here wifes 
þat wise wyues and foles scholde be dyuersliche enformed and itauƷt. 
For wise wyues wol be tauƷt and corrected by faire wordes and plesynge, 
but wyues þat been fooles 
mot be more scharpliche iblamed. 
þanne alle housebondes scholde take heede 
to here owne estaate 
and of condiciouns of persones and schewe to here 
wyues þew tokenes of frendschipe 
and of loue and teche hem 
by þew warnynges and loore. Chapter XXI Kynges and princes and generalliche alle citeseyns scholde wete and iknowe 
how þei scholde araye here wyues. 
For þe housebond scholde rewle þe wif and brynge here 
to honeste workes and vertues, 
it is spedful 
þat alle housebondes take hede wherinne wymmen trespassen comynliche and take heede 
and knowe 
what is laweful and vnlawefulle. 
And for comynliche wymmen desiren most to be holde faire and trespasseth specialiche desyrynge and louynge 
to be gayliche arayed, 
wherfore housebondes 
scholde knowe what aray of wymmen is leeful 
and what araye is vnlefful. 
For wymmen ben neuere vertuous 
but þei forsake and leue vnlefful doyng and, primo Rethoricorum, 
þe philosofer declareth how greet harm falleþ to regne 
and to citee by wymmen 
þat ben not vertuous noþer louen leefful doynge but vnlefful. 
And he spekeþ of þe Lacedemonyes, 
men of þe lond 
þat | hatte Lacedemonia, 
and seith þat þei ben vngracious 
in þe haluendele for þei soffren þeire wyues do vnlufful doyng. 
Þanne for þe hous of a prince oþer of a citeseyn scholde not be vngracious 
in þe haluendele noþer in oþer wyse, 
princes and citeseyns scholde rewle here 
wyues in araye 
and chaste hem 
in alle doyng 
in þe whiche wymmen trespassen ofte. 
Þanne it is to wetynge 
as it longeþ herto þat wymmen araye stondeþ in tweyne, 
for som araye is ifeyned 
and som is verrey in dede. And feynyng araye is smeryng oþer bawmyng 
wiþ white colour oþer wiþ rede by þe whiche feynyng wymmen semen more whit oþer more rody [oþer] in sum wyse more faire þan þei ben in dede. 
And for suche araye is ifeyned, 
it is vnleufful and forbode. 
Þe oþer araye is not ifeyned 
but it stondeþ in þewe ornamentes of araye and Ʒif wymmen ben þerwyþ arayed semelich 
as here astaat axeth þanne 
it is lefful and honest. 
And housebondes scholde araye here wyues as here astaat axen in cloþyng 
and oþere omamentes. 
Þerfore Valerius Maximus preyseþ þe Romayns for þei arayen here wyues in fayre clothynge 
and in oþere ornamentes. 
Þanne so it scholde be of ornament and araye. 
But for to teche wyues more specialliche 
how þei scholde be arayed 
in cloþynge 
and in oþere omamentes, 
it is to wetynge 
þat in cloþynge wymmen may trespace in twey wise: 
first, in takynge more þanne inow, 
þe seconde by lacke and defaute. 
For to putte of more þan inowƷ it | 
nedeþ to haue þre vertues 
þe whiche ben itouched by Andronycus Peripateticus in his book 
þat he makeþ of vertues. 
And þis þre vertues ben icleped humilitas, moderancia and symplicitas: mekenesse, moderatnesse and semplenesse. 
And wymmen ben meke in araie 
whanne þei arayen hemself semliche and wel 
and not for prude and veyn glorie 
but for to plese here housebondes 
and for to wiþdrawe hem fro fornicacioun. 
And þei ben moderate 
whan þei taken heede 
to here owne astaat and axeth not to greet araye. 
For a knygtes wif scholde be betere arayed 
þanne a symple citeseynes wif 
and a kynges wif oþer a princes 
wif scholde be better arayed þanne oþere symplere wyues. 
Also Ʒif eny mannes 
wif were meke and arayed not for veyn glorye, 
Ʒit he myƷt trespase in araye 
Ʒif schue were not moderat 
but arayed passyng here owne astaat. 
Þe þridde, 
wymmen scholde be symple in araye so 
þat þei scholde not be to besy 
to haue greet araye. 
For þeiƷ a womman be not arayed for veyne glorie noþer passynge here owne estaat, 
Ʒut sche may trespasse 
Ʒif sche is to besy 
aboute here owne array. 
Þanne in þre manere wise 
may be superfluyte of aray. 
In tweyne may be trespace, 
wherfore, 
in defaute and lacke. First, Ʒif it is for sleuthe and necligence, 
for sum wymmen ben so slowe and reccheles 
þat onliche for necgligence 
þey leeuen to araye hemself 
as þei scholde. 
Þe seconde, 
in suche defaute is trespas Ʒif wymmen wenen to be preysed 
for suche lacke and defaute. 
For som tyme som man 
is prout of wrecchednesse 
þat he suffreþ. | 
For as it fareth in lame men and seeke 
þat ben at cherche dores, 
comynliche he þat is most lame 
oþer sike is best apaied; 
for he troweth þat most men wol loke on hym and hopeth 
to haue most almesse and Ʒiftes. 
So sum tyme he þat is worst arayed 
in cloþynge is most prout for þei trowen 
to be preysed þerfore. 
Þanne wymmen trespassen Ʒif þei ben proute of euel araye 
and defaute of cloþynge. 
Þerfore, iiii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer blameþ 
þe Lathanies suche men for þei were cloþed worst 
þan here astaat axede 
and were stoute 
and proute þerfore. 
Þanne wyues scholde be so reweled in araye so 
þat þei be besiliche itauƷt 
to knowe þe sixe þat ben itouched. 
For firste, 
þei scholde be iwamed and icharged 
to vse no feyned araye. 
Þe seconde, 
to be humyle and meke 
þat þei be not passynglich arayed for euel noþer for veyn glorye. 
Þe þridde, 
þat þey ben moderat 
þat þey be not arayed passyng here owne astaat. 
Þe ferþe, 
þat þei ben symple 
and not trauele 
to besiliche aboute here awne aray. 
Þe fifþe, 
þat þey be not necligent noþer notabliche for slouthe arayed worse 
þan here astaat axeth. 
Þe sixte, 
þat þei ben not prout neiþer desire 
to be preysed for euel 
and for wrecchede araye 
and for defaute of clothing. Chapter XXII 
Manye men trespassen for þei 
ben to gelous of here wyues. 
And þat to grete gelosie 
is not to preysyng 
may be preued by þre menes. 
For whanne a man 
is to gelous of his wif, 
for greet gelousye he supposeth and troweth of his wif 
alwey þe worst. 
For ofte good wyues and trewe ben iblamed of | here housebondes Ʒif þe housebondes ben to gelous, 
for ofte of good dedes gelouse men supposen þe worste. 
Of to greet gelousie comeþ 
þre harmes by þe whiche þre resons may be take 
by þe whiche it may be preued 
þat to gelous men 
ben not to preysyng. First, 
for þei ben trauaylled 
and disturbled in hemself. 
Þe seconde, 
for þerfore wyues ben excited to do amys. 
Þe þridde, 
for comonliche of suche gelousi comeþ strif 
and wreche in hous. 
Þe firste mene is declared in þis wise. 
For Ʒif housebondes ben to gelous of here owne wyues 
[as Ʒif þei] 
ben alwey suspecte to þe housebondes, 
and so alwey housebondes 
and wyues ben in angwysch and wo of herte, 
and for on besynesse 
letteþ anoþer, 
þei þat ben so gelous ben wiþdrawe 
fro þew besynesse 
and civel workes and dedes. 
Þanne non citeseyns schulde be ielouse ofhere wyues. 
And [þis] is more semelich for kynges and princes in so moche as more harme may come to þe regne [i]f kynges ben in angwysch 
and wo of hert 
and ben wiþdrawe 
fro cyuel doynges 
and þew besynesse of þe regne. 
Þe seconde mene to preue þe same is itake 
for þerby wyues ben excited to do amys Ʒif here housebondes ben to gelous. 
For comonliche and alwey 
forbedyng makeþ 
lust and likyng þe more; 
for as it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
lust and likyng is to þyng þat is not ihad. 
Þerfore it is ipreued 
þere þat oolde men desiren more to lyue þe laste day þan al þe dayes tofore honde, 
for þanne þei hauen more lakke of lif. 
Þan alwey þyng 
þat lackeþ and failleþ 
is þe more desired. 
But whanne a thing is forbode, 
for it is forbode, 
it semeþ 
þat it lackeþ and failleþ 
and is 
þer|fore þe more desired. 
Þanne it folweth 
þat gelous men wyues ben more excited 
to do amys 
þan oþere men wyues, 
for here lust and desire 
is þe more by cause of þe inordynate gelousie of þe housebondes 
and of here inordenate forbedyng. 
Þe þridde mene is itake 
by wrake and stryf 
þat is in hous for gelousye. 
For whan wyues seen 
þat þei ben ichydde and iblamed giltles 
and þat here housebondes 
hauen euel suspecioun of hem withoute cause, 
þanne þe wyues may not pacientliche soffre þe wronge 
þat here gelous housebondes 
beren hem an honde. 
Þerfore comynliche in þat hous is chydyng and strif. 
Þanne it is nouƷt semeliche 
þat housebondes 
be to gelous of here wyues. 
Noþer it is semeliche 
þat wyues haue ward and kepyng ordeyned by þe housebondes. 
Noþer it is semelich 
þat housebondes ben gelous, 
but þei schulde take heede of condiciouns of persones 
and of vsage and manere of þe contray, 
and eche housebonde schal be þeweliche besy 
and redyliche rewle his owne wif. 
And so it is semelich 
þat eche housebonde loue ordinatliche his own wif so 
þat bytwene hem be kynde frendschipe and loue likynge and honest. Chapter XXIII Wymmen counsaile is feble 
as it is iseid, primo Poleticorum. 
For as a child haþ vnparfitƷ counsaille 
for he faileth of perfeccioun of man, 
so a womman haþ feble counsaile 
for þei ben feble of complexioun 
and faillen of þe strengþe of man. 
And þeiƷ sum wymmen ben houge of body and strong þat is not for good complexioun 
but for nesch flesch and tendre. 
For wymmen nesch flesch and tendre 
is more euydens of | moche flewme þanne of good compleccioun. 
Wherfore it is so, 
wymmen mote faille of þe vse of resoun 
and haue feble counsaille. 
For þe beter complexioun 
is in þe body, 
þe more þe body is proporcionate 
to þe soule and serueþ 
þerfore þe soule þe bettre. 
And þe soule þat ━is┐ ━in suche┐ a body vseth his owne workes 
þe more freliche and haþ vse of resoun 
þe more spedliche. 
Þanne first, 
it is to wetyng þat wymmen counsaille is feble. 
Þe seconde, it is to wetynge 
þat wymmen counsaile 
is swift and sone iƷeue. 
For as þe philosofer seith, 
in libro De Animalibus, 
al þat is vnparfit comeþ sone to complement. 
[Þanne wymmen counsaile, 
for it is feblere 
þan mannes counsaile, 
comeþ sone to 
complement.] 
Þanne Ʒif oþere thinges stondeþ euene, 
Ʒif a man scholde anoon do a dede 
and myƷt nouƷt haue ful avisement to do þat dede, 
wymmen counsaille 
were betere þanne men counsaile. 
For kynde is imeued by angels 
and by God 
in wham is most prudencia and wisedom, 
kynde moot wyrche ordinatliche and redyliche for he 
þat is prudens, wise, 
and redy spedeþ 
hym sone and taryeth not moche 
in foule thynges of þe whiche is litel forse. 
Þerfore it is iseid 
in a prouerbe þat an euel herbe groweþ swythe sone, 
for kynde reccheþ luyte þerof 
and bryngeþ it sone to fol wexinge. 
And so a womman haþ rather perfeccioun of body 
þan a man. 
Wherfore by cause þat þe soule 
folweþ þe complexioun of þe body, 
so a womman bodi, 
for it is more vile 
and kynde reccheþ lasse þerof, 
comeþ sonnere to complement þanne mannes body. And so womman counsaile is sonnere parfit 
and ful iƷeue þanne mannes counsaile. 
| Þanne sympelliche withoute condicioun menne counsaille 
is betere þanne wymmen counsaille 
for men ben more parfit 
þanne wymmen and wymmen counsaile is feble. 
But in caas wymmen consaile 
is bettere þanne menne counsaile, 
for it is sonnere iƷeue at fulle. 
Ʒif it nedeþ to do 
in som hasty nede wiþoute longe tyme of avisement, 
on caas wymmen counsaille is best. Chapter XXIV 
By þre menes we may preue 
þat comynliche wymmen 
may not hele consaille. 
Þe firste mene is itake 
by defaute of resoun; 
þe secounde, 
by nesche herte; 
þe þridde, 
by desire of preysyng. 
Þe firste mene is declared in þis wise. 
For as it is iseide tofore, 
Ʒif a dede is forbode, 
here desire is þe more 
to do suche a dede. 
And whanne a þyng 
is itold in consaile, 
it is forbode 
þat it not be itold out. 
And be þat forbeding, 
þe appetite and þe desire is more ex[c]ite to telle 
on cas out counsayle 
þanne oþer þingis. 
But þe appetit and desire be refrainid bi resun, 
wommen mowe not conabliche hold counsayle. Þanne for wymmen lacken vse of resoun and mowe 
not refrayne appetite and desire as men mowe, 
a‡ tellen þerfore sonere þan men and discoueren counsaile. 
For forbedyng makeþ appetite and desire þe more, 
and wymmen ben more inclyned þan men to doo amys 
and aƷenst forbedyng for þei hauen more defaute of reson þan men and mow worse refrayne þyng 
þat exciteþ appetite and desire þanne men mowe. 
Þe seconde mene to preue þe same is itake by nesche herte. 
For comynliche wymmen ben nesche of herte and sone ouercome. 
And whanne a persone preyseþ hem and laugheth on hem, thei trowen 
þat he is a frend and telleþ hym al þe preue|te of here herte. 
Þe þridde mene to preue 
þe same is itake 
by desire of preysynge. 
For it is iseid tofore 
þat comynliche wymmen desiren to be preysed; 
and þerfore comynliche wymmen tellen al here counsaille 
to oþere wymmen 
þe whiche þei holden here frendschipe, 
and trowen þerby to be excellent 
and ipreysed of oþere wymmen 
Ʒif þei tellen to hem 
þe counsaille of here housebondes. 
For it semeþ þat here housebondes louen hem 
Ʒif þei knowen here counsaille. 
And suche wyues hauen veyn glorie to be preysed. 
And so it is declared how men scholde telle here counsaylle to here owne wyues. 
And whanne we tellen whiche ben þe maners 
of children and of olde men, 
it schal not be vnderstonde 
þat children and olde men 
mot nede vse suche maneres, 
but onliche þat comynliche manye vsen maners 
by a manere inclinacioun. 
But children, 
oolde men and wymmen mowe, 
Ʒif þei wollen, 
by vse of resoun ‡, 
be stedefast and constant 
and ouercome suche inclinacioun. 
For þei it be hard to ouercome inclynacioun of appetite and desire, 
and þeiƷ it be more hard in wymmen þan in men for þey ben more defaute of vse of resoun, 
naþelees it is not inpossible. 
For boþe men and wymmen mowe 
ouercome suche reses and inclinaciouns. 
Wherfore þei comynliche wymmen telle out counsaille, 
Ʒut it is not inconuenient 
þei sum wymmen holde wel counsaile. 
Þanne men scholde not telle here counsaille 
to here owne wyues but þei knowe 
by assaye of longe tyme 
þat here wyues ben preuey, wise and redy, 
stedefast and stable and þat þei | wol not wrye and telle out preuey counsaille. 
For þes ben iknowe whanne it is declared how þe comyntee of housebonde 
and wyf is kyndelich 
and how it is iordeyned 
to oþere comyntees of hous, 
and for it is declared 
how kynges and princes and generaliche alle citeseyns scholde haue hemself 
to here owne wyues 
and what maner conuersacioun 
þei scholde haue 
with here owne wifes, 
þe ende is imaad of þe firste part of þe secunde book 
in þe which partie it is itreted of rewelynge and of wedloc. 
But oon caas som man wolde wene 
þat it is not itreted 
at þe folle of rewlyng of wedloc 
for it is not declared to whaat workes wyues ben iordeyned, 
for it is vnsemelich 
þat wyues ben idel 
as it is iseid tofore honde, 
þanne workes þat wyues schulde vse schulde be discreued. 
But þerof we schal speke here after; 
þerfore here me passeþ wiþ scilence. Book II Part II DOI: 10.4324/9781315861739-97 
That fadere and moder scholde be besy aboute here owne children. 
That it is most semelich 
þat kynges and princes be besy 
aboute here owne children 
it is preued in þre manere wise. 
The rewelyng of children comeþ of loue and children scholde be oþer wyse irewled þan seruantes. 
Loue þat scholde be bytwene fader and sone preueþ 
atte folle 
þat fadres scholde rewle here children and children 
scholde be obedient to þe faders. 
Alle citeseyns and namlich kynges and princes scholde be besy 
to ío rewle here children 
þat þey cunne here byleue in childhod. 
Alle citeseyns and namelich kynges and princes scholde be besy to rewle here children 
þat þei be itaugt 
to vse good maners in childhod. 
Gentile menes children and namliche children 
of kyngis and princes scholde in childhode be sette to scole to liberal and free loore. 
Whaat science children of gentel men, of kynges, and princes scholde lerne. 
What maner maister scholde teche children of gentil men and namliche of kynges and princes. 
How children scholde be tauƷt in speche, in siƷt, and hiryng. 
In how manye wise is trespas in mete 
and how children scholde haue hemself in mete. 
How children scholde be tauƷt 
to haue hemself in drynkynge, in mariage, 
and in cloþynge. 
How children scholde haue hemself 
in beryng in pleyges. 
In Ʒong age it is good to be waar of euel companye. 
In whaat wise children scholde be rewled and ikepte fro þat þei ben first ibore forto þey ben seuene Ʒere olde. 
In what wise children scholde be irewled 
and ikepte fro seuen Ʒere to fourtene Ʒere. 
In what wise children scholde be irewled and ikepte fro þe fourtene Ʒere 
and so forþ. 
Not alle children schulde vse ileche moche trauaille and bodiliche besynesse. 
DouƷters of cyteseyns and namelich of gentil men, 
of kynges and of | princes 
scholde be wiþdrawe 
fro strayinge and lewed walkynge aboute. 
How alle citeseyns and nameliche kynges and princes scholde be besy to rewle here 
douƷtres þat þei ben not idel. 
Kynges and princes and generalliche alle citeseyns scholde teche here 
douƷtres to be softe and stille 
and not vse grete iangelyng. Chapter I 
For þe firste partie of þis seconde book 
is isped in þe whiche partie 
it is itreted of þe rewlyng of wedloc, 
now it is to wetyng of þe seconde partie 
in þe whiche it schal be treted of rewlyng of children. 
For it is not inow 
to an housebonde 
to cunne rewle his wif 
but he kunne also gouerne and rewle his children ariƷt. 
Þanne it is to wetyng 
þat comynte of housebonde and wif, 
of lord and seruaunt, 
longeþ to þe firste hous 
and comynte of fader and sone longeþ to a parfit hous. 
Þerfore on caas 
som man wolde wene 
þat anon 
after tretynge of rewlyng of wedloc 
it were to tretyng of rewlyng of seruantes. 
But as þe philosofer seith, primo Poleticorum, 
an housebonde is more besy aboute men 
þanne aboute sowles possessioun 
and aboute his children 
[þ]an aboute his seruantes. 
Þerfore we wolde raþer trete of rewlyng of children þanne rewlyng of seruauntes, 
for in rewelyng of children scholde be more charge and besynesse 
þanne in rewelyng of seruantes. 
And in tretyng of rewelyng of children 
we wol first declare þat alle fadres scholde be besy aboute here owne children. 
Ʒif þe besynesse is iknowe 
þat scholde be aboute children, 
þe fadres ben þe more excited 
to rewle wel | here children. 
And by þre menes we may preue 
þat fadres 
and modres schulde haue suche besynesse. 
Þe f[irst]e mene is itake for fadres ben cause of þe children 
and children comen and hauen beyng of þe fadres. Þe seconde, 
for þe fadres ben aboue þe children 
and kunneþ more good þanne þei. 
And þe þridde, 
for bytwene fadres and children 
scholde be kynde frendschipe and loue. 
Þe firste mene is declared in þis wise. 
For as we seen in kyndelich thinges 
þat kynde Ʒeueþ neuere beyng to a thing 
but kynde be busy aboute thinges 
by þe whiche þat þyng may be kepte 
and isaued in beynge, 
as ━Ʒif‐ [kynde] ┐Ʒu‡eth┐ ‡ beynge to fuyre, 
anon kynde is besy to Ʒeue þerto liötnesse 
by þe whiche it may be bore vpward, 
[for] fuyre is better ikepte and isaued aboue þanne byneþe: 
and so whan kynde Ʒeueþ beyng to beestes, 
for a beeste may not be saued wiþoute mete, 
anoon kynde is besy to Ʒeue mowþes to beestes and oþere lymes 
by þe whiche þei mowe take mete and norischyng. 
Þanne for þe fadres ben cause of þe children 
and þe children 
hauen kyndelich beyng of þe fadres, 
þe fadres scholde haue charge of þe children 
and be besy aboute hem 
to fynde hem 
liflode and thinges 
þat hem neden to kepe and saue hem in beynge. 
Þe seconde mene to preue þe same is itake for þe fadres ben aboue þe children 
and kunneþ more good þan þey. 
For alwey by kynde 
o[u]ere thinges Ʒeuen influence and vertue to þe [ne]þer and rewleþ and saueþ hem. 
And we seen þat sterres and planettes of heuene Ʒeueþ influence 
and vertue | to þese 
neþer <thinges> 
and rewleth and saueth hem. 
Þanne for it is kyndeliche 
þat þe ouere thinges Ʒeue influence and vertue to þe nethere 
and rewle hem and saue, 
eche lord and souereyn scholde be besy how þey scholde þewliche helpe 
and sokere his sogettes 
and rewle hem and saue. 
And so God hymself þat is aboue al haþ besynesse, prudencia, wisdom and rewlynge of al þe world. 
Þanne for þe fadres ben kyndelich aboue þe children, 
þei scholde be besy aboute here rewlyng. 
Þe þridde mene is itake 
by kynde frendschipe and loue 
þat is bytwene fadres and children. 
For by resoun of loue he þat louen scholde be besy aboute þyng 
þat he loueþ, 
for eche man is besy aboute hym þat he loueth. 
Þanne for bytwene fader and sone is kynde loue 
as it is ipreued, 
viii Ethicorum, 
by cause of kynde loue 
þat is bytwene fadres and children, fadres schulde be besy aboute here children. Chapter II 
They alle fadres scholde be besy aboute here owne children 
as it is ipreued 
by þe forseide resons, 
Ʒit it is most semelich 
þat kynges and princes haue suche besynesse 
and þat we may preue by þre menes: 
þe firste is itake 
by wit and kunnyng of hem; 
þe seconde, 
by goodnesse of þe children; 
þe þridde, 
by profit of þe regne. 
Þe firste mene is declared in þis wise. 
For in libro De Animalibus 
þe philosofer seith þat of beestes 
þat what is best iknowe haþ most besynesse, 
and he þat knoweþ best is most besy | aboute his children; 
for it is kyndelich 
þat eche loue his owne workes 
as þe philosofer meneþ [in] Ethic[is]. 
Þerfore þe fadres louen kyndeliche here owne children and poetes 
louen here owne poesees 
as here owne werkes. 
Þanne þe more cunnynge and wytty oon is and þe better he knoweþ his owne werk, 
þe more besy a is 
þeraboute he loueþ it þe bettre. 
Þanne þe more kunnynge and wise þe fadres ben, 
þe more besy he scholde be aboute here owne children. 
But it is ipreued 
þat kynges and princes and generalliche alle lordes 
mot be redy, cunnyng, and wise Ʒif 
þei scholde be lordes by kynde. 
Þanne þe more witty, wise, 
and redy þei ben, 
þe kynges and princes scholde be more besy 
aboute here owne children 
passynge oþere men. 
Þe seconde mene 
is itake by goodnesse of children. 
For children of kynges and princes scholde be bettre and more good 
þan oþere children 
as þe philosofer meneþ, 
iii Polethicorum, 
and seith þat as men ben 
in grettere staat 
and in more dignite, 
so he scholde be þe more good and þe more parfit in cunnyng and in vertues. 
For who þat rewleth oþere ‡ men scholde be wise 
so and redy and so good 
þat oþere men myƷte take of hem 
ensample of leuyng. 
And þeiƷ not al children of kynges and princes 
be kynges and princes, 
Ʒit for thei ben al in som principate 
and in som lordschipe 
in the whiche hee mot rewle oþere men, 
he scholde be wise and redy and good. 
But for children ben þe bettre and þe more wise, 
redy and good Ʒif þe fadres ben besy aboute hem, 
þe more wise and redy and good heere children scholde | ‡ be, 
kynges and princes scholde be 
þe more besy aboute here owne children. 
Þe þridde mene to preue þe same is itake 
by profit of þe regne. 
For goodnesse of þe regne 
is dependant of þe goodnesse of hem 
þat ben in þe regne 
and namliche of goodnesse of princes 
þat ben þerinne. 
For as hele of kyndelich body 
is dependant of heele of al þe membris, 
and namliche of heele of þe herte 
and of þe principal membris 
for þe herte and principaliche membris 
Ʒeuen influence and vertue to oþere membris and rewleþ hem, 
so goodnesse of þe regne 
is dependant of goodnesse 
of alle citeseyns 
and nameliche of goodnesse of princes and lordes 
þat ben in þe regne. 
It is profit to eche regne 
to haue good citeseyns, 
but it is more profit to haue good princes, 
for princes scholde rewle oþere men. 
Þanne þe more profit comeþ 
to þe regne 
of goodnesse of children of kynges 
þat scholde haue principate and lordschipe 
in þe regne passynge þe profit 
þat comeþ of goodnesse 
and of wit and wisdome of oþere children, 
þe more semelich it is 
þat kynges and princes be besy aboute here owne children 
to make hem wise and redy and good. Chapter III 
For after þe tretes of rewelyng of wedloc 
it is to tretyng of rewelyng of children, 
it is to wetyng wherof þe ordre 
and rewelyng of children springeþ 
and by what reweling children scholde be rewled. 
Þanne it is to wetyng 
þat þer is þre manere of rewlyng for eche man 
þat rewleþ oþere men: 
| oþer a rewleþ hem 
by certeyn lawes and couenantes, 
and suche rewelyng 
is icleped politicum oþer cyuel, 
as it is iseid tofore; oþer he rewleþ hym freliche 
by his owne wille, 
and þat may be in twey maner wise. 
For he þat rewleth so doþ it ‡ for his owne profit, 
and þanne þe rewlyng 
is icleped regymen despoticum oþer ceruyle; 
oþer he þat rewleth doþ 
it for profit of þe sogettes, 
and suche rewelyng 
is icleped regale, real, 
þat is a real kyngdome. 
And to þes þre manere of rewlyng 
by þe whiche we seen men 
rewle citees, casteles, and townes ben ilikned þre maners of rewlyng 
þat ben in oon hous. 
For þe rewlyng of wedloc 
is ilikned to þe rewelyng 
þat hatte poleticum, 
for as it is iseid tofore a man schal not be aboue his wif rewelyng 
by his owne lust and likynge 
but as þe lawes of wedloc axeth 
and þewe couenantes 
þat ben imaad 
bytwene housebonde and wif. 
And þe rewelynge of children 
is ilikned to þe rewelyng real, 
for þe fader is aboue þe children 
not by couenantes and foreward 
but by his fre wille. 
For bytwene þe sogette 
and þe souereyne 
is no couenant imaad 
but þe sogette may chese hym a souereyne, 
so bytwene þe fader 
and þe children is non couenant imaad 
but þe children myƷt chese hem a fader. 
But þe children comen kyndeliche of fader 
and of moder 
and chesen not a fader 
as wyues chesen housebondes. 
Þanne for rew-yng of children 
is by fre | wil of þe fader 
and for here owne good and profit, 
suche rewelyng is not ilekned 
to þe rewlyng 
þat hatte poleticum 
but to þe rewelyng real. 
And primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seiþ 
þat þe housebonde 
is aboue þe wif 
and þe children, 
aboue hem þat ben free, 
and not in þe same manere of principate; 
but he is aboue þe wif by politik rewelyng, 
and aboue þe children 
by real rewlyng. 
And þe þridde rewelyng 
þat is in an hous 
by þe whiche rewlyng 
manye is irewled 
is ilikned to þe rewlyng 
þat hatte dominatiuum, 
lordlich rewelyng. 
Now þis is declared it semeþ 
þat it is ful sooþ 
þat was iseid 
in þe bygynnyng of þe chapitre. 
For Ʒif þe fader scholde be aboue children realiche 
and for here owne good and profite, 
for it is al oon to loue a man 
and to wille hym good, 
þe fader scholde be aboue þe children 
for here owne good and profit and for he wol hem good. 
Þanne it is iknowe clerliche 
þat suche rewlyng comeþ of loue. 
Þanne it is opounliche declared 
þat children and seruantes 
scholde not be rewled 
by on manere rewlyng, 
for a lord is aboue his seruantes 
for his owne good and profit. 
And þe philosofer meneþ 
þat it is al on to be aboue oþere 
as aboue his seruantes 
for his owne good and profit 
and not for here good and profit, 
but þe fadir schuld be aboue is childrin 
for here good and profite. 
Þanne by þe distyncioun of maners of rewlyng it is declared þat rewlyng of children 
and of seruantes 
is not al oon 
but þe rewlynge of children cometh of loue; 
and for to speke more clerlich we may preue be twey weyes 
þat rewlyng of children cometh of loue. 
Þe firste wey is itake 
[by ordre of kynde; 
þe seconde by perfeccioun of þe fader. 
Þe firste mene is declared] 
in þis | wyse. 
For þe philosofer meneþ 
þat kynde Ʒeueþ þe vertue of generacioun for thinges 
þat may not be perpetual in hemself scholde be perpetual 
in som thinges ileche þerto. 
Wherfore Ʒif rewlyng of children comeþ of loue and for þe child 
is kyndelyche a certeyne liknesse and comeþ of þe fader, 
for by kynde þynges 
þat ben iliche loueþ eche oþer, 
we may argue by kynde ordre 
þat rewlyng of children 
is igrounded in loue and comeþ of loue. 
For as in alle thinges 
is kynde inclinacioun 
to gendre 
and brynge forþ suche anoþer 
and to gendre and to gete children, 
so in hem is kynde inclinacioun 
to loue here children 
and to rewle hem 
and to be besy aboute hem. 
Þanne kynde ordre is so 
þat rewlyng and besynesse aboute children 
comeþ of loue. Þe seconde wey to preue 
þe same is itake by perfeccioun of þe fader. 
For þe philosofer meneþ 
þat eche thing is parfit 
whanne it may gendre 
and brynge forþ suche anoþer. 
Þanne for eche man loueþ 
kyndelich his owne perfeccioun, 
þe fader loueþ 
kyndelich his childe for þe child 
is as þei it were witnesse of þe faders perfeccioun. 
Þanne for þe fader haþ 
kynde loue to his child, 
he is excited by loue 
to rewle þe child; 
and it were not so 
but rewlyng of children comeþ of loue. 
It is iknow 
þat rewlyng of children comeþ of loue and þat þe fader scholde be aboue þe children 
for here owne good and profit, 
and þat rewlyng of children comeþ of loue and he þat loueþ 
is alwey besy aboute þe persone 
þat he loueþ 
and for his profit. 
Þanne children and seruantes 
scholde not be rewled 
by oon manere rewlyng, 
for he þat [rewleþ hem] 
is aboue | his seruantes, 
for þei ben seruantes 
þat desiren his owne good and profit. 
And Ʒif it happeþ 
þat a man vseþ his children as seruantes, 
þat is for inperfeccioun of his hous; 
for on caas he is so pore þat he may not haue seruantes inow. 
Þerfore, vi Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seiþ 
þat nedy men mote vse here 
wyues and children 
in stede of seruantes. Chapter IV 
It was iseid in þe nexte chapitre 
þat rewlyng of children comeþ of loue. 
Þanne it is to wetynge 
how moche fadres louen 
þe children and children þe fadres 
þat we may knowe how fadres scholde rewle here children 
and children be obedient toþe fadres. 
viii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat we may preue 
by þre resons 
þat fadres and modres louen here children more þan agenward. 
Þe firste resoun is itake 
by lengthe of time. 
Þe ii, 
bi swirte and sikirnesse of childrin. 
Þe iii, 
bi onyng of fadris 
and modris to þe childryn. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For þe lengere loue dureþ, 
þe strengere it is; 
and faders and moders loueþ 
þe children lengere tyme þan children louen fadres and modres, 
for anon as children ben ibore fadres and moders louen hem. 
And children louen not fadres and modres anoon as þei ben ibore, 
for þei ben not so wise 
þat þey knowen what is to louynge bot for children anoon as þey ben ibore 
kunneþ not knowe 
bytwene fader and moder and oþer men and wymmen 
þat loueþ hem not anoon. 
But by passyng of tyme, 
whanne þey knowen betwene fader and moder and oþere, 
þanne he bygynneþ to loue hem. 
Þanne faderes and moders 
louen þe children long |gere tyme þan agenward 
wherfore þe loue is þe more strong. 
Þe seconde reson to preue þe same is itake 
by sikernesse and suerte of þe children. 
For fadres and modres ben more siker and certeyn of here child 
þan þe child 
of his fader and moder. 
For þe child may not be certefyed 
who is fader and moder 
but [by] sum signes and tokenes, 
by sight oþer by huyryng, 
as a child seeþ 
þat som persones louen hym more þan oþere doun 
þei arguen þerby 
þat ben his fader and moder. 
But in þis firste burþe 
he is not so wis 
þat he can not iknowe 
of what fader and moder he came. 
But fader and moder knowen anoon 
and ben certeyn of here child 
and ben þerfore more certeyne of þe child 
þanne agenward. 
Þerfore þey louen hym more þanne aƷenward; 
for ÞeyƷ Þer be kynde loue 
bytwene fader and moder and children, 
Ʒit þe more certeyne fader and moder ben of here child, 
þe more þey louen hym. 
And by þe same resoun we may preue 
þat modres louen here children 
more þan fadres doon 
for þey ben more certeyn of hem. 
Þe þridde resoun to preue 
þe same is itake 
by onynge of fadres 
and modres to þe children. 
For þe children ben more neer and ioned 
to fadres and moders þan aƷenward. 
Þanne for loue is a manere onyng, 
þe children as more ioned and neer to þe fadres and modres þan agenward 
ben more iloued of fadre and moders aƷenward. 
For we imagenen þat children 
ben as it were certeyn parties of fadres and modres, 
for a child is a certeyne partee departed 
fro fader and moder. 
And a partee is more ioned to þe hoole 
for it is conteyned þerinne, 
þanne þe hool is ioned to | 
þe partie 
for it 
may not be conteyned þerinne. 
For in þe hoole 
is a partie wel feer 
fro anoþer partie 
and in þe partie 
is no thing fer 
fro þe hoole. 
Wherfore Ʒif a partie 
is meued to loue al þe hoole, 
Ʒut it loueþ not þe hoole so strongliche; 
for in þe hoole is som what þat is wel fer 
fro þat partye. 
But Ʒif þe hoole is meued 
to loue þe partee þerof, 
it loueþ þat partee ful stronglich 
for no þyng is in þe partie 
þat is not in þe hoole. 
Þanne þe child 
þat is as it were a gobet 
and a partie comyng of fader and moder; 
and for it is a certeyne partie of hem, 
al þat is in þe childe 
is nyƷ to fader and moder. 
But children ben not so strongliche imeued to loue fader and moder, 
[for þat longeþ to fader and moder] 
longeþ not in þat wise to þe children; 
and so þei ben not so ioned to þe children 
as children be ioned 
to fader and moder. 
By þis menynge of þe philosofer 
we may argue 
at þe fulle 
þat fader and moder 
scholde be besy to rewle þe children, 
for eche scholde be besie aboute hem 
þat he loueþ strongliche. 
And children scholde be obedyent 
to fader and moder 
for eche scholde be obedient to hem 
þat þey knowen 
þat hym louen strongliche 
and desiren not but his owne good and profit. 
Þanne in þis wise 
by þe philosofer menes we may preue þynges 
þat were iseid 
in þe bygynnyng of þe chapitre. 
But for to declare þe menynge more specialliche, 
it is to wetynge 
þat þei[Ʒl fader and moder 
loue more þe children 
and wolle hem more good þanne aƷenward, 
Ʒut it is not inconuenient touchynge 
som manere good þeiƷ children 
loue fader and moder more þan aƷenward. 
For as it is iseid, 
octauo Ethicorum, 
fader and moder loueþ þe children 
a[s] | 
som what of here owne, 
and children louen fader and moder for þei comen of hem. 
And þe loue þat fader and moder hauen to þe children comeþ 
fro þe worcher to þe werk 
and from þe ouer to þe neþer; 
and þe loue þat þe child hauen to þe fader and moder comeþ 
from þe work to þe worchere 
and from þe neþer to þe ouer. 
And f[or] þe ouer Ʒeueth influence 
and vertue to þe neþer 
and kepeþ 
and saueþ hem and not aƷenward, 
þerfore fader and moder louen kyndely þe children for to Ʒeue hem influence and vertue for to gedre for hem gode possessions and money by þe whiche þey mowe lyue and lede here lif. 
Þanne fader and moder gaderen for þe children, 
and not aƷenward, 
but whanne þe children mowe, 
[þei] briben and stelen þe good 
and catel of here fader and moder. 
And þe neþer doun reuerence 
and ben suget to þe ouere 
and þerfore children doun more kyndelich reuerence 
and worschep 
to fader and moder þan aƷenward. 
And Ʒif me axeth 
where fader and moder louen þe children more þan aƷenward, 
for it is al oon to loue a persone 
and to wille hym good, 
it is to distyngwyng of good. 
For Ʒif þow spekest of profitable good 
as of moneye and oþer good 
þat is iordeyned for to lyue by, 
so fader and moder loueþ þe children more þanne aƷenward 
for fader and moder 
gadren suche good for here children and children 
not for fader and moder. 
But Ʒif þou spekest of good 
þat is honour and worschepe, 
so þe children loueþ 
þe fader and moder more þan aƷenward. 
For fader and moder may bettre suffre huyre speke euel of children þanne aƷenward, 
for it is kyndeliche 
þat children 
mowe not huyre speke euel of fader and moder. 
For fader and moder hauen not so greet indignacioun 
to huyre despise here children as aƷenward. 
It is declared what manere loue 
is bytwene fader and moder and children, 
for fader and moder louen þe | children 
and gederen good and catel for hem. 
For þei þat gederen good and catel for oþere 
and ben besy for here 
liflode scholde hem gouerne and rewle, 
for þe loue þat fader and moder 
hauen to children 
þei scholde hem gouerne and rewle. 
But for þe children louen fader and moder as hem 
þat þei wollen honoure and worschep, 
and he þat scholde do honour and worschipe is in som wise soget to hym to þe whiche he wolde honour and worschepe 
as by þe loue 
þat fader and moder hauen to þe children 
þei scholde hem gouerne and rewle, 
so by þe loue 
þat children hauen to fader and moder 
þei scholde be obedient and soget to hem. 
Þanne it is declared 
þat touchynge profitable good fader 
and moder louen þe children more þanne aƷenward. 
But touchynge good þat is honour and worschepe, 
children louen fader and moder more þanne aƷenward. 
But sympliche for to speke, 
fader and moder louen þe children more þan children louen fader and moder, 
for þei ben more besy and careth more 
for profit of here children [þan] children doun for honour and worschep of fader and moder. Chapter V 
Thre schal be rekened 
þat longeþ to þe fey 
by þe whiche we may declare 
by þre menes 
þat alle citeseyns 
and namliche kynges and princes 
scholde besiliche rewle here children 
and teche hem þe fey in here childhood. 
Þe firste, 
for fey is aboue resoun 
and is of thinges 
þat may not be knowe by resoun. 
Þe seconde, 
þe poyntes of þe fey mot be sympliche itrowed. 
Þe þridde, 
þe fey mot be stedfasteliche | trowed. 
Þe first mene is declared in þis wise. 
For þe fey is aboue resoun 
and is of thinges 
þat may not be iknowe by resoun, 
it is good 
þat it be tauƷt 
in þat age in þe whiche no resoun is iaxed 
but what is iseid is itrowed. 
And þat age is childhode; 
for whanne children ben iwarned 
and itaugt by fader and moder 
what þey scholde doo and trowe, 
þei axen non resoun 
whi for þei hauen not þe vse of resoun 
but þei trowen anoon 
whaat þe fader seid oþer þe moder. 
Þe seconde mene to preue 
þe same may be declared in þis wise. 
For þe fei ‡ es of thinges 
þat ben aboue resoun, 
þerfore þey scholde be trowed sympliche. 
For þe poyntes of þe fey scholde be trowed 
by auctorite of Good 
and by symple byleue 
and not by experience and assaye of resoun. 
But þat is not ido inconuenientliche, 
for no man douteþ 
þat þe ordinaunce 
and auctorite of God 
passeth al þe witte of mankynde. 
Wherfore it is bettere 
to trowe sympliche 
þe auctorite of God þan stonde to resons 
and demonstraciouns of mankynde. 
Þanne Ʒif þe poyntes of þe fey 
scholde be sympliche itrowed, 
he scholde be comonlyche itauƷt in þat age 
þat troweth sympliche and sone, 
and þat age is childhood. 
For as we seide in þe firste book 
whanne we treted of maners of children 
þat children trowen sympliche and sone, 
þerfore, ii Ethicorum, 
it is iseyd þat children scholde be itauƷt by þe lawe; 
and þere þe philosofer clepeth techyng 
by þe lawe warnyng and chargyng of þe moder 
and þe lore of þe fey of fader and moder. 
Ʒif in oþer lawes fader and moder be anon besy to teche here children 
þe poyn|tes of here owne fey 
and of here owne lawe for þat age troweþ sympliche and sone, 
moche more Cristene men scholde teche þe children here fey in here childhood. 
For owre lawe passeth 
alle oþere lawes 
and is withoute wemme and wiþoute smyttynge of errours, 
and in oþere lawes falsede 
is imedled wyþ trouthe. 
Þe þridde mene to preue þe same is itake for þe poyntes of þe fey scholde be stedefastliche ytrowed. 
And we seeþ þat vsage is 
as it were anoþer kynde, 
as it is iseid in libro De Memoria et Remeniscencia. 
And þe resoun herof 
is asyned [in] Rethoric[is], 
þere it is iseid 
þat kynde is alwey 
and vsage is ofte 
and what is ofte is nys thing 
þat is alwey. 
Wherfore vsage is nyƷ kynde; 
þanne þe more a þyng is vsed, 
þe more it tomeþ 
in to kynde 
and is þe more feruentliche ihoolde. 
Þanne for we ben more ivsed in þynges 
þat we vsen in childhood 
þan in oþere þynges 
and so we trowen hem more stedfastliche 
and wiþoute eny doute, 
þe poyntes of þe fey scholde be tauƷt vs in childhood. 
Þerfore, ii Methaphisicorum, 
þe philosofer wol preue 
þat vsage is of greet doynge and seiþ in þis wise: 
þou myƷt wete and knowe 
how moche vsage makeþ and doþ, 
takyng hede to þe lawe 
in þe whiche children trowen fables and appolleges, 
falce talis and scorneful, 
þan more treuþeand soþenesse. 
And Ʒif þe lawe ofnacions 
and mysbelyued men conteynen manye fables and appologes, 
many false fables and scomeful, 
and ben itauƷt children in here Ʒouthe for þey scholde be vsed 
þerinne and trowe 
þe poyntes 
þerof stedefastliche, 
þe poyntes of Cristene fey 
þat onlich is riƷtful and vniuersal scholde be tauƷt children | in here Ʒouthe. 
And for it longeþ to clerkes and doctours to knowe distincteliche þe poyntes and articles of þe fey 
and trete sotjeliche þe poyntes 
þerof and teche hem to oþere, 
and lewede men 
and namelich childrin 
mot not haue so 
[so]til knowleche of þe feyþe; 
þerfore it is inow to hem to lerne þe poyntes boystousliche 
and in a certeyne summe so 
þat þei be tauƷt 
þat þer is oon God almyƷty, 
creatour of alle, 
Fader and Sone and Holy Goost; 
and þat oure firste fader Adam synnede and mankynde was infecte by his synne. 
Þerfore to saue vs Goddes sone took flesch and blood ofa mayde 
and was ibore ofhure, 
and suffrede deþ 
for oure synne 
and was iburyed, 
and wente doun in to helle and brouƷte þennes þe goode soules 
þat were þere in presoun, 
and roos fro deeþ 
þe þridde day 
and styghe vp in to heuene 
and sitteþ 
in his fader riƷt hond, 
and schal eft come to þe doom. 
And we alle schal arise 
and stonde tofore hym 
at þe doom 
and geue rekenyng 
of alle oure dedes 
so 
þat þei þat doun wel schal goo in to lif wiþoute ende 
and þei þat doun euel 
in to fuyre wiþoute ende. 
Þanne alle cyteseyns scholde be besy 
þat here children 
lerne þis fey in here childhood. 
And þe more good and profit may come to þe regne and to Cristene religione 
by strong fey of children 
of kynges and of princes 
and þe more peril 
may come 
of here feynt fey, 
þe more besy kynges and princes scholde be þat here children lernede fey in childhood. Chapter VI 
The more noble þe soule 
is passyng þe body, 
þe more besy alle citeseyns and namlich kynges and princes scholde be þat here children 
be more parfit in soule | þanne in body. 
Þanne Ʒif þei ben besy aboute heritage 
and money to helpe here children 
in bodilich nede, 
þei scholde be moche morebesy todo 
þat here children 
be parfit in soule 
and itaugt in vertues and good maners. 
And for þis is so good and profitable 
þat it scholde not be forgenderyng 
but children scholde be taugt in child-hood 
to forsake outrage 
and euel maners 
and to folwe goode þewes and maners. 
And we may preue by foure menes þat children scholde be taugt in childhood 
to vse good maneres. 
Þe firste is itake for likynge 
is as it were kyndeliche; 
þe seconde, 
by defaute of resoun; 
þe þridde, 
by inclynacioun 
þat we hauen to euel; 
þe ferþe, 
by forsakynge of contrarie disposicioun. 
Þe firste mene is declarid in þis wise. 
For, iii Eticorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat it is so kyndelich 
to vs to haue likyng 
þat in childhod we begynnen to haue likyng. 
Þerfore children hauen likyng anon 
whan þei ‡ 
bygennen to souke tetes and breestes. 
Þanne Ʒif likyng wexe so wiþ ows in childhood, in childhood schulde suche likynge be wiþstonde. 
Þerfore by cause of þat kynde likynge, 
anoon as children 
kunneþ speke and vnderstonde 
þei scholde be taugt to vse good maners 
by techyng, chargyng and warnynge. 
Þe seconde mene to preue 
þe same is itake 
by defaute of resoun. 
For þanne þei scholde be most itaugt 
and imeued to good maners 
whanne þei ben most inclyned to yuel maners 
and outrage and moost passionat. 
But as þe philosofer meneþ, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
in gong age men ben most disposed to lecherie 
and to euel maneres 
and passionate and folweþ passions. 
Wherfore þanne it is most need to helpe so 
þat by chargynge and 
war|nyng and þewe coreccions 
þey may be wiþdrawe 
fro lecherie and outrage. 
Þanne for resoun refrayneþ lecherie, outrage and likynge, 
þe more defaute a man 
haþ of resoun 
þe more he is inclyned to folwe passions. 
Þanne in gong age children 
scholde be tauƷt 
to vse good maners, 
for þanne þei ben most defaute of resoun 
and most folwen passions. 
Þe þridde mene 
is itake by inclinacioun 
þat we hauen to euel. 
For whanne a man is inclined to som dede, 
hym nedeþ to vse 
þe contrarie þat he falle not to þat dede. 
For comynliche maners of men ben 
as it were a croked Ʒerde. 
Þerfore þe philosofer seith, 
circa finem, ii Ethicorum, 
þat we scholde rewle vs to good maners 
as a croked Ʒerd 
is irewled to be euene. 
And he þat wol make a croked Ʒerd euene 
he streccheth þe Ʒerd 
and bendeþ 
it bacward to þe contrarie side; 
and þe Ʒerd þat is so ibend turneþ 
anon aƷen to þe mene 
and is streiƷt and euene. 
And so we, 
for we hauen inclinacioun 
to suche crokednesse 
and to euel 
and to vnlaweful likyng, 
we schulde longe tyme absteyne vs fro vnlaweful likynge 
þat we myƷt putte of suche inclinacioun. 
And as a Ʒerd þat scholde be streiƷt and imaad euene 
is ibend passynge 
þe riƷtnesse and euennesse 
toward þe oþer side 
þat it may come aƷen to þe mene and abyde riƷt and euene, 
and so in forsakyng likynge we scholde passe þe mene 
and forsake manye manere likynge, 
and on caas sum laweful likynge 
þat we myƷte þe sonner 
and þe betre absteyne 
fro vnlaweful likynge. 
Þanne Ʒif we hauen so greet 
inclyna|cioun to euel 
þat vs nedeþ 
in þat wise to vse þe contrarie longe tyme 
þat we may putte of þe bettre 
þe inclynacioun to euel 
and be inclined to good, 
we schulde in childhood 
bygynne to forsake lecherie 
and outrage 
and folwe good maners 
and no lenger abyde but bygynne in childhood. 
Þe ferþe mene is itake 
by excitynge of contrarie habite and disposicioun. 
For children ben nesche and sone ouercome, 
Ʒif þei folwen lecherie 
and likyng wiþoute refraynyng, 
anoun vicious habites and disposiciouns ben iprented in hem 
as þe liknes of a seel 
is sone iprented 
in þe nesche wex 
þat is wel itempered. 
Þan þat cheldron ben not vicious, 
anon in childhood 
þey scholde be icharged, iwarned, and itauƷt, 
and ichasted to leue 
and forsake lecherie likynge and outrage. 
Þanne alle citesens scholde be besy 
þat here children be tauƷt in 30uþe to vse goode maneres. 
But þe more goodnesse may come 
to þe regne 
by goodnesse of children of kynges and of princes 
and þe more malice and harme may come of here malice, 
þe more besy kynges and princes scholde be þat here children 
be itauƷt in childhood 
to vse good maneres. Chapter VII TheiƷ it were semelich þat alle men knewe letters 
to be þerby prudent, wise, and redy 
and to be þe more waar of vnlaweful doyng, 
Ʒit it semeþ þat som men hauen skilful excusacioun 
þeiƷ he go not to scole and lerne letters. 
And suche ben pore men 
þat hauen not wherby to libbe and semeþ skilfulliche excused 
þeiƷ he wiþdrawe hem 
fro scole for to gete here liflode. 
But gentel men and noble and namlich kynges and princes 
þat ben riche inow ben gretliche | 
to blamynge Ʒif þey setten not here children 
to scole in childhood. 
And þat lernyng of letters scholde bygynne in childhood 
we may preue by þre menes. 
Þe firste is itake 
by distyncte and redy speche; 
þe seconde, 
by takynge good heed; 
þe þridde, 
by perfeccioun 
þat is in sciens and in kunnynge. 
For þei þat wolle leme lettres schulde kunne speke 
and sowne literal wordes; 
and þei schulde also studie and take heede of þynges 
þat ben itaugt by letters. 
Þe þridde, 
þei scholde doo al here besynesse and myƷt to come 
to perfeccioun of science and of connyng. 
Þe firste mene is declared in þis wise. 
For we seen in comyne longeages of diuerse londes 
þat vnneþe may eny man sowne langage ariƷt 
but he be vsed 
þerto in his childhood. 
And Ʒif a man passeþ 
whan he is of ful age 
in to fer londes 
where þe langages ben dyuerse, 
þouƷ þei ben þere longe tyme vnneþe oþer neuer he may sowne any langage aryƷt. 
But alwey men of þe londe knowen 
þat he is a strongeer 
and not ibore in þat contray. 
Þanne Ʒif it fareth so in langages of lewede men, 
moche more it fareth so in literal langage 
þat is philosofres langage. 
For philosofres seye 
þat no comyne lewed langage was compleet and parfit by þe which þei miƷt parfitlich rekene and speke of kyndes of þynges 
and of maneres of 
me‡n and of cours of þe sterres 
and of oþere thinges 
of þe whiche þei wolde despute, 
þei fonde vp as it were a proper langage 
þat hatte Latyn oþer a literal langage 
so large and copious 
þatþei myƷte þerby schewe and telle out 
al here menynge at þe folle. 
Þanne Ʒif þis langage is so | large and complet 
and we may not sowne oþere langages 
ariƷt but we be vsed þerto in childhood, 
þanne Ʒif we wollen speke Latyn ariƷt and lerne letters, 
we scholde vse lettres in childhod. 
Þe seconde mene to preue þe same is itake by takyng good hede and feruentnesse 
þat scholde be in studie, 
for neuere man studieþ wel 
but he be feruent and take good heede to þe studye. 
Þanne for vsage 
is as it were 
þe oþer kynde, 
for [in] Poletic[is] 
þe philosofer seith þat workes 
þat we vsen in childhood 
plesen vs best for eche man 
is most feruent and takeþ best hede to þyng 
þat pleseth hym best, 
þanne þat we may be feruent and take hede to literal studie, 
we scholde lerne literal lore 
in childhood and þanne we scholde be feruent 
and take good heede þerto. 
Þe þridde mene is itake by perfeccioun 
þat is in science 
þat schal be lerned. 
For selde oþer neuere 
a man comeþ to parfit science 
but he bygynne as it were 
fro his cradel 
to Ʒeue hym to science. 
For þeiƷ þe angels be wel disposed 
fro here firste makynge to vnderstondyng 
and knowe kyndes of thinges, 
Ʒit man fro þe tyme 
þat he is ibore 
is euel disposed 
to take discipline and science. 
For þey oo man haue betere wit þan anoþer, 
Ʒut generalliche whan men ben ibore 
þei ben euel disposed to discipline and science, 
for owre knowyng bygynneþ and comeþ 
of þe witnesse of felyng and of þe later. 
Perfore, primo De Anima, 
þe philosofer meneþ 
þat þe soule 
is more tyme vncunnynge þan connynge, 
for a man vseþ studye long tyme 
or he come to parfit science and cunnynge. 
Þanne for oure lif 
is schort and artes and science 
ben harde and longe and comonlich | 
men ben ibore euel disposed to take science, 
Ʒif we wollen come som tyme to parfit science, we scholde bygynne in childhood 
and as it were fro þe cradel. 
Panne alle gentil men and noble and namelich kynges and princes Ʒif þei wol þat here children 
speke literal speche ariƷt 
and þat hey come to parfit science 
and be feruent 
and take good hede þerto, 
þei mote set hem to scole in childhood. 
For as it is iseid tofore, 
no man is kyndelich a lord 
but he be vnderstondyng, prudent, wis and redy. 
Þanne for by knowyng of lettres man is imaad 
þe more vnderstondyng, prudent, wis and redy, 
þe more semelich it is þat children of kynges and princes 
be more prudent, wise, and redy 
þan oþere children, 
þe more semeliche it is þat þei be sette to scole in childhood. 
And to preue þe same anoþer resoun may be brouƷt. 
For but a prince be vnderstondyng, prudent, wis and redi, 
ÜƷtliche he bycomeþ a tyraunt. 
For he reccheþ 
not of workes of vertues 
but þei tellen pris of money 
and outward good more þanne þei scholde. 
And þanne he bycomeþ 
a tyrant and pileþ 
and spoilleth þe puple. 
Þanne for children of kyngges 
and of princes scholde not be tyrantes 
whanne þei ben isette in lordschipe, 
it is semelich þat þei be sette to scole in childhood þat þei may be vnderstondyng, prudent, wis and redy. Chapter VIII 
Olde auctorite meneþ 
þat among men 
in olde tyme were seuene famous sciens 
þat ben icleped gramatica, dialetica, rethorica, musica, arsmetrica, geometria, astronomya. 
Alle þes | ben icleped liberal and fre sciens, 
for children of fre men and noble and gentil men 
were iset to þes sciens. 
And children of noble men lemede first gramer, 
for as Allepharabius seiþ 
þat gramer was ifounde for to saue þe speche wiþoute errour for me 
scholde not make defaute 
in sownynge of speche. 
And by gramer we seruen speche of philosoferes, 
for in suche speche þei made here bokes and tauƷte here sciens þan. 
Þanne for we suffisen not 
by vsself to fynde al 
þat nedeþ to sciens 
but vs nedeþ 
þerto helpe of philosofres and doctours, 
it is spedful to vs to konne 
and to knowe þe spech þat doctors and philosofers spekyn; 
and þat is iknowe by gramer. 
And þerfore gramer 
is acounted among liberal sciences, 
‡ for children of fre men 
and noble lernide þat science. Þe ii liberal science ‡ hatte dioletica and techeþ 
þe maner ofargewyng 
and of apposyng. 
For oure manere of konnyng 
is by þewe arguments and resons 
to preue and declare oure purpos, 
þanne it nedeþ to haue som science 
þat he techeth þe manere of makyng 
and formyng ‡ argumentis and resons. 
But we knewe þe manere of argewyng, 
we myƷt faile in arguyng 
and so be deceyued and trowe som tyme 
þat we conclude wel þey we conclude amys 
for we knowen not þe manere of argewyng. 
Þanne as grammer is nedful 
þat rewleth þe tonge 
þat we erre not in spekyng, 
so as Allepharabius seith, dioletica is nedful 
þat rewleth þe tonge 
and þe inwyt in argewyng. 
Þe þridde liberal science is rethorica. 
[Rethorica] 
is as it were boystous dioletica 
as þe philosofer meneth in Rethoricis suis. 
For as sotel resons ben imaad in natural science 
and in oþer | speculatif science, 
so boystous resouns ben imaad in moral science 
þat treteþ of doynges and dedes. 
Þanne as dioletica is nedful 
þat techeth sotelle and swyft manere of arguyng, 
so rethorica is nedful 
þat is as it were boystous dioletica 
and techeth boistous manere of argewyng and by liknesse and figures. 
And it is nedful to children of fre men and noble and nameliche to children of kynges and of princes, 
for þey mot be moche among men 
and be lordes of puple 
þat may not vnderstonde 
but boistous resons and liknesses and figures. 
Þe ferþe liberal science hatte musica and accordeþ to children 
as þe philosofer seith, 
viii Poleticorum, 
and namlich to children 
of fre men 
and noble for many resons. 
Oon þerof is for children mowe suffre no sorwe. 
Þanne for ━sum┐ ━likynge┐ scholde be graunted to hem, 
it is wel ido þat þey be ordeyned to likyng þat greueth not. 
Wherfore þe philosofer meneþ 
þat musik is acordynge to children kynde, 
for in musik is likynge þat greueth not. 
Þe seconde reson to þe same may be for as þe philosofer meneþ, viii Poleticorum, 
mannes þought 
can not be idel. 
Þerfore to putte of idelnesse 
it is good som tyme vse likyng of musik 
þat is laweful and greueth not. 
And þat is most semelich for children 
of fre men and noble þat vseth no craft of hond þe work and scholde be idel 
but he vsede liberal science 
and som tyme likyng of musik 
þat is laweful and honest. 
And in Poleticis þe philosofer toucheþ manye resons 
by þe whiche it myƷt be preued 
þat children of noble men schulde leme musik, 
| but on caas þat schal be touched inneremore. 
Þe fifte liberal science 
hatte arthsmetrica 
and techeþ proporcions of nombres. 
And þerto on caas children 
of fre men and noble scholde be sette, 
for þerwithoute musik may not be conne. 
Þe sexte liberal science 
is gemetri and techeth to knowe mesures and quantite of thinges. 
And þerto children of noble men ben isette, 
for þerwithoute astronomye may not be cunne parfitliche 
þat is of quantite of sterres 
and of þe space 
betwene sterres 
and of þe cours of hem. 
Þe seuenthe liberal science hat astronomye. 
And þerto children of noble men 
were iset in oolde tyme, 
for nacions and mysbeleued men 
were to besy aboute þe cours 
of þe sterres 
and to knowe eche fro oþer. 
And wolde neuere bygynne fightynge noþer oþer werk 
but þei knewe þe degree 
þat was ascendent 
and þe condicioun of heuene. 
And for þat is iknowe by astronomye, 
children of fre men 
and noble wolde lerne astronomye. 
In þis wise oolde men menede of liberal science 
and clepede hem seuene artes. 
Netheles many oþere science 
ben moche betre and more noble 
þan þes seuene, 
for natural philosofie techeth to knowe kyndes of thinges 
and is moche bettre þan eny of þe forseide seuene. 
But þis work suffreth not to trete þerof, 
for in þis work 
mot be boystous tretes 
by liknes of figures. 
Also methaphisica 
is ifoundeby trauaille and resons of mankynde 
and treteþ of God 
and of angelis 
and is moche betere þan natural philosofie 
and more worthi þan eny of þe forseide seuene. 
Þe philosofer, primo Methaphisicorum, ‡ seith þat kynde is more noble | 
and worthi and is to vnderstondyng of science 
þat ben ifounde 
by trauaille of mankynde, 
among þe whiche methaphisica bereþ þe pris. 
Also þeologia, 
d[i]uyni<t>e, 
treteþ of God 
and of angelis 
and is not ifounde be trauaille of mankynde 
but by inspiracioun of God 
and is withoute comparison betere and more noble 
þan al þe oþer. 
Also som moral science 
as ethica 
þat is of mannes owne rewelyng, 
and yconomyca þat is of rewelyng of manye, 
and politica þat is of þe rewelyng of citees 
and of regnes 
is ful good and nedful to children of fre men and noble. 
And as it schal be declared in þe processe, 
children of noble men 
and namlich of kynges and princes, 
Ʒif a wol lyue politik lif and rewle oþere men, 
schold Ʒeue hem most to þis science. 
And som science ben subalternate 
and vnder þes sciences, 
as þe science perspectiua 
þat is of þe sigt 
and vnder geometrie; 
and medicina is vnder naturel philosophie; 
and lawes þat ben of dedes of mankynde ben vnder poletica, 
þat is of rewelyng of citees and of regnes. 
For as we seide in oþer place, 
alle legistres ben as it were lewede, 
mad and ‡ nyce poletici. 
For as ‡ lewede men [and] þe comune puple, 
for he argueþ 
not and makeþ resons 
by þe manere of arguenge 
þat dioletica techeþ 
and for he argueth not craftyliche and by dioletica, 
þei ben cleped of þe philosofer 
ydyote dyaletici, lewed, maad, 
and nyse dialetici; 
so for legistres rekeneth 
withoute resoun doynges 
and dedes of polici, 
þei mowe be cleped ydyote politici, lewede, maad, and nyse politici. 
Herby it may be knowe how þei þat kunneþ poleticam and morale science 
scholde be more iworscheped 
þan þey þat [kunneþ lawes. For þey þat speken] | 
with konnynge and knoweþ 
þe cause and telleþ cause of kunnyng and of spekyng 
ben more worschepful 
þan þei þat speken 
and knowen not þe cause. 
Herby it may be knowe what clerkes scholde be moste yworscheped, 
for first dyuynes scholde be worscheped 
þat knoweth and kunneþ diuinite. 
For as God hymself is God of al, 
so diuinitee that is principaliche of God 
is god and lady of al science of mankynde. 
And after dyuynes methaphesici 
scholde be most worscheped, 
for as it is iseid tofore hond, 
among sciences þat ben ifounde by traueille of mankynde methaphisica bereth þe pris. 
And after hem naturel philosofres scholde be worscheped, 
for þei naturel philosofie be wiþinne methaphisica, 
Ʒit it bereth þe pris 
among alle oþere sciens 
þat ben ifounde 
by traueyle of mankynde. 
Þanne in þis wise clerkes 
scholde be werscheped in here degree. 
Þanne for science ben deuyded in þis wise, 
it may be sone iknowe aboute what science children of noble men and namlich of kynges 
and of princes scholde be occupied. 
And for þei mot be 
as it were half goddis 
and take besiliche heede to nedes 
þat longeth to rewelyng and mowe not a while to studie sotelliche in sotel science, 
þanne it is most semelich 
þat þei bere hem wel in Goddes seruice 
and knowe þe fey 
and be stedefast þerinne 
and kunne þe science 
by þe whiche he schulde 
kunne rewle hemself and oþere. 
And suche sciences ben moral sciences. 
And þey schulde kunne oþere science 
in so moche as he serueþ 
and helpeth to moral science. 
Þanne þei scholde | 
kunne gramer for to vnderstonde literal langage 
and speche 
in þe whiche langage 
and speche bothe moral science 
and oþer science 
ben iwrete and itauƷt. 
And þeiƷ gramer helpe not in moral mater, 
Ʒet kynges and princes schulde kunne literal langage and speche for to write here counsaile and preveyte to wham hem 
likeþ vnwetynge oþer men. 
And children of noble men, 
how euere þei be set and iordeyned 
to be knyƷtes 
and to Ʒeue hem 
to rewelyng and to politik mater, 
Ʒit þei scholde kunne literal speche and lerne 
som what of dealetica 
and of rethorica for to be þe more sotel to vnderstonde al nedes and tales 
þat ben purposed and itreted. 
And þanne þei scholde sette al here wit to vnderstonde moral mater and tokunne reule hemself and oþere. 
Andof musikas þe philosofer seith [in] Poletic[is] 
þei scholde kunne in so moche 
as it helpeth to good maners. 
Þanne in þis wise þei þat wolle be princes 
scholde knowe moral mater: 
so þat þei knewe non oþer science, 
Ʒut þei scholde bysiliche studie 
to leme moral mater 
boistousliche 
in comyn langage and speche, 
for þerby a prince is ytauƷt at þe folle 
in what wise he scholde be prince 
and how he may brynge hymself and citeseyns 
to vertues and good maneres. Chapter IX Circa finem, tercio Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer likneth þe concupiscible of princes 
to a childe and likneth resoun to þe maister. 
Þanne as þe concupiscible nedeþ 
to be rewled by resoun, 
so þe child nedeþ to be rewled by his maister. 
Wherfore as resoun 
draw|eth alwey to þe firste, 
as it is iseid, 
iii Ethicorum, 
and so þe maister of children 
scholde alwey excite hem to þe beste. 
Þanne for in lore 
and in techyng of children 
þe final entent is for to brynge hem to þe beste, 
for by þe ende and fynal entent 
þe resoun 
of al þe oþere scholde be take, 
þe maister schulde be suche oon 
þat myƷte brynge his children 
to þe beste. 
And þe beste good 
to þe whiche children 
scholde be brought is double: 
cunnynge and maners. 
And a childe is ibrouƷt to good maneres in twey manere wise: 
by ensample of good leuynge 
and by speche, warnyng and chastynge. 
And as it longeth to þis doynge, 
þe maister of children of noble men 
and namlich of kynges and of princes scholde haue þre in hemself: 
for þei scholde be konnynge in speculatif mater; 
prudens, wise, 
and redy in dedes and doynge; 
and good in leuynge. 
And to be konnynge in speculatif mater 
nedeþ þre. First, 
þat þei kunne fynde of hymself rewles and resouns. 
Þe seconde, 
þat þei kunne vnderstonde lawes and menynges of oþer men. 
Þe þridde, 
þat þei kunne wel deme in thinges 
þat þei fynden 
and also in þynges 
þat þei vnderstonden of oþere men. 
And þei scholde kunne fynde rewles and resons, 
for he þat can in no wise fynde rewles and resons 
but oonliche telleth 
þe lawes of oþere men 
is more verreyliche a rehersour 
þan a fyndere. 
Þanne he schulde kunne fynde. 
Þe seconde, 
þei scholde be vnderstondynge 
and alwey besy and scharpe of wit. 
For as | no man is suffisaunt to hymself 
at þe folle in leuynge, 
but for to haue suffisaunt leuynge 
we mot leue in companye so þat we may be releued 
by help of oþere men in þynges 
þat nedeþ to leuyng: 
and so moche more 
as þe philosofer meneth, 
ii Methaphisicorum, 
no man suffiseth to hymsilf in speculatif mater, 
but alwey þe later philosofres hauen help 
and socour of writynge of philosofres 
þat were tofore hem. 
Þanne it sufficeþ 
not to parfit konnyng 
þat a man kunne fynde rewles and resons but þei mot be besy and scharp of wit and vnderstonde menynge of oþere men. 
Þe þridde, 
þei mot kunne wel deme, 
for parfit science and kunnynge stondeþ 
most in good doom. 
For it is not inow to vnderstonde lawes and menynge of oþere men 
and fynde many rewles and resons 
but þei kunne also of thinges 
þat he vnderstondeþ 
and fyndeþ 
and deme whiche scholde be holde 
and whiche scholde be forsake. 
Þanne touchinge sciens and kunnynge þe maister 
and þe techere mot kunne wel fynde and vnderstonde 
and be besy 
and scharp of wit and wel deme of menyng 
þat he vnderstondeþ and fyndeþ. 
For þeiƷ it were so 
þat children of noble men 
and namelich of kynges and of princes 
wolde not trauele to haue al þe depnesse of science 
and of konnynge 
but holde hem apaied to knowe 
som what þerof, 
nathales Ʒut 
‡þe maister schulde be suffisauntf; 
for þe lore of wise men 
and redy is liƷt, 
and þei þat vnderstonden cler|liche speken clerliche. 
Þanne þei scholde vnderstonde þe more lightlyche and clerliche, 
cunne and knowe þe litel what þat þei desiren to leme, 
[by knowyngeþan by not knowynge]. 
Hit is iseye whiche þe maister scholde be 
and how he scholde be kunnynge; 
it is to wetynge 
how þei scholde be prudens, 
wise and redy in dedes and doynge for to teche children 
and forme hem in gode maneres. 
And to descreue suche pmdencia, wisdom and redynesse, 
þei we myƷte rekene al þe eiƷte 
þat we rekened 
in þe firste book, 
de prudencia, 
Ʒut heere it is inow to rekene foure þerof. 
Þanne þe maister of noble children 
scholde be so prudent and wise and redy 
þat þei ben avised and purveyed, 
waar and expert, 
and haue mynde of þynges 
þat ben apassed. 
For as he þat wolde strecche 
and riƷt a croked Ʒerde scholde neuere riƷte 
þat Ʒerde 
but he knewe whoderward 
and in what side 
þe Ʒerde is croked, 
so he þat wol righte and amende 
oþere men in dedes 
may neuere amende hem ariƷt 
but he knowe thinges 
þat ben apassed 
by þe whiche þei may knowe 
þat men don amys. 
Þanne he þat scholde teche oþere men mot haue mynde of thinges 
þat ben apassed. 
Þe seconde, 
þe mayster mot be avised 
and waar of thinges 
þat ben to comynge. 
For as þe techere and rewelere of oþere men mot haue mynde of thinges 
þat ben apassed 
þat he may knowe by thinges 
þat ben apassed 
in what wise his scolers ben myswend, 
so þei moot be avised 
and waar of thinges 
þat ben to comyng 
þat he may þe betere ordeyne 
remedye aƷenste | thinges 
þat may myshappe. 
Þe þridde, 
he moot be waar. 
For as we touchede in þe firste book, 
as in knowynge and speculatif matere it nedeþ to be waar leste falsenesse 
be medled wit trouthe, 
so in dedes and doynge it 
nedeþ to be waar leste euel be medled with trouthe. 
For som euel semeth good at þe firste siƷt 
and som falshede semeth trouthe. 
Wherfore as a maister in speculatif mater 
scholde be besy and waar and teche his scolers trouthe wiþoute medlyng of falsede, 
so he þat wol rewle children 
mot be waar 
and teche hem good 
withoute medlyng of euel. 
Þe ferþe, 
suche a mayster scholde be wel avised alle aboute and expert. 
For þei þat ben expert 
knowen particuler doynges 
and suche a mayster mot knowe particuler condiciouns of children 
þat he schal rewle. 
For as children hauen diuerse condicions 
and ben inclyned in diuerse wise to do amys, 
so þei mot in diuerse wise be itauƷt and ichasted. 
Þanne þe maister of children 
moot be suche oon 
þat may and can 
by þewe speche wamynge and chastynge 
to brynge þe children to good. 
And for a child is brouƷt to good not oonlich 
by warnynge and chastynge 
but also by ensau[m]ple of good workes, 
suche a maister moot be of good lif and honest. 
And for þe age of childhod 
is gretliche inclyned to intemporatnesse 
and to fleschly lust and likynge, 
þeiƷ þe maister of children 
teche neuere so good wordes, 
yit Ʒif he doþ þe contrarie in dede þe children 
folwen his ensample 
and ben sone inclyned to do amys. 
| 
And so it is declared 
þat þe mayster of children 
mot be connynge 
in speculatif matere 
and fynde of hymself rewles and resons 
and vnderstondeþ menynges of oþere men 
and deme wel bothe thinges 
þat he vnderstondeþ and fyndeþ. 
And touchy[ng] prudencia, 
wit <and> redinesse of dedes and doyng, 
he mot haue good mynde 
and be avised and waar and expert 
and take good hede; 
and touching þe lif he moot be honest and good. 
Þanne Ʒif kynges and princes and alle citeseins ben swithe besy 
in whaat wise 
þei mowe ordeyne 
for here children money and oþere 
r[i]chesses and soules catel; 
for þe philosofer seith, primo Polethicorum, 
alwey of souled þynges is more charge 
þan of vnsouled þynges 
and of children more þan of oþere, 
þei scholde be swyþe besy 
and with greet besynesse 
tak hede what maner maister þei taken to rewle here children. Chapter X Circa finem, 
vii Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer techeth 
þat children scholde be refrayned in spekyng 
and in lokynge and in heryng, 
for children scholde not speke in al maner wise 
noþer see ne loke in al maner wise, 
noþer hire ne herkene in al maner tales; 
but þere most be sum maner honest spekyng, 
lokyng and herkenyng. 
In spekyng children may faylle in þre maner wise: first, 
for þei speken gladliche of lecherie and of harletrie; 
þe seconde, 
þe[i] speken liƷtliche falshede; 
þe þridde, 
for comuneliche þei speken nycete and folye and withoute avisement. 
And first, þey speken of lecherie. 
| 
For as it is iseide tofore, primo [libro], 
children folwen passions 
and ben inclyned to lecherie. 
Þanne for alwey mot be a cautel where perel semeth, 
children scholde be refrayned of spekynge of lecherie 
and of foule wordes, 
and also þei scholde be chasted Ʒyf þei vsen suche spekyng. 
And þe philosofer seth þat þei scholde be refrayned and ichasted of foule manere spekynge, 
for li━ght┐liche by suche spekyng 
þey ben þe more inclined 
to suche manere dedes. 
For spekyng of foule thinges 
makeþ vs haue mynde of vnlaweful likynges 
and þerby oure desir 
is þe more to suche likynge; 
and whanne oure desire 
is þe more, 
we ben þe more inclyned þerto. 
Þerfore it is wel iseid 
þat schrewed talkynge 
corrumpeth and apaireth maneres. 
Þanne children scholde be refrayned 
and ichasted of spekyng of lecherie. 
Þe seconde, children scholde be refrayned and ichasted of spekynge falshede, 
for as we seide tofore, 
children fynden sone tales 
of here owne heed. 
And for vsage is as it were 
þe oþer kynde and yonge age 
inclyneth hem to speke falshede and lesynges 
and þat is euel of itself 
and to forsakynge 
as þe philosofer seith, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
þanne by þewe monyciouns, 
wamyng and chastynge, 
children scholde be brouƷt 
to forsake lesynges 
and to loue wel sothenesse and trouthe. 
And þat is god of itself and to preysyng 
as þe philosofer seith, iiii Ethicomm. 
Þe þridde, 
children scholde be refrayned 
of spekyng withoute avisement. 
For children ben inexpert 
and knowen but fewe thingges; 
and þei þat knowen but few 
þyng|es answeren sone 
and Ʒeuen a lewed answere 
and so a foles bolt is sone ischote. 
Wherfore children scholde be refrayned 
þat þei Ʒeue not here answere to sone; 
for þei no man be sodeynlich most parfit 
and þei children mowe not anon be parfit, wise and redy, 
Ʒit Ʒif þei vsen 
to answere with avisement 
and to speke not withoute avisement, 
þei mow be desposed in passyng of tyme. 
It is declared how maisters of children scholde teche hem how þei scholde haue hem in spekyng; 
it is to wetynge how children scholde be tauƷt in sight. 
And in lokynge of children moste be double cautele. 
First, touchynge thinges þat ben iseie; 
[seconde, touchynge maner of lokyng: 
and touchynge thinges þat ben 
iseie,] for as it is vnsemelich 
þat children speke foule, 
so it is vnsemelich 
þat þei see and looke on foule thinges. 
And þe philosofer telleþ þe cause heerof, vii Ethicorum, 
and seith þat al þe first we louen best. 
Þerfore alle foule thinges 
and al þat is infecte 
mot be strange to children, 
for þynges þat ben first iseie ben iseie with most wondryng. 
Wherfore we taken þe more heede 
þerto and hauen hem þe more in mynde. 
Þanne for alle thinges ben newe to children, 
þei taken þe more feruent heede to thinges 
þat þei seen, 
wherfore Ʒif it happeth 
þat þei see foule doynges, 
þei hauen þe more mynde þerof 
and ben þe more inclyned þerto. 
Þerfore þe philosofer forbedeth þat children 
scholde not onlich be refrayned 
of foule sightes in dede 
but also in peynture and images. Ʒif naked wymmen ben ipeynt and igraue þerinne, 
suche peynture scholde not be schewed for children. 
For children ben isterede of hemself 
at þe folle to lecherie and folweþ passiouns, 
| þanne hem nedeþ nought to be þe more istered to lust and likynge 
by siƷt of foule thinges. 
Þe seconde, 
a cautel mot be in techinge of children 
in siƷt and in lokynge, 
for þei mot be tauƷt to opene 
þe eiƷene soberliche and cast not þe eiƷene to loke nyseliche aboute. 
For þat age is inclined 
to see alle thinges 
for alle thinges 
ben as þeiƷ it were newe to þat age. 
Þerfore þat age fondeþ 
to se alle thinges 
and to loke in eche side. 
And þat is ful vnsemelich for kynges and princes 
yif þei casten here 
eyƷen and sight nyseliche aboute, 
for þerby þei scholde be holde liƷt hedede and lowe and feynt herted 
for it wolde seme 
þat he wondrede of alle thinges. 
Pan þey þat scholde be princes and lordes 
scholde be taug[t] 
in childehode of þe maner of lokyng and closing of eiƷene so 
þat [þei] opene and close here eiƷene soberliche, 
for a man doþ wel in ful age þynges þat þei vsen in childhode. 
It is declared how children scholde be tauƷt in speche, siƷt and lokyng; 
it is to declarynge 
how þei scholde be tauƷt in huyrynge. 
And as it longeth to þis doynge, 
heere mot be double cautele: 
first, touchinge þe thinges 
þat ben iherd; 
þe seconde, touchinge hem 
þat speken þe thinges. 
And in þynges 
þat ben iherd a cautel is 
ikept Ʒif children 
ben forbode to speke foule thinges. 
For þe philosofer, vii Poleticorum, 
þere þei speken of þis mater, 
seith þat children scholde be forbode to huyre 
eny foule thing for huryng is nyƷ þe doynge. 
Þanne as he meneth, 
children schold be forbode to huyre 
eny foule thing for þerby 
þei ben sone enclyned to do amys. 
Þe seconde, 
a cautel mot be among children touchyng | þe men þat þei huyren. 
For as it is semeliche 
þat þei huyre fayre thinges 
and honeste and vnsemelich 
þat þey heuyre foule thinges and vyle, 
so it is semeliche 
þat þei huyre good men and honest 
and þei scholde be forbode 
þe huryng of euel spekers and vnhonest. Chapter XI 
We hauen iseid tofore þat children scholde be tauƷt in good maners; 
but for as it is iseid 
tofore in moral matere 
vniuersal speche profiteþ luyte, 
it nedeþ to teche specialiche how children scholde be tauƷt in good maners. 
Wherfore after we haueniseid how children scholde bere hem in speche, in siƷt, and lokyng, 
and in huyrynge, 
it is to declarynge 
how þei scholde bere hem 
in mete and drynke 
and in dedes of wedlok. 
But first we schal telle 
in how many manere wise children 
may trespase in mete 
and how children scholde bere hem in mete. 
For in mete men and children may trespace in sex manere wise: first, Ʒif he taketh to feruentliche and hastiliche; 
þe seconde, Ʒif þei taken to moche; 
þe þridde, 
Ʒif þei taken in foule manere; 
þe ferþe, Ʒif inordinatliche; 
þe fifte, 
Ʒif to likyngliche oþer delicatliche; 
þe sixte, 
Ʒif to daungerliche arayed. 
A trespasseth first in mete Ʒif þei taken to feruentliche 
and to hastyleche. 
For þat greueth not onlich þe soule, 
for þei þat taken m[e]te to feruentliche 
and to hastiliche 
ben imaad glotons and intemporat, 
but also it greueth þe body 
for mete itake to feruentliche 
and to hastiliche 
is not wel ichewed, 
and it is þerfore þe worse deffied. 
For kynde ordeyneþ to bestis teeþ, 
þat mete ichewed wiþ teþ schulde þe better take worchynge of kynde hete and be þe | sonnere itomed in to norisching, 
as wode ihewe and ihacked smale brenneth þe sonnere 
and tumeth in to fuyre. 
And comynliche þei þat taken mete to fementliche 
and to hastiliche kepeth not þis ordre; 
for as þe philosofer seith, 
iii Ethicorum, 
likynge is whanne mete toucheþ þe tonge, 
but it is more likynge 
whanne it toucheþ þe þrote. 
Þanne þei þat taken mete to fementliche 
and wiþ gret likynge hauen not gret likynge while þe mete is in mouthe 
but he desireth to haue 
þe mete sone in þe þrote. 
Þerfore comynliche suche men chewen not þe mete 
but swolwen it vnchewed. 
Wherfore mete þat is so itake 
is not wel deffied and greueþ 
þerfore not oonliche þe soule 
but also þe body. 
Þe seconde, 
he trespasseth in mete Ʒif 
þei taken to moche þerof, 
for þat greueth þe soule, 
for þat makeþ it intemporate 
and þe body also, 
for þei letten good degestioun. 
For Ʒif mete schal be wel deffied, 
it mot be proporcionat to kynde heete. 
Wherfore Ʒif so moche mete is itake 
þat kynde hete may not haue maistrie þerouer, 
it may not wel be deffted 
and by þe consequent folwynge it 
norisschet not wel. 
Þe þridde, 
he trespasseth yyf þei taken mete in foule manere, 
for manye men kunnen vnneþe oþer neuere fede hemself 
noþer ete 
but þei defoule þeire clothes. 
And þeiƷ bodilich defouling 
be not trespas of itself, 
Ʒut it is trespas 
Ʒif it cometh of inordinat doynge of þe soule. 
Þanne for foule manere 
of takynge of mete is tokene of som glotonye 
and of inordinat doynge | 
of þe soule in takyng of mete, 
we scholde not onlich be war of takynge to moche 
but also of foule manere takynge. 
Þe ferþe, 
he trespasseth in takynge of mete 
by inordinat tyme 
as Ʒif þei taken [mete toforeþehoure oþer\ inordinatliche, 
for by suche takynge man is maad glotoun and intemporate 
and also þe body is igreved. 
For al kynde worchynge is imesured 
by certein durynge of tyme, 
as þe philosofer meneþ. 
Þerfore it is þat for vsage is as it were þe oþer kynde, 
þerfore Ʒif a man is vsed to ete 
in a certein houre, 
comynliche þei desiren to ete in þe same hour. 
Þanne Ʒif a man eteþ inordinatíiche 
and in oþer tyme of þe day 
þan he is vsed and takeþ þe seconde mete 
ar þe firste be deffied, 
þerby þe body is igreued. 
Þanne a man scholde ete 
in a certeyn hour 
and tyme of þe day 
not oonliche for goodnesse of þe soule 
but also for heele of þe body. 
Þe fifte, 
he trespasseth in mete Ʒif þei han gret desire to haue to likynge 
and delicate mete passynge his owne staat. 
For delicatnesse of mete is itake 
by þe condiciouns of þe persone and by estaat of his gentelnesse. 
Þanne he þat desireth delicat mete passynge 
þe condicioun of his persone 
and passynge his owne estaat trespasseth, 
for þat cometh of intemporatnesse 
oþer of som manere vice. 
Þe sixte, 
þei trespassen Ʒif þei axen mete to curiousliche araied, 
for in comyn mete and symple a man 
may be to grete glotoun 
Ʒif þei desiren to haue it to curiousliche arayed. 
For it semeth þat suche men lyuen 
for to ete and eten nouƷt for to lyue, 
for þei ben to besy to haue here | 
mete curiousliche isesened and arayed. 
Now is þis declared, 
it may sone be knowe how children scholde be taugt 
to haue hemself in etynge. 
For no man is sodenliche most parfit, 
it is inow þat children 
be tauƷt litel and litel so 
þat þei ben ful tauƷt whanne þei comen to ful age 
in what wise þei scholde bere hemself 
in takyng of mete. Chapter XII 
After þat we seide in þe nexte chapitre 
how me trespasseth aboute mete, 
it is to wetynge 
how me trespasseth aboute drynke. 
For it is iseide tofore 
þat Ʒong age 
is most inclined to intemporatnesse. 
Þanne for alwey most cautels 
scholde be vsed 
where most perel semeth, 
in childhood nedeþ most to be waar þat children be not intemporat. 
And intemporatnesse longeþ to þre: 
to mete and drynke and lecherie. 
For not onliche mete 
vnþeweliche itake 
is cause of intemporatnesse 
but also drynke is cause þerof. 
Þanne children scholde not onliche absteyne 
þat þei be not glotons 
by takynge of mete, 
but also þei scholde be sobre 
þat þei be not dronke 
in takynge of drynke. 
For wyn itake to moche, 
as it longeþ to þis doynge, 
doon þre harmes. 
For þe more heete is in þe bodye, 
þe more he is excited 
to dedes of lecherie. 
And wyn is most cause of heete and exciteþ to incontinence 
Ʒif it is itake to moche. 
Þanne to greet drynkyng of wyn 
for it 
meueth to incontinence 
scholde be left 
and forsake more in 30uthe þan in elde, 
for Ʒong age is more inclyned to lecherie 
þan olde age. 
Þe seconde harme þat comeþ 
of greet drynkyng | 
of wyn is beryng doun of reson. 
For whanne fumosite of wyne comeþ 
vp to þe heed, 
þe brayn is desturbled; 
and whanne þe brayn is desturbled, 
oure resoun is abated and ilet to dedes þerof, 
for þanne we may not freliche vse resoun. 
Þanne to gret drynkyng of wyn 
destourbeth þe vse of resoun, 
for it destourbleth þe brayn. 
And somme ben more ichaufed with wyne 
þan oþere for here heed 
is more feble 
and here brayn 
is more desturbled. 
Þanne children scholde be forbode 
gret drynkyng of wyne 
for here brayn is feble and sone destourbled with wyn. 
Þe þridde harm 
þat comeþ of wyn 
is debate and strif. 
For whanne þe brayn 
is desturbled 
by greet drynkynge of wyn and vse of resoun ilost, 
þei breken out sone and speken vnsittyng wordes 
and so comeþ debat and strif. 
And for wrathe cometh 
of hete of þe blood 
and wyn is hoot 
and heteþ 
þe blood and makeþ 
a man bold and hardy and wrethful, 
and whanne it is so, 
a man is þe sonnere imeued to debate 
and to stryue. 
Þanne as þe philosofer seith, 
ii [Rethorlicorum, 
for children louen stryf, 
þei scholde be forbode 
to greet drynkyng of wyn 
by þe whiche þei ben imeued to debate and to strif. 
Þanne in eche age 
it is good to be waar of to grete takynge of mete and of drynke. 
But [for] we vsen þe better doynges 
þat we hauen ivsed of childhod, 
it is semeliche þat alle fadres and namlych kynges and princes be besy aboute þe rewelyng of children 
þat þei be so 
ireweled in child|hood 
þat þey be abstynent and sobre. 
It is iknowe how children 
scholde haue hemself 
touchinge mete and drynke 
and it is to wetynge 
how þey scholde haue hemself 
in seruice of venus 
and in weddyng of wyues. 
For lecherie comeþ of glotonye 
as þe douƷter of þe moder. 
Þanne as we hauen iseyd þat children scholde be tauƷt so 
þat þei ben not glotons, 
it mot be seid how þei scholde be tauƷt so 
þat þei be not lecherous. 
Þanne for outake matrimonye eche dede of lecherie 
is aƷenst resoun 
and þe fader scholde 
so be besy aboute children 
þat þei may be vertuous, 
a child þat scholde be continent scholde be brouƷt 
in to holde hym apayed 
with his owne wif. 
And in what age Ʒonge men scholde vse þe dede of wedloc 
þe philosofer telleþ, 
vii Polethicorum, 
and seith þat a womman scholde be eiƷte 
and twenty Ʒere oolde and a man oon and twenty Ʒere oolde. 
For in suche age 
as he meneth ben most parfit children igete. 
But for þe vertue of generacioun 
is to swithe corupte, 
as we seide tofore, 
it were inow fo[r] Ʒonge men to absteyne hem comynliche 
fro þe dede of wedloc 
al here wexenge tyme þat dureth comynliche to þe oon and tweynty Ʒere. 
For Ʒif þei vsen þe dede of wedloc 
wiþinne þat age, 
þei ben imeued to lecherie 
and here wexinge is ilette 
as þe philosofer meneþ 
in his bokes of polici. 
Þanne þe dede of wedloc 
scholde be vsed in þis wise Ʒif oure vertue concupiscible 
were not to swythe corupt. 
But for it is drede of corupcioun of þat vertue concupiscible 
(that is for to say corrupcioun of vile stenkyng caryoun 
or elles vilþe and concupiscible 
þat is coueitous þat is likyng), 
Ʒif children maistres knowen 
þat þe chil|dren may not abide so longe tyme, 
‡ it may be do wiþinne þat tyme 
as hem semeþ 
þat it is spedful. 
And how Ʒonge men scholde bere hem to here 
wyues whan þat þei ben iwedded 
and what he schal desire in wyues 
þat he schal wedde we declarede at þe folle tofore 
þere we treted of rewelyng of wedloc. Chapter XIII 
For it is declared how children scholde be abstinent in mete, 
sobre in drynke, 
and temporate in dedes of lecherie, 
and wede wyues in þewe age, 
and bere hemself manerliche to here 
wyues whanne þey ben iwedded, 
it is to wetynge 
how þei scholde haue hem in pleyenge, 
in berynge, 
and in cloþynge. 
And þe philosofer seith, 
viii Polethicorum, 
þat pley is nedful 
in þe lif of mankynde. 
And as it longeþ to þis doynge, 
þat may be declared by twey weyes: 
þe firste, 
by voidyng of euel besynesse; 
þe seconde, 
by getynge of þe ende 
þat is desired. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For mannes þouƷt can not be idel, 
þanne whanne a man is idel 
and not occupied in good thinges and likynge, 
anon his thouƷt goþ aboute 
and he thinketh of sum vnlaweful thinges. 
Þerfore, viii Polethicorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat pley is ledyng awey 
and avoydynge of vnlaweful besynesse. 
And for men scholde not be besy 
in vnlaweful thinges 
and also for to put of vnlaweful likynge, 
it is spedful som tyme to haue pleyes 
and som likynge laweful and honest. 
And in whiche pleyes and likynge children 
scholde be occupied it 
schal be seid inneremore. 
Þe seconde wey to declare þe same 
is itake 
by getyng of þe ende 
þat is | desired. 
For a man may not alway haue þe ende 
þat he desireth. 
Þanne for he scholde not 
by continual traueyle faille in pursewyng for to come to þe ende, 
it is spedful to haue sum pleies 
and likynge among þe besynesse 
þat men may þerby haue som reste and trauaille 
þe bettere and pursewe for to come to þe ende. 
Þerfore, viii Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seith þat for a man 
may not alwey reste in þe ende 
þat is igete 
and for som tyme desireth 
an ende and traveilleth long tyme 
ar he come to þat ende, 
þerfore it nedeþ 
to som pleyes 
and som likynge 
þat þei faille not in pursewyng for to corae 
to þat ende. 
Þanne children scholde be so taugt touchinge pleyes 
þat þei be not forbode al manere pleyes, 
but þei mot haue 
in vse manerliche honest pleyes and liberal. 
But foule pleyes and foule spekyng 
and vnhonest lykynge scholde be forbode children 
as þe philosofer seith, vii Poleticorum. 
For it is iknowe how children scholde haue hemself in pleyes, 
it is to wetyng 
how he schulde haue hemself in beryng; 
and beryng here 
is icleped meuyng of membres and of lymes 
by þe whiche meuyng disposicion 
of þe soule may be know. 
For we seen þat goode men and wise hauin ordinat bering and honest, 
and suche men rewle so here 
lemes þat hauen none mevyng 
by þe whiche myƷte be suspecioun of pruyde or of vnwisdome 
and folye noþer of intemporatnesse of appetite. 
And lore in beryng is nedful to man, 
for man vnderstondeþ resoun 
and hat not suche kynde inclynacioun 
as bryddes and oþer beestes 
hauen noþer werchen 
by kynde inclinacioun 
as bryddes and oþere bestes | don. 
For briddis and oþere bestes 
þat worchen by kynde inclinacioun 
nedeþ not teching in lore 
as men neden þat vsen resoun and vnderstondyng, 
and is not inclyned 
at þe fulle 
by kynde to þew workes and dedes. 
And lore þat scholde be in berynge, 
as we speken here of berynge, 
is þat eche lyme be iordeyned 
to his owne work; 
for man hureth not wiþ his mouthe but with his ere. 
Þanne it were an idel for to Ʒonye 
for to huyre a tale. 
Also a man speketh not wiþ feet 
noþer wiþ hondes noþer with scholdres 
but with mouthe. 
Þanne as þei ben vntauƷt in beryng 
þat Ʒonet for to huyre oþer men to speke, 
[so] þei ben vntauƷt in berynge 
þat in spekyng streccheþ hedere and þedere foot and legges 
oþer casteþ 
þe armes to swith aboute oþer rereþ 
vp þe scholdres oþer doþ 
oþer doynges 
þat serueth not to spekyng. 
Þanne children scholde be so itaught 
þat þei haue suche beryng so 
þat þei vse meuynge of lemes 
as it serueth to workes 
þat þei menen 
and to doynge 
þat þei doun. 
For som meuynge of lemes 
þat seruen not to þe work 
þat scholde be doo comeþ of folye oþer of pruyde 
oþer of som vice. 
For þis is iknowe, 
it is to tretynge of þe þridde 
þat was rehersed 
in þe bygynnynge of þe chapitre 
– how children schulde haue hemself in cloþynge. 
And cloþinge is iordeyned for þre: 
for likynge, profit and worschepe; 
for al thing þat is good is likynge 
oþer profitable 
oþer honest oþer ‡ worschepful. 
And worschepful good 
is closed in honest good, 
for honest good is þe staat of worschepe. 
Þanne Ʒif cloþynge 
nedeþ for good 
þat is likynge, 
so nedeþ | hoot clothinge 
to putte of colde 
in þe wynter tyme 
oþer coold cloþynge 
to putte of heete in somer tyme. 
And Ʒif clothes nedeþ for worschep, 
so nedeþ faire cloþes and gaye. 
And it is vnsemelich 
to be besy 
to haue nesche cloþyng and softe for likyng 
þat is þerinne, 
for þerby a man is imad intemporate and ferful and falleþ 
liƷtliche to lecherie 
and to nesschenesse of flesch Ʒif þei ben to grete likynge in nasche cloþes. 
For suche semen more wommanliche þan manliche, 
wherfore þei ben not stedefaste 
but nesche and falleþ sone to lecherie. 
Þe seconde, 
to nesch cloþyng makeþ a man ferful. 
For armure and iren ben som del hard, 
þerfore he þat vseth alwey nesche clothing dredeþ 
to take suche thinges 
vppon hym 
and is imade ferful. 
Þanne children, 
and nameliche whanne he comeþ 
to þat age 
in þe whiche þei ben able to dedes of armes, 
scholde be tauƷt to haue not to gret likynge in nesche cloþyng. 
For it is iseid how children scholde haue hemself in clothinge 
þat serueth to likyng, 
it is to declaring how þei scholde haue hemself in cloþyng 
þat serueþ to profit. 
And þat is ‡ declared 
by a distynccioun 
bytwene hard complex[i]on and nesche; 
for þei þat hauen hard complexions 
ben lasse igreued 
with hete and wiþ colde 
þan þei þat ben of nesche complexioun. 
And so wymmen, 
for þei ben more flewmatik 
and hauen thikke complexioun 
and fole of pores and hooles 
as it is iknowe 
by scarsete of here, 
wymmen ben lasse igreued ‡ 
with hete and wiþ cold þan men. 
Also we | schal distingwe bytwene tymes; 
for in cold tyme whanne þe northeme wynd bloweth 
nedeþ oþer clothing 
þan in hoot tyme 
whanne þe southerne wynd bloweth. 
Also we maken a distinccioun of ages; 
for eelde, 
by cause þat it hath lasse heete wiþinne, 
nedeþ þe more heete withoute. 
Þanne by distinccioun of proprete of tymes, 
of complexioun, 
and of age, 
cloþynge mot be dyuers 
þat serueth for good 
þat is profitable. 
But as clothinge serueth to good 
þat is worschepful, 
we schal take heede of vsage 
of þe contray and of condicions of persones. 
Þanne children scholde be so 
itaught to haue hemself in clothinge so 
þat þei be not to besy to haue nesche clothing; 
takyng heede of þe condicioun of tyme, of complexioun, of age, 
of þe contray, 
and of persones, 
he schal vse þew cloþyng for profit of þe body. Chapter XIV 
Hit is not inow to knowe how children scholde haue hemself in pleyng and beryng 
and in clothing 
but me mot knowe also 
to what felawscipe þei scholde drawe. 
And as it longeþ to þis doyng, 
it semeþ þat children hauen foure condic[i]ons by þe whiche oure resons may be take preuyng 
þat namelich in Ʒong age euel company schold be forsake. First, for children ben nesche 
and wolle be ilad by oþere; 
þe seconde, 
þei folwen passions 
and ben inclyned to euel; 
þe þridde, 
þei louen to moche here felowes; 
þe ferþe, 
þei trowen to sone. 
Þan þe firste resoun 
for to declare þat children schuld namelich in Ʒong age forsaken schrewed companye 
is itake for ━þat┐ ━children┐ ben swiþe nesche 
and ilad by oþere. 
For comonliche þe soule folweþ 
þe complexioun of þe | bodye; 
for our knowyng bygynneþ 
of þe wit of felyng, 
and þynges þat ben iknowe by felyng 
ben most iknowe to vs. 
Þerfore comonliche men folwen þe appetite of felyng 
and þe appetite of felyng 
is a bodilich vertue; 
wherfore suche an appetite 
moot take manere and mesure of þe body. 
Þanne in þat age 
in þe whiche þe body 
is most nesche 
and most able to fonge diuerse schappes 
and diuerse inclinacioun, 
man is most nesche 
and most able to fonge diuerse schappes 
and inclinacioun by appetite. 
Þanne for nasche thinges and thinges 
þat ben able to fonge diuerse schappes 
fongen sone printyng of thinges 
wiþ þe whiche þei ben iunied, 
and þat sonnere þan don hard thinges, 
and children and Ʒonglynges, 
for þei ben more nesche 
and more able to fonge diuerce schappes and pryntes 
þan men of ful age, 
þe maners of here felawes ben sonnere iprynted in hem in Ʒong age 
þan in oþere age 
– þanne children 
scholde be forbode euel companye. (It is to wetynge 
þat þes twey wordes, mollis and ductilis, 
ben here itak in anoþer manere þanne in þe comyn speche. 
For in þe comyne speche 
mollis is nesche and ductilus is a thing 
þat streccheth in le[n]gþe oþer in brede with betyng of hamers. 
And as we speken heere he þat wiþstondeþ 
no temptacioun is icleped mollis, nesche; 
an[d] he þat folweþ sone oþere menne maneres 
oþer is ilad by oþere is icleped ductilis.) 35 40 Þe seconde wey to preue þe same is itake for Ʒong age 
is most inclyned 
to euel 
and folweþ passions, 
for sone a man is ibrouƷt in to assente to a thing 
to þe whiche he is | inclyned. 
Þanne for children 
ben inclined to euel, 
as we seide þere we treted of maneres of children, 
it is good to be war of euel companye and namelich in Ʒonge age. 
Þe thridde wey to preue þe same is itake for children louen frendschipe to moche. 
For as it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
children ben frendes 
and louen here felawes more þan oþere of oþere age, 
for it is ioye 
for hem to be togeders. 
And for þat age loueth principaliche þinges 
þat ben likynge 
and it is ful likynge 
to be wiþ frendes, 
þat age loueþ 
to be in companye 
and to haue frendschipe of felawes. 
Þanne children scholde be forbode euel companye 
and namelich in Ʒong age, 
for þanne þei folwen most þe maners of here felawes for þei louen 
most to lyue in companye. 
For likyng is whanne thinges 
þat accorden ben ifere, 
þanne no man loueþ 
to be in companye 
but he loue to acorde wiþ his felowes. 
Þe ferþe wey is itake for children trowen to sone. 
For likynge of felyng 
þat is vnlaweful, 
þow5 it be symplyche euel 
and to forsakyng, 
Ʒut it may seme good to children. 
Þanne for children trowen sone and hauen not parfit vse of resoun, 
þei ben sone ibrought in by here 
felawes to trowe 
þat scencible good is to louynge. Chapter XV For particular speche is ful profitable in moral matier, 
þerfore comynge downward particularliche to diuerse tymes 
we schal declare how children scholde be ikepte. 
And first, 
we schal declare how children scholde be kept forto þei ben seuen Ʒere olde. 
Þe seconde, 
| how þei scholde be kepte 
fro seuen Ʒeere oold 
to fourtene Ʒere old 
and so forþ. 
vii Polethicorum, 
þe philosofer toucheþ sixe 
þat schal be doun touchinge children 
in þe firste age. 
Þe firste, 
þat þei scholde be fed wiþ nesche mete forto he be seuene Ʒeere oold so 
þat þei ben first ifed with melk. 
Þe seconde, 
þat þei drynken non wyn. 
Þe þridde, 
þat þei ben ivsed to cold. 
Þe ferþe, 
þat þei vse manerliche meuyng 
and þat is prophitable in eche age. 
Þe fifte, 
þat he be conforted wiþ 
þewe pleyes 
and þat me telleþ hem stories and fables 
in þe whiche þei may haue confort and likynge, 
and þat nameliche whanne þei bygynnen to vnderstonde what men speken. 
Þe sexte, 
þat þei ben ikept fro wepynge. 
Þanne children scholde be ifed with nesche mete forto 
þei ben seuen Ʒeerolde, 
so þatþei ben firstmost ifed with melk. For,vii Polethicorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat moysture of melksemeþ 
most accordyng to bodyes of children. 
Þanne in þat tendre age forto þei been aboute seuen Ʒere olde 
þei scholde be fed wiþ nesche mete and moyst, 
for suche mete tumeþ sone in to norsching. 
Also Ʒif children scholde be fed wiþ 
oþere melk 
þan here owne moder, 
þei most haue a womman liche 
to þe moder in complexioun, 
for þe melk is most proporcionat to þe childe. 
Pe seconde, children scholde not drynke wyne and nameliche 
while þei souken and, 
as þe philosofer meneþ, 
þat is for siknesse. 
For children taken sone siknesse 
and ben euel disposed in þe body comynliche Ʒif þei drynken wyn while þei ben ifed wiþ melke, 
and som menen þat þei ben desposed to lepre Ʒif þei vsen to drynke wyn þat tyme. 
Þe þridde, 
children scholde be vsed to cold. 
Þerfore, vii Pole|ticorum, 
þe philosofer seith þat it is spedful 
þat smale children ben vsed to cold 
and þat is profitable for tweyne: first, 
for heele of þe body. 
Þerfore þe philosofer seith þat vsyng to cool makeþ good disposicioun in children 
by cause of heet 
þat is wiþinne hem. 
Þe seconde, vsynge of children 
to coold is good and profitable for dedes of armes. 
For colde fastneþ þe lymes and membres and maken hem sad, 
so þat þei ben þe more able to do dedes of armes 
whanne þei comen to age 
Ʒif þei ben in childhood 
som del ivsed to coo[l]d. 
Þerfore þe philosofer seith þat among somme strange nacions 
it is an vsage to bathe children 
in cold ryuers for þei scholde be þe more stronge. 
But it is to wetynge 
þat whanne we seyen þat children 
scholde be vsed to þis oþer to þat it schal be vnderstonde manerliche and in gre 
as in condicions of persones axenge. 
Þe ferþe, children scholde vse conuenient and temporat meuyng, 
for þe philosofer seith þat temporat meuynge in children 
ben foure manere goode. 
For it makeþ þe body 
þe moore hool; 
for in eche age, 
skilful besynesse and trauele helpeþ 
for heele of þe body. 
Þe seconde, 
it makeþ þe body swift; 
for Ʒif children ben not ivsed 
to som manere meuyng in childhood, 
þei ben slowe and heuy slogardes. 
Þe þridde, 
it helpeþ to wexinge of children, 
for temporat and skilful trauele helpeþ 
to good digestioun 
and makeþ good disposicioun in þe body and helpeþ 
þerfore to wexinge. 
For wexinge cometh of mete and drynke, 
and thinges þat maken þe body wel desposed and wel ifed and inoresched helpeþ to wexinge. 
Þe ferþe, moderat and skilful meuynge maken þe lemes and membres sad; 
for eche man feleþ in hymsilf 
þat Ʒif þei | 
vsen skilful bodylich trauele, 
his lymes ben þe more sad 
and þe more stronge. 
Þanne children 
þat hauen to tendre lemes scholde be vsed 
to som smale and temporate meuyng to make here lymes stedefast and sadde. 
For, vii Polethicorum, 
þe philosofer seiþ 
þat it is spedful in children 
to vse som smale meuynges for to vse þe lymes so 
þat þe lymes faile not for tendernesse. 
For þe philosofer preiseth so skilful meuynge in children 
þat þei seien þat fro þat þei ben first ibore þey scholde be irokked and imeued in cradels oþer in som oþer thinges. 
Þe fifte, children scholde be conforted wiþ som pleyes and som fables. 
For moderat pley accordeþ to children, 
for in moderat pley is moderat mevyng 
and moderat meuyng putteþ of slouthe and nysete and makeþ 
þe lymes swepere and sweft. 
Also me scholde telle children tales and som fables and stories 
whanne þei can vnderstonde what men speken. 
Also me schole teche hem honest songes. 
For þei mowe suffre no thing 
þat greueþ hem, 
þerfore it is good to vse hem 
to moderate pleyes 
and to som honest likynge 
þat is not greuous. 
Þe sixte, children schulde be kepte 
f[ro] wepynge. 
For whanne children ben ikept f[ro] wepyng 
þan þei holden in spirit and breeth; 
for whanne þei wepiþ, spirit and breeþ passeþ out of hem. 
So whan þey wepen not, 
þei holden in spirit and breeth and, 
vii Polethicorum, 
þe philosofer seiþ 
þat holdyng in of spirit and breeþ makeþ þe body strong. 
Þanne for children scholde be þe more strong, 
þei scholde be kept fro wepynge. Chapter XVI 
For we distingwen ages of children 
fro seuen Ʒere | 
to seuene Ʒeere and sayen 
þat þey scholde be rewled 
in þis wise forto 
þei ben seuen Ʒere olde 
and in þat wise 
fro seuen Ʒere to fourtene Ʒere, 
and suche tyme of seuene Ʒere may be take lengere oþer schortere 
by diuersite of persones 
for somme ben more stronge of body 
in fourtene Ʒeere þan oþere in sextene, 
þanne for in suche doynge 
we may not Ʒeue a rewle 
þat may not chaunge, 
som what mot stonde in þe maisters doom 
þat techeth þe children 
so þat he may take suche a tyme lasse oþer more 
as hym semeth 
þat i[t] is spedful. 
And in þe tyme 
þat is fro seuen Ʒeer to fourtene 
þre mot be knowe 
in rewelyng of children. 
For a man is first departed 
in body and soule, 
and þe soule hath vnderstondyng 
and appetite 
as principal potencial vertues. 
And þre mot be knowe in children: 
first, 
what manere body þei ben; þe seconde, 
what manere wille; 
þe þridde, 
what maner vnderstondynge. 
Þanne for children scholde haue þe body wel desposed, 
þei scholde vse þewe besynesse 
and þewe meuynge; 
and to haue þe wille wel iordeyned, 
þei scholde be brouƷt 
in to good vertues 
and in to workes of vertues; 
and for to haue parfit vnderstondyng, 
þei scholde lerne good science. 
Þanne science, vertue and besyinesse scholde be knowe in rewelyng of children. 
And for to putte of slewthe of children, 
children scholde vse som meuyng 
fro þe tyme þat þei ben first ibore. 
But fro þe tyme þat þei ben seuene Ʒere oolde anon to fourtene Ʒere 
þei scholde vse strengere and strengere besynesse and traueile. 
| And Tacuinnus seith þat bal pleying is good besynes for children 
and þe philosofer seith þat wrestlyng is good besynesse for children. 
But in þe seconde seuen Ʒeer þei scholde vse strongere besynesse 
þan in þe firste seuene Ʒere; 
bot for þei ben swithe tendre in þat age, 
þei scholde not vse dedes of armes 
noþer passynge stronge workes. 
Þerfore, viii Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seith þat forto þe heer spryngeth 
in þe schaar 
and forto fourtene Ʒeer, 
þei scholde vse liƷt besynesse and travele lest here wexinge be ilet. 
It is declared þat for children 
scholde be desposed wel in þe bodye, 
þey scholde vse strengere besynesse 
and trauele in þe seconde seuene Ʒeer þanne in þe firste seuene Ʒere. 
It is to wetynge how þei mot be iordeyned to vertues 
so 
þat here wille be wel desposed. 
Þanne it is to wetynge þat, 
v Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seith þat it is þe worste of alle Ʒif children 
ben nouƷt itauƷt to holde good lawes. 
For, vii Polethicorum, 
þei trete whether it is more charge 
and whether is first to chargenge in children whether þei hauen good appetite 
oþer parfit vnderstondynge. 
And he preueþ 
þat it is rather 
to chargyng of ordinat wille 
þan of parfit vnderstondyng. 
Þanne in þe seconde seuen Ʒeere, 
for þanne children bygynnen to haue fleschliche likynge 
and hauen not parfit vse of resoun, 
it semeþ in þat it is to chargynge 
þat þei hauen good wille 
and wel iordeyned. 
For as in generacioun þe body 
is tofore þe soule, 
for þe bodi is first ischape with lymes and membris 
and þanne þe soule is idoo þerinne, 
so as þe philosofer seith, 
vii | Poleticorum, 
it is rather to chargyng þat children haue [ordenat wille þan] witty vnderstondyng. 
And no man hath ordenat wille 
but he haue moderat likynge, 
for in euel ordenance of þe appetite of felynge comeþ euel ordinance of þe wille. 
Þanne for fleschliche likynge 
is in þe bodye 
and good vnderstondynge 
is in þe soule, 
for in wey of generacioun þe body is tofore þe soule, 
it is raþer to wetyng 
how we may haue moderat 
lust and likynge and ordinat wille þanne 
how we may haue parfit vnderstondyng. 
And þe manere in þe whiche lust 
and likynge of children 
scholde be imaad moderat is by a special cautel in thinges 
þat children desiren comunelich most. 
Þanne for children folwen lust and likynge and lieth gladliche and don al here doynges passyng so 
þat whanne þei louen þe[i] louen to moche 
and whanne þei bygynnen to play 
þei playe to moche 
and so in oþere þei passen alwey mesure, 
þanne þer mot be a cautel 
þat þei folwe not lust and likynge 
but þat þei be abstinent and sobre and þat þei be not liers 
but soth sayers 
and þat þei do not alle doynges passyngliche bot 
þat þei ben moderate in here workes and dedes.5 10 15 Þis is iknowe 
and it is to declaryng 
how þei scholde be wel disposed in vnderstondynge. 
For whanne we seide þat in þe seconde seuene Ʒeere 
it is more principalliche to chargyng of ordinat appetite 
þan of parfite vnderstondyng, 
it schal not be so vnderstonde 
þat it is in non wyse to chargyng 
how children may haue parfit vnderstondyng. 
But fro seuen Ʒeer to fortene Ʒeere children 
hauen greet | lust and likynge and fayleth 
in vse of reson. 
Þerfore it is more principaliche 
to chargyng of ordenate appetite, 
for as it were by alle þe seconde seuene Ʒeere children 
lemeþ not but wordes 
for þei ben not Ʒit so witty to vnderstonde 
and knowe þe parfit þynges. 
Þerfore in þe seconde seuene Ʒeer children 
scholde leme gramer 
þat is a science of wordes, 
and logik þat is more verreyliche 
þe manere of konnynge 
þan oþere science, 
and þe p[ra]ct[ik] of musik 
þat stondeþ in acord of voyce. 
For in þat tyme children faillen þe vse of resoun 
and mowe not haue parfit cunnynge. 
But for þei scholde not be al vndesposed to science 
whanne þei comen to vse of resoun, 
þei scholde þes artes leme and sciences of þe whiche we maken mynde. Chapter XVII 
It is iseide tofore 
þat toching children 
þre moste be knowe: 
how þei scholde haue þe body wel desposed, 
and þe appetite wel iordeyned, 
and parfit vnderstondyng. 
And we may applie þes þre to þre seuen Ʒeres; 
for in þe firste seuen Ʒere 
after <feth> 
and sacramentƷ of Holy Cherche 
it is principaliche to chargynge 
how children mowe haue þe bodye wel desposed. 
In þe first seuen Ʒeere children 
ben as it were wiþoute vse of reson; 
þei mowe not wel vse workes of vertues 
noþer lerne greet science. 
For Ʒif þei mowe ouƷt leme in þat tyme, 
it is comyn langage and speche. 
But fro seuen Ʒeere oolde to fourtene, 
for þei bygynneþ to haue 
som euel lust and likyng 
and som del vnparfit vse of resoun, 
þerfore in þat tyme 
it is not oonliche to chargynge 
how þei mow haue parfit vnderstondyng 
but also howe þei mowe haue appetite wel iordeyned. 
For anon to fortene Ʒeere | 
as þe philosofer seith [in] Polethic[is], 
children scholde be ilad to good more 
by vse þanne by resoun. 
But fro fourtene Ʒeere þei bygynnen to haue vse of resoun 
and is not oonliche to chargyng 
how þei mow haue þe body wel desposed 
and þe appetite wel iordeyned 
but also þat þei be wyse and redy 
and haue cleer vnderstondyng. 
For þanne forþward 
þei mowe leme not oonliche gramer 
þat semeth 
as it were a science of wordes, 
oþer dialetica 
þat is as it were 
þe manere of konnyng <of arguyng>, 
oþer þe practfik] of musik 
þat stondeþ in acord of voyce, 
but þei mowe lerne þelke science 
in þe whiche science 
it is nede to take heede 
and knowe þe verrey þynges by þe knowynge of þe whiche thinges 
we may be wise and waar and redy. 
Þanne in þe firste seuen Ʒere 
after þe fongyng of þe follouƷt and sacramentes 
it is as it were principaliche to chargynge of oon 
þat is good disposicioun of þe body; 
and in þe seconde seuen Ʒere 
as fro seuen Ʒeer to fourtene Ʒeer 
it is as it were principalliche to chargynge of tweyne, 
of good disposicioun of þe body 
and of ordeyned appetite; 
but in þe þridde seuen Ʒeere 
þat is fro fourtene Ʒeere 
and so forth 
it is to chargynge of þre, 
of good disposicioun of þe body, 
of ordeyned appetite, 
and of parfit vnderstondyng. 
Good disposicioun of þe bodye in hem 
þat wol lyue politik lif, 
þat is to menynge in comynte and by lawe, 
scholde fro fourtene Ʒere 
and so forth take more strong besynesse and trauele 
þan tofore hond fourtene Ʒeer. 
For, vii[i] Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seith þat anoon to fourtene Ʒeere | 
þei scholde vse esy traveille 
and after fourtene Ʒeere 
þe[i] scholde vse more strong traueylle. 
And þe philosofer seith þat fro fourtene Ʒeere forþward children 
scholde vse so strong traueille 
þat þei scholde vse wrastlyng and ridyng oþer som dedes liche to þe dedes of armes so 
þat þei ben in þe eiƷtene Ʒeere lerned and itauƷt in wrastlyng and rydyng 
and in oþere dedes of armes and of cheualrie so 
þat þei mowe vse traueille of cheualrye. 
For a man is wel desposid 
in his bodi 
whanne his bodi 
is such as nediþ for his office, 
as a knyth is wel desposed in his body 
whanne his body 
is suche as nedeþ for a knyƷtes office; 
and þat may not be withoute stronge dedes and trauele. 
Þanne for alle þat wol haue politik lif in comynte comynne and by lawe 
mot som tyme haue strong traueylle for defens of þe comynte, 
al þat wol lyue suche a lyf scholde, 
fro fourtene Ʒere and so forþ, 
scholde lerne and vse stronge dedes and trauele so 
þat Ʒif tyme come 
þat comyntee haue nede to defence 
þat here body be so desposed 
þat þei mowe take suche trauele an honde 
þat þe comynte may be defended by hem. 
And ho scholde vse suche trauele more oþer lasse it schal be declared in þe processe; 
and it is inow 
at þis tyme to knowe þat faders scholde be besy to rewle here children 
so þat here body be wel desposed so 
þat þei mowe take þew trauele an honde, 
and þat may wel be namelich Ʒif þei vsen þew doynges and dedes. 
For it is iknowe how fadres scholde be besy aboute here children 
for fro fourtene Ʒere 
and so forþ so 
þat here body be wel desposed, 
it is to wetynge | 
how þei scholde be besy aboute hem so þat here appetite 
be wel iordeyned. 
And it semeth þat fro fourtene Ʒeer 
and so forth children 
trespassen in twey maneres 
by vnordeyned appetite. Frist, in pruyde; 
for whanne þei begynnen to haue som deel parfit vse of resoun, 
it semeth hem þat þei ben worthi 
to be lordes 
and hauen indignacioun 
to be sogette to oþere. 
Þe seconde, 
þei trespassen in lecherie 
and vnlaweful doynge. 
Þanne alwey, 
for by war of greet perel 
nedeþ a cautel, 
fro fourtene Ʒeere and so forþ children 
scholde be specialliche itauƷt and iwamed 
to be not prout 
but to be soget and obedient 
to here fadres and to here eldere. 
And, vii Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer toucheþ 
þre schorte resons 
whi children scholde be soget and obedient to here faders and to here eldere. 
Þe firste resoun 
is for faders and eldere commandeþ 
þe children 
for here owne good and profit, 
and eche man scholde be obedient 
to hym 
þat he woot wel þat commandeþ 
hym no thyng 
but for his owne good. 
Þe seconde is whan children comeþ to parfit age, 
þei schollen be lordes. 
Þan þe while þey ben in yong age [þei] scholde be obedyent 
to fadres and eldres for to Ʒeue 
oþere ensample 
to be obedyent and serue hem 
whan þei comen to ful age. 
Þe þirde reson is for he þat wol lerne to be a prince 
mot firste leme to be a soget. 
Þerfore þe philosofer seith þat no man 
is a good prince 
but he leme firste to be suget, 
for noon is good maister 
but he be first a good disciple. 
Þanne children for to be good princes 
schul not haue indignacioun 
to be soget 
to fadres and to eldres. 
Þanne þe appetite of children 
scholde be first ireweled 
in þe age 
þat we speken of | so 
þat þei be obedient to fadres and to eldres. 
Þe seconde, 
here appetite scholde be rewled 
þat þei vse not vnlaweful lecherie. 
For fro fourtene Ʒeer children schulde not oonliche be brouƷt in to be abstinent and sobre in mete and drynke 
but þat þei be also continent and chaast touchinge 
dedes of lecherie for, 
as it is iseid, 
þerafter þei ben more feruentliche excited to lecherie. 
Þerfore þei scholde be brouƷt in in þat age to vse no suche dede oþer elles to holde hem apaied eche 
with his owne wif. 
For it is declared how in children after fourtene Ʒeer þe body scholde be wel desposed 
and þe appetite wel iordeyned, 
it is to declarynge how þe vnderstondyng scholde be parfit. 
And þat may be knowe clerliche by thinges 
þat ben iseid. 
For fro fourtene Ʒeer and so forth 
þei bygynnen to haue more parfit vse of resoun 
as it is iseid 
fro þat age forþ, 
þei mowe leme not onlich gramer 
þat is as it were science of wordes, 
oþer dioletica 
þat is as it were 
þe maneres of konnyng, 
oþer by practik of musik 
þat stondeþ 
in acord of vois, 
but þey ben also able to leme bettre science and thinges 
þat longeþ to gretter science. 
Also it is knowe by thinges 
þat ben iseid þat Ʒif þei wollen lyue politik lif in laweful comynte and lif of cheualrie, 
þei scholde specialliche studie 
in moral science for þerby 
þei mow knowe how þei scholde rewle hemself and oþere. 
And [a] Ʒong child 
is not suffisaunt scolere of moral matere and science 
in to Ʒong age 
for þei folwen passions in þat age. 
And þat age dureth anoun to fourtene Ʒeere 
and in þat age 
þei scholde not lerne suche sciens. 
But fro four|tene Ʒeere 
and so forþ Ʒif children refraynen hemself 
þat þei folwe not passions and lecherie, 
þei ben desposed 
to be suffisaunt scolers of morale science 
by þe whiche þei mowe 
konne rewele hemself and oþere. 
Þanne fro fourtene Ʒeer forþ children 
scholle be rewled in þat wise 
as fro fourtene Ʒeer to oon and twenti oþer to fife and twenty oþer to vii and xx. 
And Ʒif me axe how men scholde be reweled 
afterþat 
age,for þanneþei ben icome 
as itwere tofolle perfeccioun, 
þei scholde þanne cunne rewle hemself. 
Þanne þerafter hem 
nedeþ not a mayster to rewle hem; 
but by thinges 
þat we seide in þe firste book 
þat is of manis owne rewelyng, 
þey mow take lore how þei scholde rewle hemself. Chapter XVIII 
Alle children þat wol lyue pollitik lif in laweful comynte scholde in som wise vse bodiliche traueylle. 
Ʒif it is moderat, 
hit semeþ profitable to alle for it 
helpeþ to hele 
and to good disposicioun of þe body; 
for whan þe body is hoot by moderat meuynge superfluyte 
is put out þerof. 
And suche bodilich traueile semeþ specialiche profitable to hem 
þat wol lyue cyuyle lif 
in citees and in townes. 
For suche ben not moche occupide 
in studyng noþer 
in spiritual likynge, 
it is spedful to hem to vse laweful bodilich traueille for to putte of sleuthe 
and euel besynesse. 
For it is spedful for al þat wolle lyue politik 
lif þat is in laweful comynte – bothe to citeseyns and noble men 
and to kynges and princes 
and to oþer – 
to be not al idel withowte bodilich 
traueille noþer 
to vse alwey dedes of armes. 
For moderat bodilich traueille makeþ | þe bodye strong 
þat it may be þe bettre wiþ hard armere. 
For vse of armere 
is not oonliche lefful som tyme 
but it is also nedful for profit 
of þe comynte, he þat wil lyue politik lif schulde not be al lewed 
and vnkunnyng in dedes of armes. 
But not alle children schulde vse alle ileche moche suche bodilich traveylle, 
for children of kynges and of princes schulde lasse vse suche traueille þan oþere; 
and þe eldest child 
þat schal regne schulde vse las trauaille þan oþere. 
For, viii Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seith þat bodelich traueille and studie letteþ eiþer oþer. 
‡ Here of may come not[e] of þynges 
þat ben iseid, 
ii De Anima, [þer] it is iseid we seyn 
þat þei

Þan to [ha]ue gode wit and vnderstondyng, 
vs nede to haue nesch flesch [and tendre]. 
Þan bodilich trauaile 
þat makeþ þe flesch hard 
letteþ scharp witte. 
Þan it is wel iseid, 
7 [Phisjicorum, 
þat in sittyng and restyng

For by sittyng and reste þe flesch 
is imade nesch, 
and þerwith we ben imade able 
for to studie speculatif science 
þat is conyng; 
for by trauaile and [m]euynge 
þe flesch is imaad hard 
and þerby scharpnesse of wit is ilette. 
And it is more semelich 
þat þei þat rewlen a regne ben wise and redy þan grete werryours. 
For in rewlyng and gouernance wisdom 
is better þanne armes of werre, 
for kyng and prince and eche greet lord 
in bataille 
and in dedes of armes 
is as it were no bettre þan on man 
and som tyme lasse worthi þan anoþer man. 
But by wisdome and 
redi|nesse som man may be more worthi 
þan al þe men 
þat ben vnder hym. 
For al þe puple 
and al þe men 
of þe regne may litel do 
but þei ben wel ioned and iordeyned by redinesse, 
redynesse of þe kyng may do ful grete dedes. 
Þanne þei kynges and princes scholde not alle vnknowe dedes of armes 
noþer þei scholde so forsake bodilich traueile 
þat þei be maad 
as þei it were wymmen 
and be not hardy 
to vse dedes of armes 
for defense of þe regne noþer for oþer causes, 
natheles for it is more semelich 
þat þei be wis and redy 
þan grete werriours, 
children of kynges and of princes 
and namelich eyres scholde lasse vse bodilich trauaille 
þan oþere menis children 
lest by such trauaille here 
flesch be maad hard 
and lette sotelnesse of wit. 
Þan suche cheldren schuld seue hemself more to wisdom and to redinesse 
þan to bodilich strengþe. 
And a Ʒeueþ hem to redinesse 
Ʒif þei Ʒeuen hemself 
besiliche to moral science 
þat þei mowe knowe maners and dedes of me‡n. 
Þanne þei þat scholde rewle oþere men 
þei scholde forsake sleuþe 
and euel besynesse 
and Ʒeue hemself to moral science 
and haue in mynde goode vsages and customes of þe regne 
and of here forfadres and huyre ofte dedes and doynges of hem 
þat rewlen wel þe regne. 
Þanne in þis wise 
þei scholde Ʒeue hemself 
to dedes of wisdom and of redynesse, and kynges and princes scholde more forsake slewþe 
and Ʒeue hem to wisdom and redinesse þan to strong bodylich trauele. Chapter XIX 
For not alwey of þe vse of wedloc comeþ sones and maales 
but som tyme comen douƷtres and femeles, 
after þat we hauen itreted 
how sones | scholde be irewled, 
it is to tretynge 
how douƷtres scholde be rewled. 
But herto nedeþ a schort tretes, 
for whan we treted of rewlyng of wedlok 
and declared how femeles scholde be rewled, 
we declared as it were atte folle how douƷtres scholde be rewled. 
For as it is semelich 
þat wyues be continent and chaast and abstinent and sobre, 
so it is semelich 
þat douƷtres be also. 
Þanne þes condicions and many oþere 
þat were rehersed of wifes longeþ also to douƷtres, 
but som what we schal putte more tofor good rewlyng of douƷtres. 
And first, we seyen þat douƷtres scholde be ikepte 
fro strayenge and rennynge aboute and þat we may preue by þre weyes. 
Þe firste wey is for to byneme hem ese and tyme of euel doynge. 
Þe seconde, 
þat þei be notvnschamefast. 
Þeþridde, 
þat þei be not strumpetliche and lecherous. 
For comynliche al men ben inclyned to euel 
and wymmen wel more, 
for þei faillen more 
in vse of resoun. 
For it is iseid tofore 
þat oure knowyng comyþ 
of sencible wit 
and sencible thinges 
ben to vs most iknowe, 
þerfore it is 
þat comynliche men tellen no prise 
but of sencible good. 
Þanne for we haueþ 
so greet inclinacioun 
to sencible likynge, 
comynlyche we trespassen 
in suche likynge 
Ʒif we hauen ese and tyme þerto. 
Þerfore [in] Rethoridis] 
þe philosofer meneþ 
þat comynlich men don euele 
whanne þei mowe. 
Þan þe beste cautele to saue and kepe clennesse and innocence 
is for to forsake ese and tyme of mysdoyng. 
Þerfore in a prouerbe it is iseid 
þat ese <makeþ> a þeef. 
Þanne Ʒif it is greet | peril in men 
þat connen more reson 
þan wymmen not to forsake ese of trespace, 
it is wel more perelle in wommen 
and Ʒit more in douƷtres oþer in wenches. 
Þanne for þei scholde haue noon ese and tyme of mysdoynge, 
þei scholde be wel ikepte and forbode strayenge and rennynge aboute. 
Þe second wey to preue þe same is 
for þei scholde not be vnschamefast. 
For thing þat is selde iseye 
is som del schamfastlich, 
for þat is noƷt ivsed among men 
schameþ to come among men. 
Þan a[m]ong oþer 
þat maken wenches ‡ schamefast tofore men 
is not vsed to come among men. 
Wherfore whanne wenches strayen and gon aboute by contrees, 
þei vsen to be among men 
and been homeliche with hem, 
and schamefastnesse is bynome hem 
by companye of manye men; 
for it is al oon 
to byneme wenches schamefastnesse 
and to byneme hem 
þe bridel 
by þe whiche þei ben withdrawe 
þat þey do not amys. 
For in wymmen and namelich in Ʒonge wenches faillen resoun 
by þe whiche þey scholde be wiþdrawe 
þat þei doun not amys, 
þanne it semeþ 
þat schamefastnesse 
is þe beste bridel of wymmen and namelich of Ʒonge 
wenches to wiþdrawe hem 
fro schameful dedes and doyng. 
Þanne Ʒonge wenches scholde be kepte 
fro strayinge and goynge aboute 
þat þei be not vnschamefast and þat þei lese not schamefastnesse 
by þe whiche þei ben withdrawe 
fro schameful workes and dedes. 
Þe þridde wey, 
þat þei be not strumpettes and gygelottes. 
For Ʒif Ʒong wenches ben wel ikepte and iholde 
þat þei go not | 
astraying aboute, 
þei ben not onliche schamefast 
but also hauen þerby a manere wildenesse 
þat is best to saue and kepe chastite in Ʒonge wenches. 
For we seen þat ful wilde beestes 
bycomen tame Ʒif þei vsen to be among men 
so 
þat þei soffren men 
to grope and to touche hem; 
and Ʒif þey comen not among men, 
þei ben wilde and fleeþ touching and companye of men. 
Þanne as we seen in oþere beestes, 
we fynden in wymmen. 
Þanne Ʒif wymmen strayen not noþer 
ben vsed to companye of men 
but þei ben vsed to be out of companye of men as wilde bestes, 
þanne hem is þe lothere to falle to lecherie. 
Þanne generalliche alle citeseyns 
and wel more noble men 
and gentil 
and namelich kynges and princes schulde haue þe more charge of here 
douƷtres þat here douƷtres straye nouƷt and goo aboute, 
for of vnchastite and lecherie of hire 
douƷtres may most euel and perel falle. Chapter XX 
As it is iseid tofore, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
þe philosofer preyseþ 
in wymmen loue of besynesse. 
And by þre weyes we may preue 
þat it is semelich 
þat alle citeseyns and namelich gentil men an[d] noble 
and most principaliche kynges and princes 
ben so besy to rewle here douƷtres 
þat þei be not idel, 
but þat here douƷtres loue to be besy 
in good woork and honest. 
Þe firste is itake by honoste solace 
þat comeþ þerof, 
þe seconde by euel besynesse 
þat is iput of þerby, 
þe þridde by good fruyt 
þat comeþ þerof. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For, | x Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer meneþ 
þat oure lyf 
may not dure wiþoute al manere likynge, 
for to oure lif nedeþ 
som manere likynge. 
Þerfore þey ben iblamed þat menen 
þat lykyng scholde be forsake. 
Þanne for we may not wel dure in þis lif 
but we haue likynge 
in som thinges, 
it is semelich 
þat we vse som goode workes 
and honest in þe whiche we may haue good likyng and honeste. 
Þanne for men scholde not be idel, 
þei scholde vse goode workes 
and honest for to haue likynge 
þerinne and be occupied in cyuyle doynge 
þat longeþ to þe rewelyng of a regne oþer of hous 
oþer in som oþer good workes and honeste. 
Also for wymmen scholde not be idel, 
þei scholde louye besynesse and doo goode workes and honest, 
for alle men hauen likyng 
in here owne dedes 
and alle men and wymmen louen here owne workes 
as þe philosofer meneþ, 
iiii Ethicorum. 
For wymmen scholde haue likynge and solace 
in som good likynge and honeste, 
it is semelich 
þat þei ben ioccupied 
and besy 
in goode workes and honest; 
and þat is more spedful for wymmen þan for men 
in so moche as wymmen hauen more lacke of resoun þan men 
and cunne not lyue 
but þei haue likynge 
in som sencible doynge. 
And what maner workes 
wymmen scholde vse it schal be declared in þe processe. 
Þe seconde wey for to preue 
þe.same is itake 
by puttyng of of euel besynesse. 
For comynlich wymmen and namliche Ʒonge wenches ben at home 
and not ioccupied 
in ciuel doyng noþer 
in rewlyng of þe comynte. 
But manis þouƷt can not be idel 
as it is iseide tofore, 
anon as man 
is not occupied in good doyng, 
his thouƷt passeþ aboute and | is occupied 
in euel workes and doyng. 
And þat is worse in wemmen þan in men 
and in so moche 
as þei ben more 
vnstable þan men 
and in so moche as þei ben sonnere drawe þanne men 
by euel þouƷtes to mysdo in dede Ʒif þei hauen ese in tyme. 
Þe þridde wey is itake by good fruyt þat comeþ þerof. 
For neuere wymmen mow Ʒeue hemself to goode workes 
but þerof come sum good and profit of outward work 
oþer som good disposicioun of inward work 
oþer of þe soule, 
þerfore it is besiliche to chargynge 
þat wymmen ben good and vertuous. 
Þerfore, primo Rethoricorum, 
þe philosofer dispiseth Lacedemones, 
men of þe countre þat hatte Lacedemonia, 
and seith þat þes men ben nyƷ vngracious for þei be not besye how here douƷtres scholde be vertuous. 
Þanne nedeþ besynesse 
þat wymmen be not idel 
but þat þei be besi 
in goode workes and honeste so 
þat þerof may corae good fruyt and profit, 
and wymmen may þerby be good and vertuous. 
And Ʒif me axen what workes 
wymmen scholde worche, 
it nedeþ in suche matiere speke diuersliche 
as þe persones ben dyuerse. 
Wevynge and spynnynge of selk semeþ workes of acordynge to wymmen. 
But Ʒif a womman scholde leme in oþere gre oþer in ooþer state so 
þat þei schold not do suche werkes, 
oþer Ʒif it were not þe manere of þe contre þat wymmen scholde vse suche workes – git þei scholde not be idel 
but þei scholde be sette to scole and lerne lettere 
and not be idel 
but þei scholde be occupied 
in redyng of bookes. 
And here it is declared 
þat we lefte whanne we treted of rewelyng of wedlok, 
for þere it was iseid 
þat afterward it scholde be | 
declared what workes wymmen scholde worche. Chapter XXI 
It is declared þat Ʒonge wenches scholde not goo astrayng aboute, 
and now it is to declarynge 
þat þei scholde be stille withoute grete ianglyng; 
and þat we may preue 
by þre maner weyes. 
Þe firste is itake 
for þei scholde seme 
þe more ornate and semelich 
and for þei scholde be 
þe more iloued of here housebondis. 
Þe seconde, 
for þei scholde not speke vnwislich and vnwarlich. 
Þe þridde, 
for <þai suld not be enclined to chydyng> 
and <to> stryf. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For desire is of thyng 
þat lakkeþ and, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þe philosofer seith þe more hard 
it is to come to a thing 
þat may be had, þe more lacke is þerof 
and þe more it meueþ þe desire to come þerto. 
Þanne Ʒif a womman is ful of ianglyng, 
sche makeþ hereself 
to hoomeliche and makeþ men telle þe lasse pris of here. 
Þerfore, primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat ornament of wymmen is silens; 
for Ʒif wymmen ben þewelich stille, 
for in þat wise þei ben not to hoomliche noþer to companable 
but þei seme þe more absent 
and þe more hard to come to, 
and þerfore þei ben not despised noþer 
so litel itold of 
but þei ben þe more desired and iloued. Þanne for eche man semeþ 
þat þyng þat he loueth is faire, 
Ʒif wymmen ben stille þei ben þe more iloued and semeþ 
þerfore þe more semeliche and faire. 
Þanne fro childhood mayde children schulde lurne to be stil. 
And Ʒif þei 
h[a]ue afterward [housebonde], 
here housebonde schal loue hem Ʒif they bene stille 
in þew manere wiþoute to greet iangelyng. 
Þe seconde wey to preue þe same is itake 
by voydynge of vnware spekyng. 
For it is iseid tofore | 
þat alwey þere most myshappe may falle nedeþ most to be waar. 
Þanne for a man spekeþ wisliche and warliche by cause of wisdom and of wit, 
þe more lacke a persone hath of resoun 
þe more it happeth hym to speke vnwarliche. 
Þanne for wymmen 
hauen more lacke of vse of resoun 
þan men and Ʒonge wenches more 
þan olde wymmen, 
it is soth þat aboute wymmen 
and namlich aboute Ʒong wenches scholde be greet besynesse 
þat þei speke not vnwarliche. 
And among oþere cauteles 
to be war of vnwar spekynge þis semeþ þe gretteste: 
þat þei speke no word boute besy avisement. 
Þe þridde wey to preue 
þe same is itake for þei scholde not be inclined to chydynge and to stryf. 
Whanne wymmen and namlyche Ʒong wenches lacken vse of resoun, 
but þei be stille in þew manere withoute iangelyng [and] 
but þei avise hem besyliche what wordes 
þei scholde speke 
as for þe defaute of resoun 
þei mowe sone speke wordes 
þat perteynen not to honest doynge 
and to wysdom, 
so þei mowe sone speke wordes 
þat perteyneth to chydynge and to stryf. 
Þanne þei scholde by þewe scilence 
so avise hem what þei speken 
þat þei speken not wordes 
by þe whiche þei myƷt 
be holde vnwys and vnredy, 
noþer þat þei speken wordes to desturble hem 
þat ben present 
by þe whiche þei myöte 
be holde lewede and scoldys; 
wherfore it is semelich 
þat þei ben stille. 
For þei scholde not speke wordes of chidyng and of stryf, 
wymmen scholde principaliche 
be waar of wordes and of strif. 
Þanne for besy avisement 
may not stonde 
by greet iange|lynge, 
for wymmen scholde fro childhod lerne 
to speke wise wordes and ware, 
it is semelich þat þei vse not greet iangelyng; 
but þei moot be þewliche stille 
þat þei mowe besyliche avise 
hem what þei scholde speke. 
For after þat þei bygynnen to chide, 
þei cunnen not absteyne hem 
for hem lackeþ vse of resoun 
by þe whiche euel wille and stryf is refrayned. 
Þerfore after þat þat þei ben imeued 
and bygynneþ to chide, 
here yuel wel to stryue and chide 
is more and more. 
And þerfore þei mowe not ben sone refrayned 
for hem lackeþ vse of resoun and lyuen comynliche more 
by passioun þan by resoun. Book II Part III DOI: 10.4324/9781315861739-120 
Þat þe rewelyng of hous longeþ 
not onlich to tretyng of seruantes 
but also of thinges 
þat helpeþ 
at bodiliche nede and þat þes twey maters ben annexed. 
Þat instrumentes [of] reweli[n]ge of hous scholde be distingwed 
and how þei ben ilikned eche to oþer. 
What maner buldynge kynges and princes [scholde haue] 
and gen- eralliche alle citeseins in crafti work and temporat eire. 
What maner buldynge scholde be touchinge good water 
and þe place of þe worlde. 
That possessioun 
is som del kyndeliche to man 
and þat þei þat forsaken possessioun 
lyuen not as men 
but as þei 
þat ben bettre þan men. 
Þat it is good in politik lif in laweful comynte þat citeseyns haue propre possessions. 
How outward good scholde be vsed 
and what maner of leuynge is laweful. 
Þat citeseyns and wel more kynges and prynces scholde not desire endelees greet possessioun. 
How many maneres þer ben of chaungyng | 
and of biggynge and sellynge 
and what nede it was to fynde money. 
How manye maners þer ben of moneye 
and whiche þerof is good 
and whiche is euel. 
Of þe ferþe maner of money 
þat hatte takos 
and is euel; 
and þat kynges and princes, 
Ʒif þei wol be kyndelich lordes, 
scholde forbede vserye for it 
is contrarie to kynde lawe. 
Þat þer be dyuers maners 
of wynnyng of money 
and somme þerof acorden to kynges and princes. 
Þat som men ben kyndeliche seruantes 
and þat it is spedful 
to som men 
to be soget to oþer. 
Þat al wiþoute kyndeliche seruage, 
þat is as it were seruage of itself, 
is laweful seruage 
and is as it were by myƷt. 
Þat al wiþoute kynde and laweful 
þraldom and seruice 
is seruice for huyre and for loue. 
How in hous of kynges and princes offis scholde be take to to seruantes. 
How kynges and princes scholde ordeyne clothinge for seruantes. 
What is curtesie and þat seruantes of kynges and of princes scholde be courteys. 
How kynges and princes scholde haue hemself to here seruantes. 
Þat þei þat sitten at noble menne boord scholde not vse greet ian-gelyng noþer be to fol of tales. Chapter I 
Twey parties of þe seconde book 
ben isped in þe whiche it is itreted of rewlyng of hous, 
for it is declared how men scholde rewle here wifes and fadres here sones, 
and now it is to spekyng of þe þridde partye in þe whiche it is | 
itreted of rewelyng of seruantes 
and of oþer maynye 
as it schal be iknowe in þe proces. 
Þat mater may be turned 
in þe whiche it is 
itreted of thinges 
þat helpeþ 
at bodilich nede 
and to sauacioun of þe lif; 
and suche thinges ben faire buldyng 
in manye, hous, and moneye, 
and oþer possessioun and richesse. 
Þanne in þis þridde partie of þis book, 
for þes matiers ben annexed, 
we schul teche hem 
þat wollen weel rewle here hous not onlich in rewelyng of seruantes and of maynye 
but also in rewelyng of oþere thinges 
þat ben iordeyned for sauacioun of lif 
and for suffisaunt lif 
and also of thinges 
þat helpeþ at bodiliche nede. 
Þanne in þis partie of þis seconde book we schal trete 
how faire houses kynges and prynces 
and alle citeseins scholde haue 
and how þei scholde rewle here posses- sions and moneye and seruantes and maynye. 
And a wis housebonde and redy 
and a redy rewelere of mayne scholde take hede of alle þese 
and þat þis matirs ben anexed, 
as it is iseid in þe bygynnyng of þe chapitre. 
And þat a wise rewelere scholde take heede of alle þese 
þe philosofer 
preueth at þe folle, primo Poleticorum, 
and preueþ by twey resons 
þat an housebonde 
and a rewelere of mayne scholde take hede of possessions 
as of hous, of maynye, 
of araye and stoor of hous, 
and of oþere thinges 
þat helpen at bodilich nede and to þis partie 
in þe whiche it is itreted of rewelyng of seruantes 
and of oþer maynye. 
Þe firste resoun is itake 
by suffisaunt lif; 
þe seconde, 
by liknesse of craft of rewelyng of hous and of oþere craftes. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For craft | of rewelyng of hous is itauƷt, 
for an housebonde 
þat schal wel rewle an hous scholde be besy aboute thinges 
þat holden þe lyf 
and helpen to suffisaunt lif; 
wherfore 10 Ʒif hous, 
possessions and money ben nedful 
to lyue poletik lif, 
he þat is a rewelere of hous 
scholde take heede of suche thinges. 
Þe seconde wey to preue þe same, 
as þe philosofer meneþ þere, 
is itake by liknesse of craft of rewelyng of hous 
and of oþere craftes. 
For as oþere craftes 
as smeþes craft and webbe craft 
hauyng here toles and instrumentis 
by þe whiche þei doun here workes, 
so rewelyng of hous neden instrumentis 
by þe whiche it may wel rewle. 
Þanne he þat wol teche connynge of smythes craft 
mot trete of þe hamer and annefeld 
and of oþere smethes instrumentes; 
and a smyth moot knowe suche instrumentes. 
So þat he þat wol teche weuyng craft 
mot trete of þe lathe, 
of þe slay, 
and of þe heuel, 
and of þe tredel 
and of oþer instrumentes of þat craft; 
and a webbe mot knowe suche instrumentƷ. Werfore he þat wol recche of rewelyng of hous mot trete of buldyng of possessioun 
and of moneye for suche ben þe instrumentes of þis craft. 
Þanne he þat reweleþ 
an hous mot knowe suche thinges, 
for þerby as his owne instrumentes 
he may come to thinges 
þat nedeþ to suffi- sant lif. 
For craft of rewelyng of hous haþ his owne instrumentes 
as oþere craftes of handwerk 
hauen here owne instrumentes, 
but þe instrumentes ben diuerse 
as þe philososfer meneþ, primo Poleticorum. 
For instrumentes of rewelyng of hous stondeþ 
in redy doynge 
and 30 instrumentes of craft of hondwerk stondeþ in | makyng of thinges. 
For in worchinge of hondwork 
we ben irewled by craft, 
and in rewelyng of hous 
oure rewle is redinesse 
þat hatte prudencia. 
Þanne as craft is oþer þan prudencia, 
so instrumentes of crafti hondwork ben oþere þanne instrumentes 
of rewelyng of hous. 
And craft and redinesse 
þat hatte prudencia ben diuerse, 
for craft is resoun of riƷt þynges 
þat ben imaad; 
for by craft is som what imaad in mater withoute. 
But redinesse þat hatte prudencia 
is riƷt resoun of doynge, 
for þerby is not imaad properliche 
in matier withoute but þerof comeþ som inward doynge and inward perfeccioun in hym 
þat is rewelere. 
Also instrumentes of crafty hondwerk serueþ to make thinges, 
for þei ben instrumentes of craft 
þat is of þinges 
þat ben imaad; 
but instrumentes of rewelyng of hous serueþ to redy doyng, 
for þei ben instrumentis of prudencia 
þat reweleth redy doynge. 
Þanne craft [is] of rewelyng of hous, 
Ʒif it myƷt be cleped craft largelich for to speke; 
but properliche it scholde be cleped prudencia. 
By þe twey forseide resons 
it is declared 
at þe folle 
þat rewelers of hous 
scholde take hede of buldyng and of money and of possessions 
þat helpeþ to sauacioun of lif 
and to suffisant lif. 
Also by þe same resons 
it may be preued 
þat þe rewelere of hous schulde kunne haue hymself 
wel to seruantes and to mayne, 
for seruantes ben certein in- strumentes 
and serueþ 
to þe rewelyng of hous. 
And so þe firste partie 
of þe chapitre is declared 
w<h>ere it was iseid 
þat þe rewelere of hous 
scholde take heede of seruan|‡tes and of thinges 
þat helpeth at bodiliche nede. 
And þat þes tweye maters [ben] annexed 
and þat tretyng of buldynge and of possessions scholde be annexed 
to þe tretes 
in þe whiche it is itreted of mynstres 
and of seruantes 
it may be sone iknowe. 
For possessions, hous and moneye ben instrumentes of rewlyng of hous. 
Þanne eche seruant is a certeyn instrument 
and eche instrument is a certeine seruant, 
for þe philosofer seith þat an instrument 
is a certeyne vnsouled seruant 
and a seruant is a certeyn [souled] instrument. 
Þanne for an instrument 
and a seruant acordeþ in þis wise, 
þese twey maters ben wel icoupled ifere. Chapter II Primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer makeþ a distinccioun of twey membres 
of alle þe instrumentes 
of rewlyng of hous, 
and seith þat som ben isouled as seruantes 
and som vnsowled as possessioun, money, cloþynge and oþere 
suche 
þat serueþ at nede. 
And þe philosofer seith, primo Poleticorum, 
þat as we seen in oþere craftes, 
so it mot be in rewelyng of hous. 
And in other craftes 
is þe double instrument, 
souled and vnsouled. 
As in craft of rewelyng of schip þe roþer 
is as it were an vnsouled instru- ment 
and so is þe helme and ores, 
and souled instrumentes ben rowers, 
so in rewelyng of hous vnsowled instrumentes 
ben clothinge, beddes, possessioun and money; 
and mynystres and seruantes ben as it were souled instrumentes. 
Þanne alle suche instrumentes acordeþ, 
for eche of hem is possessioun in som wise. 
But þei ben diuerse, 
for som ben souled 
and som v[n]souled. 
| For it is declared how instrumentes [of] rewelyng of hous ben distin- gwed, 
it is to tretynge how þei ben iordeyned. 
For þe philosofer seith þat such instrumentes 
mot ben iordeyned ifere so þat on instrument be tofore anoþer 
as þe instrument with soule 
mot be tofore þe instru- ment withoute soule. 
And for company of houses is kyndelich 
and in kyndelich þynges ‡ 
al þynges ben iordeyned and alwey þe nether ben iserued by þe ouere and fongeþ 
of hem manere and mesure, 
also [instrumentes of rewlyng of hous 
mot be ordeyned so 
þat þe nethere instrumentes 
þat ben wiþoute soule be imeued 
and iserued by þe ouere instrumentes 
þat ben with soule. 
And, primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer declareth this 
by liknesse of oþere craftes, 
and seith þere þat for þe wrest harpeþ 
not by itself 
noþer combes kymben bi hemself, 
þerfore for to harpe þe wrest nedeþ 
a seruant to meue it and so nedeþ 
þe combes for to kembe. 
But as he seith Ʒif wrestes harpen by hemself 
and Ʒif kombes kymben by hemself, 
chef craftes men nedeþ no mynystres 
noþer lordes nedede seruantes. 
Þerfore chef craftes men and lordes neden mynystres and seruantes and souled instrumentes, 
for soule[s] instrumentes 
mowe not by hemself 
do þe office 
þat þei ben imaad fore. 
For Ʒif trestles 
and met bordes of kynges 
and of princes were suche as þe trestles 
þat were in a certein temple, 
as fables meneþ, 
for thilke tresteles putte hemself 
to Goddes seruice 
by here owne wille, 
and Ʒif alle instrumentes of hous 
were suche as was Dedalus his image 
(of þe whiche ymage þe 
philoso|fer reherseth a fable [in] Poletidis], 
for by itself þat image dede goode workes) 
and Ʒif alle instrumentes dede so, 
þanne nedede noon oþere instrument, 
but mete bordes wolde araye hemself 
and whanne it were tyme Ʒates and dores scholde opene and close hemself. 
But for it is not so 
but for soulets] instrumentes 
mowe not meue hemself, 
þerfore lordes and cheef craftes 
men nedeþ mynestres and seruantes to moue by here 
rewelyng soules instru- mentes and instrumentes 
þat konneþ no resoun to do here workes. 
And it is vnworthi 
by þe ordre of þe world 
þat þe heyeste scholde wiþoute mene serue þe lowest, 
but it is þe lawe of þe hoole worlde 
þat þe heigheste serue þe loweste by mene. 
Þe heyƷeste þat is in eche doyng ben chef craftes 
men and lordes 
and þe lowest ben soules instrumentes, 
and þe mene ben mynystres and seruantes 
þat ben as it were certein instrumentes. 
And it is not semelich þat lordes and cheef craftes 
men araye mete bordes 
by hemself noþer by vscheres noþer porters noþer oþere suche officers, 
but it is semelich þat þei doun suche office by mene seruantes. 15 20 f. 104r 25 30 
Þanne in a parfit hous bothe instrumentis ben nedful: souled and soules. 
And how þei schulde be ordeyned togeders 
it is declared by thinges 
þat ben iseid, 
for þe souled scholde be serued 
by þe soules 
and aƷenward 
and be imeued 
to do here owne workes. Chapter III 
By þe forsaide proces 
it may be knowe þat in þis þridde partie of þe seconde book 
it is to spekynge bothe of seruantes 
and of thinges 
þat serueþ to sauacioun | of lyf 
and to suffisant lif; 
and þynges þat serueþ 
to sauacioun of lif 
and to suffisant lif ben distingwed 
a þre as buldyng, possessioun and money. 
Þanne it is to spekynge of foure: 
for first, 
it schal be declared 
what manere hous 
and habitacioun kynges and princes 
and alle citeseyns scholde haue; 
þe seconde, 
it schal be treted of possessions; 
þe þridde, of moneye; 
þe ferþe, of seruantes. 
Among oþere þat scholde be knowe in buldynge, 
as Paladius seith in libro De Agricultura, 
is crafty work so 
þat þe buldynge 
be craftyliche and wel imaad and temporate eyre so 
þat it stonde in good eyre. 
And þat kynges and princes scholde haue wonder hous and craftiliche imaad 
þe philosofer preueþ 
by twey resons. 
Þe firste is itake by magnificencia of a kyng. 
Þe seconde, 
by þe puple; 
and we may putte to þe þridde resoun, 
by seruantes and mayne. 
Þe firste is declared in þis wise. 
iiii Ethicorum, 
capitulo De Magni- ficencia, 
þe philosofer seith þat he 
þat is most glorious and noble 
scholde be magnificus 
and kynges and princes scholde be most glorious and noble. 
Þanne it is most semelich 
þat a kyng oþer a prince be magnificus 
and oþere þat hauen 
but mene richesse mowe be liberal for liberalite 
may be in mene spense and cost. 
But kynges and princes 
þat haue greet possessioun and richesse scholde be magnifici and eche of hem magnificus for magnificencia stondeþ in greet spence and cost. 
But as it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum, magnificus scholde make semelich housyng 
and it is not semelich housyng for hym 
þat is magnificus 
but it be wonder|liche and craftyliche imaad. 
Þanne by magnificencia of a kyng 
it is preued 
þat kynges and princes scholde haue housynge wonder- liche and craftyliche ymaad. 
And oþere citeseyns scholde haue hous-ynge more crafiy oþer lasse crafty accordyng to here owne richesse and catel. 15 20 f. 104v 25 
Þe seconde wey to preue þe same is itake by þe puple, 
and þe philosofer, vi Poleticorum, 
toucheþ þis resoun and seith 
þat a prince scholde make grete workes 
and suche housynge 
þat þe puple 
þat seen it scholde be 
as it weere astonyed for gret wonder, 
for þe puple is þe lothere to arise aƷenste a prince Ʒif þei seen 
þat þe prynce 
is so magni- ficus. 
Magnificus is he 
þat makeþ greet workes and eche of þe peple, 
Ʒif þei seen þat he is so greet magnificus, 
troweþ þat he is so grete 
þat it is 
as it were inpossible to ouersette hym, 
and for of thing þat is inposcible 
is no choys nother consaille and reed 
as þe philosofer meneþ, iii Ethicorum, 
eche of þe puple wiþdraweþ hym 
and dar not make conspiracie 
aƷenst þe prince for þey seen 
þat he is so greet and so magnificus. 
Þe greet buldyng scholde not be made for boost and veyn glorie, 
Ʒut for þe puple scholde not telle litel of hem 
it is semelich þat kynges and princes make grete housynge 
as heere astaat axeth. 
Þe þridde wey is itake by mayne and seruantes; 
for where moche richesse is, 
þer ben manye 
þat eten þerof. 
Þan in hous of kynges and princes 
mot be manye seruantes; 
þanne not onlich for kynges and princes 
but also manye seruantes mowe | wel dwelle togedres 
in hous-yng of kyng and prynce, 
þe housyng mot be solempne and greet. 
For it is iknow what maner 
þe housyng scholde be touching greet work and craft, 
it is to wetyng 
in what place þei scholde stonde to haue good eyre and temporat. 
And Paladius, 
in þe book of erthe telyng, 
toucheth thre bi þe whiche we may knowe 
in what eire þe housynge scholde stonde and seiþ first, 
þat in lowe valeys 
is not holsom 
eire for Ʒif housynge stonde 
in lowe valeys 
for þe eire is þicke 
by cause of þe hulles 
þat stonden aboute 
and is not holsome. 
And we schal imagine in þis wise 
þat as rennyng water 
is [more] holsom þan stondyng water, 
for commonliche stondyng water 
wexe thikke and roteþ, 
so þe eire closed in valeyes ‡ 
for it 
hath not fre meuyng it wexeth thikke þerfore 
and is not holsom; 
þanne for holsom 
eire me scholde take hede 
þat suche housyng be not ibuld in þe lowest valeys. 
Þe seconde, 
it is to takynge heede 
þat þe place in þe whiche suche housyng scholde be arered be cleene withoute derkenesse of myst; 
for in som place of þe erþe 
by cause of mareys oþer for som oþer disposi- cioun þe eire is ofte iderked by myst 
and vapores more þanne in oþere place, 
wherfore þere þe eyre 
is not holsom and þerfore Ʒif 
it may bettre bee suche housynge scholde not be ibuld þere. 
Þe þridde, 
by þe whiche good eire is iknowe, 
we scholde take heede of þe men 
þat dwellen þerinne, 
and Ʒif we wolde bulde in eny place, 
Ʒif men wonyen þeraboute we | schal take hede of here bodyes, 
Ʒif þei hauen good colour and faire, 
Ʒif þei ben hool withoute heed ache, 
Ʒif þei hauen scharp siƷt 
and good hurynge and cleer voice; 
for by alle þes goode eire is iknowe 
and by þe contrarie vnholsom eire is iknowe. 
For Ʒif men þat wonyen þere ben sike, 
Ʒif þei hauen not good colour 
but Ʒolwe colour, 
Ʒif þei hauen heed ache, 
Ʒif here sight be desturbled 
and huryng not good 
and þe voice hoos, 
by alle þese and by certeyns tokenes and signes 
†of good eire and clene†. f. 105r 25 30 Chapter IV Passynge thes twey – crafty work and temporate 
eire – tweyne oþere mot be knowe in buldyng: 
hoolsom water and good disposicioun of þe world. 
Þe philosofer seith þat water is comyn and nedful to þe lif in meny maner wise. 
Þerfore it nedeþ to knowe 
þat housynge scholde stonde so þat it haue water inowƷ good and holsom lest men 
þat wonyen þerinne take sekenesse 
for defaute of water 
oþer by infeccioun þerof. 
And Paladius, 
in libro De Agricultura, 
toucheþ sexe 
þat moste be iknowe 
for to knowe hoolsom water. 
Þe firste, 
þat water come not out of mores 
and mareys and ploddes, 
for comonliche in mores and mareys 
is stondynge water and vnholsom. 
Þe seconde, 
þe water scholde not springe out of metal 
noþer passe by veynes of metal. 
For vnder erþe ben veynes of metal 
and water 
is igendred 
vnder erþe and passe by veynes vnder erþe, 
wherfore Ʒif water is igendred among veynes of metal 
and passeth by veynes of metal, 
þerby þe water is infecte 
and is not ful holsom. 
For it is moyst and nesche and apeyreth sone 
and is þerfore sone 
infecte of metal 
and | nameliche of veynes of metal 
where þe metal 
is not clene 
and pure but imedled 
with som roted thinges. 
Þe þridde 
þat mot be knowe in water is þat it be clere and of faire colour, 
for vnparfit colour 
is tokene of inperfeccioun of the watir. 
Þe ferþe, 
þat it haue not euel sauoure 
oþer euel smel, 
for comynliche euel sauoure oþer euel smel of water is tokene 
þat þat water is igendred 
oþer passeth by places 
þat ben infecte and taken smel and sauoure þerof. 
Þe fifte, 
þat no slyme be in þe water 
for slymy ground 
is infecte and þerfore it 
ne may not be holsom. 
Þanne of þis fyue fenny maners 
it is to takyng heede in holsom water; 
and for men may be som tyme 
bygyled by þes signes, 
Paladius bryngeþ forþ 
þe sexte singne and tokenynge 
þat we schulde hede of and seith 
þat we schulde take hede of disposicioun of bodies of hem þat vsen þat water. 
Þan we schulde take hede Ʒif here teþe and tonges ben clene, 
Ʒif here heedes be wiþoute ofte hede ache, 
Ʒif here wombe oþer gottes and bowels 
oþer sides and reynes aken oþer swellen, 
for ofte alle þes euels oþer som of hem comen of malis of water. 
Þanne housyng schulde be bulde in a place 
þere it may haue inowƷ of holsom water 
with þe condicions of þe whiche we hauen imaad mencioun. 
But Ʒif nede dryueth to bulde 
where þat holsom water lackeþ, 
Paladius seith 
þat we schulde make a cisterne, 
as it were a manere deep welle oþer a put to gadry water 
of reyn þerinne, 
for he seith þat reyn water 
is as it w[ere] best of waters to drynke. 
And in þat cisterne scholde fresch water fisch be do 
þat by here swymmyng þe stondyng water 
may be meued 
and som del liche to rennyng water. 
For it is iseie how housyng schulde be buld touching holsom water, 
it is to wetyng 
how it schulde be ibuld touching þe ordre of [þe worldle. 
And as it nedeþ to bildyng 
in þe ordre of þe world, 
þre mot be knowe: 
þe condicioun of heuene, diuerse wyndes, 
and disposicioun of groundes. 
And touchinge þe condicioun of heuene tweyne mote be iknowe; 
first, 
þat it haue ÜƷt inow in wynter. 
Þe seconde, 
þat it haue not to grete heet in somer, 
and þat may be Ʒif 
þe largere side of þe housynge 
is toward þe sone risyng in wynter. 
Þanne for it is aforne þe sonne in wynter, 
it haþ liƷt ynow. 
And in somer for it stondeþ aslont toward þe southe, 
þei scholde haue temporat heete; 
for of a sonne beem 
þat goþ aslont comeþ 
lasse heete þanne of þe beem þat passeth streiƷt. 
Þe seconde, 
in buldyng of hous 
dyuersete of wynd scholde be iknow, 
and þat touchyng diuerse chambres. 
For þe northerne wynd makeþ þe eire þe more pure 
and þerfore þe eire is more holsom. 
Þanne by cause of somer tyme 
in þe whiche men eueleth faste, 
summe chambres scholde be bulde 
afome þe northeme wynd 
to kepe þerinne þe lif 
in þe more heele. 
Þe þridde touching þe ordre of þe world, 
þe disposicioun of grondes 
mot be knowe so 
þat housynge ben bulde in a place 
þat may be nyƷ erbers and orchardes, 
for siƷt þerof and wandryng and walkyng þerinne helpeþ 
to gladnesse and to heele. 
And in buldyng of oþere hous sum oþere thing scholde be iseid, 
as what manere hous þe wyne seler scholde be; 
for he scholde be derk and cold 
and afome þe north and scholde also be feer 
fro waters and cistemes and reueres 
and fer fro stablees| 
and ovenes and dunge hulles. 
Also oþer particuler condicions of housynge myƷte be distingwed, 
but suche ben to particuler 
and ben þerfore iset 
to þe avisement of bulders. Chapter V It is itreted of housynge 
in þe ordre 
þat is iseid tofore, 
and it is to tretyng of possessions. 
And by þre weyes we may declare þat possessioun of thinges 
is in som wise kyndelich to man. 
Þe ñrste wey is itake 
by nede of lif. 
Þe seconde, 
by worthinesse of man. 
Þe þridde, 
by worch-ynge of kynde. 
Ʒif man kyndeliche [ljeuen, 
and politik comynte is in som wise kyndeliche to man 
as it is declared in ‡ þe firste partie of þis ii book, 
in som wise sum kyndelich thinges 
mot be nedful in politik lif. 
And, [i] Polethicorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
[þat possessioun of þynges 
is nedful to rewlyng of hous, 
Ʒif man scholde lyue in politik maner, 
þanne þerby he seith] 
þat possessioun of þynges 
is nedful to þe lif 
and is in som wise kyndelych. 
Þe seconde wey to preue þe same is itake by worthinesse of man. 
For by cause þat among bodilich 
and sencible creatures of God man is most worthi and hath þerfore kynde lordschipe ouer oþer creatures, 
wherfore it is kyndeliche to man 
to haue lordschipe 
ouer þes sencible thinges 
and to haue hem 
to his owne vse and seruyce. And for in som wise 
þat is to haue possessioun of hem, 
þerfore possessioun þerof is kyndelich to man. 
And so, primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer preueth þat suche possession 
is kyndelich and seith þat men hauen kyndeliche riƷtful werre aƷenst bestes, 
for bestes scholde be soget to man 
and be iordeined to seruice of man. 
Ʒif bestis fleeþ 
þe seruice of man, 
man fiƷteþ and werreþ aƷenst hem 
as aƷenst þilke of þe whiche man haþ kynde lordschipe. 
Þanne in þis wise man haþ kynde lordschipe of beestes, 
and also of oþere outward þynges. 
And it were not | so but possessioun of thinges 
were in som wise kyndelich. 
Þe þridde wey is itake 
by worchinge of kynde. 
For in þe firste gener- 
acioun kynde failleþ 
not in beestes 
but arayethe for hem þew norsching, 
it is skilful 
þat kynde faille hem not 
whanne þei ben parfit. 
For parfit thinges ben more worthi 
þan inparfit þynges and kynde ordeyn- 
en mete and noresching for hem 
while þei ben vnparfit, 
þanne moche more þei scholde ordeyne for hem 
whanne þei ben parfit. 
For som beestes leggen eyren 
and som bryngen forþ here 
brood alyue and ful ischape. 
And in beestes þat leggen eyrene 
as in bryddes and foules 
kynde ordeynen in þe eyren white and golke so þat of þe white 
þe bryd is igendred and ifed wiþ þe Ʒolke. 
And so kynde failleþ not wiþinne 
þe schille of þe eiƷ 
but ordeyneþ norsching for þe brydde. 
Also in bestes 
þat ben igendred withoute eirene, 
kynde failleth not to ordeyne fedyng and norsching. 
For anon kynde is besy to ordeyne melk 
in þe moder pappes and tyttes þat bestes 
þat comen forþ 
may be fed þerwiþ. 
Wherfore Ʒif kynde ordeyne norschinge 
to vnparfit beestes and thinges 
þat nedeþ to þe lif, moche more he ordeyneþ 
to parfit beestes. 
Þerfore, primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat outward thinges 
ben iƷeue to vs 
by þe whiche we ben ifed 
and possessioun of outward þynges 
is graunted to vs. 
Þanne lordschipe of outward thinges 
is som del kyndelich to man for kynde bryngeth forþ 
sencible thinges 
by cause of man. 
And so we ben þe ende of al thinges 
as it is iseid, 
ii Phisicorum. 
| Þanne he þat forsakeþ suche thinges 
and casteþ to lyue 
withoute lordschipe of outward thinges 
casteþ not to lyue as a man 
but cheseth heuenliche lif and aboue mankynde; 
as wedloc and getyng of children 
is kyndelich good to man, 
Ʒut som men casten to doo more good and forsaken wedloc. 
And as it is iseid tofore, 
suche lyuen not as men noþer ben partie of a citee 
but þei chesen hem 
a lyf aboue men 
and scholde be cleped betere þan men. 
Þanne it is kyndelich to man 
in þat þat he is a man 
as þe philosofer meneþ, primo Poleticorum, 
to haue possessioun and lordschipe of oþere outward thinges for suffisant lif. 
Þanne as kynde Ʒeueþ lif to man, 
so kynde makeþ beestes, trees and herbes, 
for man scholde haue lord- schipe and poossessioun 
þerof 
and for þei scholde haue þew fedyng þerof 
withoute þe whiche oure life may not dure. Chapter VI 
It was þe oppinyoun of Socrates and of Plato 
as þe philosofer reherseth, [ii] Poleticorum, 
þat it were good and spedful to a citee 
þat citeseyns hadde no propre possessions 
and Ʒif alle thinges were comyne to hem; 
and Ʒut worse for þei wolde 
þat wyues and children scholde be comyne. 
For Socrates and his disciple Plato seide þat Ʒif no man hadde his owne propre wif 
but þat eche man scholde take eche womman 
at his owne wille, 
þanne scholde be most vnyte and loue in þe citee for þanne alle men wolde loue alle wymmen 
as here owne wyues. 
And also alle men wolde loue al children 
as here owne children for men 
schold not knowe whiche were here owne children, 
as þe fader scholde not iknowe whiche were here owne children 
but wene þat al children 
were his owne children 
[and] loue al children 
as here | owne children. 
In þis wise Socrates and Plato wolde mene. 
Withinne þe þridde book 
where we schal trete of rewelyng of citees, 
þis opynyoun schal be more playneliche itreted; 
and here it is inow to wete 
what is to doynge of possession of outward thinges 
in so moche 
as it helpeþ 
to rewelynge of hous. 5 f.106v 10 
And Ʒif men hadde not comynlich corupte appetite and desire and Ʒif it were not comonliche inclined to euel, 
it were spedful for a citee 
þat possessions were comyne, 
<for þe more comyne> 
þe good is, 
þe betre it is. 
And Boys seith þat good 
þat is imaad comyne is þe more fayre and cleer. 
But as þe world stondeþ now, 
it is good for a citee 
þat citeseins haue here owne propre possessions. 
For cyuel lyf is lif of comyne men 
and comynliche men 
ben not so parfit 
þat þei wolde be apayed 
to lyue suche a lif. 
And of diuers place [in libro] Poleticorum we may take þre by þe whiche we may declare 
by þre weyes 
þat it is spedful to a cite 
þat citeseins haue here owne propre possessions. 
Þe firste wey is itake 
for to putte away vncurtesie, 
þe seconde to putte away strif, 
þe þridde to putte away euel ordinnaunce 
and schindynge of þe citee. 
Þe firste wey is itake in þis wise. 
For man loueþ hymself so moche þat he careth alwey more 
for his owne profit 
þanne for oþere menne profit. 
For we seen þat in þat wise possessioun 
myƷte be sone destroyed and wasted, 
and it is so hard to trauele 
and to gete proper possessioun 
by proper wynnynge 
þat in þe citee many myƷt happe be nedy 
and pore not withstondynge 
þat citeseins mowe haue here owne possessions 
and ben besy þeraboute 
as aboute here owne good. 
Þanne Ʒif þei hadde not | here owne proper possessioun 
but al in comyn, 
for citeseyns wolde not be so besy to gadre comyne possessions 
as þei ben comynliche 
to gadery here owne, 
þe cite þat were so iordeyned myƷt falle in pouerte and nede so 
þat citeseins myƷt nouƷt be suffisaunt to hemself in leuynge. 
Þan what is not good and profitable alwey is good and profitable in som caas. 
Þan as þe worlde stondeþ now, 
it is gode to a citee 
þat citeseins haue here owne propre possessions ‡ 
lest comyne hous of citeseyns falle in pouerte and nede by vncurtesie and slewþe. Þe seconde wey for to preue þe same is itake 
by remeuyng of strif. 
For comynlich þere is strif and werre bytwene hem 
þat ben partiners and hauen ouƷt in comyn. 
And we seen þat twey breþerne of oo fader, 
bytwene þe whiche is kynde loue 
and frendschipe 
as þe philosofer seith, viii Ethicorum, 
comynliche fiƷten for here comyn heritage. 
Þanne moche more strif scholde be among citeseins 
bytwene þe whiche is not so grete frendschipe Ʒif possessions were comyn to hym. 
Ǟe þridde wey is itake 
by remeuynge of inordinate doynge and confusioun. 
For, ii Poleticorum, þe philosofer seith Ʒif citeseins hadde possessions in comyne, 
it scholde fare as it fareth 
whanne a certeyne doyng 
is commytted to manye seruantes. 
For whanne it is so, 
eche of hem wiþdraweþ hym and doþ not 
as he is ihoot hopynge 
þat another doþ it. 
Þerfore þat thing is not ido oþer 
it is vnordinatliche ido 
oþer wiþ confusioun. 
Þanne for to do awey confusioun 
and inordinat doynge in thinges 
þat ben spedful to a citee, 
it is good þat citeseins haue here owne possessions 
þat feeldes and oþere londes 
þat bereþ fruyt may be tyled 
þe more bysiliche and þe more ordenatliche | 
and wiþoute strif. Chapter VII Primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer declareth þat of diuerse vse of outward thinges 
cometh diuers manere of lyuynge. 
For as we seen in beestes 
þat not alle beestes vsen 
þe same þynges noþer alle beestes hauen 
þe same maner of leuyng 
and so it fareth among men. 
For som bestes lyuen by herbes, 
sum by apples oþer by fruyt, 
and sum by raueyne. 
Þerfore bestes hauen diuerse manere of lyuynge; 
for as þe philosofer meneþ somme lyueþ agalya, 
þat is to menyng in companye, 
and som by hemself and out of companye. 
For alle manere beestes lyuen 
as it is most spedful 
to suffisant lyuynge 
and as þei mowe best gete mete and norisching. 
And also men vseþ outward þynges dyuerseliche 
and not alle men 
hauen þe same manere of leuyng. 
Primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer distingweth foure manere 
of symple leuyng 
of þe whiche by combinacioun comen oþere maneres of leuynge. 
For þer is foure manere of leuynge, 
for som men leuen 
by erþe telyng 
and by tame beestes 
and suche manere of leuyng 
is icleped vita pascualis. 
And som man lyueþ by huntynge and by wilde bestes; 
[and summe lyuen by 
fyschyng;] and summe lyuen by raueyne 
and by þefte. 
And þis manere of leuynge 
may be combyned togedres 
so þat a man may haue twey maners of leuyng oþer mo. 
For som men leuen by erþe tylynge 
and by huntynge, 
and sum by erþe tylynge 
and by fyschyng, 
and sum by huntynge 
and by raueyne 
and by þefte. 
And somme vsen al manere of leuynge 
for som men lyuen 
by erþe telynge 
and by tame beestes, 
by fisching and by huntyng 
and by raueyne. 
And of þis foure | manere of leuynge, [leuynge] by raueyne is vnlaweful 
at al and þe oþere maneres of leuyng mowe be laweful. 
For leuyng by erþe telyng 
and by tame beestes 
as by scheep and oxene and oþere suche is laweful for kynde ordeyneþ hem for þe vse of mankynde. 
For alwaye lasseparfit ben iordeyned for þe more par[fit]; 
as water and erþe [þat] 
ben soules ben iordeyned for norischyng oftreen, herbes and gras 
as þe lasse parfit iordeyned for þe more parfit. 
And treen, herbes and gras 
þat hauen no felyng ben iordeyned for norisching of beestes 
þat hauen felyng; 
and al þese þat ben soules, 
and alle þat hauen soule 
and no felynge, 
and beestes þat hauen soule and felynge 
ben iordeyned for sustinaunce of man. 
Þerfore it is wel iseide, primo Poleticorum, 
þat kynde Ʒeueþ vs suche thinges, 
for kynde ordeyneth hem to oure vse 
and to oure lordschipe. 
Þanne it is laweful 
to take norsching of feldes 
[and] of tame bestes, 
wherfore leuynge 
by erþe telynge 
and by tame bestes is laweful. 
And leuyng of huntynge and fischynge 
is not vnlaweful 
by kynde þerof, 
for by kynde man scholde be lord 
not 
onlich of tame bestes 
but also of wilde bestes and of fische, 
and man haþ aƷenst suche rigtfui werre. 
Þerfore, primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seith þat leuynge 
by huntyng and fisching is laweful, 
for he seith þat man haþ riƷtful werre aƷenst suche beestes. 
And for to speke onliche of þe kynde þerof, 
men mowe take suche beestes 
and ordeyne hem 
to here owne vse. 
And for to speke of kynde of raueyne, 
leuynge by raueyns is vnlaweful, 
for men hauen not by kynde riƷtful werre aƷenst men. 
But Ʒif men hauen riƷtful werre aƷenst men, 
it is | for som happe 
and for som men doun oþer wrong. 
Þan a man doþ wrong 
Ʒif he greueþ 
a man by euel trespace; 
and for to speke of þe kynde of doing, 
‡ man doþ not wrong 
in greuyng of bestes. 
And Ʒif wrong is in greuinge of bestes, 
þat is bi hap, 
for such greef tumith sum man to harme 
þat owiþ þe bestis. f. 107v 25 
But it semeþ 
þat þe philosofer wolde mene that a man hath riƷtfulle werre nouƷt 
oonliche aƷenste bestys 
bute also aƷenste straunge men 
þat ben icalled barbari, 
þat is a stronge nacioun 
and ben as þei it were wilde men. 
And hem lakken vse of resoun and scholde 
þerfore be soget to wis men and redy. 
And it semeth þat he wolde mene þat for wise men 
scholde be kyndelich lordes of nyse men and foles, 
w[er]re is riƷtful aƷenst hem 
Ʒif þei wollen not be soget to wise men and redy. 
And by þis manere of spekyng citeseyns 
þat ben ful wise and redy 
hauen riƷtful werre aƷenst cherles Ʒif þei wollen not be sogettes to hem. 
Þerfore aƷenst suche þat wollen not be soget 
as þei scholde, 
by þe menynge of þe philosofer, 
vnderstondeþ in þis wise: it semeþ 
þat leuyng by raueyne is laweful so þat it were laweful 
not onliche to spoille hem 
and byneme hem 
what þei hauen 
but also to take hem 
in here owne persone. 
But for no man scholde haue wrong 
for to speke of kynde of raueyne, 
leuyng by raveyne 
is acounted vnlaweful 
for a man scholde lyue 
by his owne 
and not byneme oþer menne good. 
Þanne for citeseyns 
and nameliche for kynges and princes schulde lyue vertuous lif, 
Ʒif þei wollen rewle here owne hous, 
[þei] scholde knowe þe maneres of leuynge 
and whiche þerof is laweful and whiche is vnlaweful. 
For no man may lyue vertuousliche Ʒif | 
he vseth vnlawefulliche possessions and outward good. Chapter VIII Comunelich men trespassen in appetite and desire 
and in coueitise of possessions and of richesse, 
for comynlych men hauen neuere so moche richesse 
bot Ʒut þei wolde haue more. 
And, primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer assigneth double cause 
whi coueitise of richesse is endeles. 
Þe firste is itake 
by inordinat wille; 
þe seconde, 
by fals estimacioun of þe ende. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For as he seith, couetise of richesse is endeles 
and þe cause herof 
is for men ben besy to lyue 
and not to lyue wel. 
For al þat desiren richesse 
for to leue wel 
and for to helpe þe body desiren not endeles richesse; 
and al þat lyuen wel lyuen vertuousliche. 
And for men reccheþ 
not to lyue vertuousliche 
but al here besynesse 
is how þei mow lyue 
in lust and likynge of body – 
for it semeth þat richesse helpeþ most þerto, 
for to come by richesse to þyng 
þat he coueyteþ and desireþ 
eche man desireþ richesse – 
and for to haue þe bettre here purpos, 
men desiren richesse 
and hauen neuer inow þerof. 
Þe seconde wey for to preue þe same is itake 
by fals estimacioun of þe ende. 
For as þe philosofer distingweth, primo Poleticorum, 
and as we seide 
at þe fulle in þe firste book, 
þe ende and thinges 
þat ben iordeyned 
for þe ende ben diuersliche desired. 
For þe ende is endeles desireth, 
and þynges þat ben iordeyned 
for þe ende ben desired 
in manere and mesure of þat ende; 
as Ʒif þe endes of phisician 
is to hele þe sike man, 
þe fisician may neuere maken hym so hole þat he nolde make hym more hole Ʒif þat he myƷte. 
For þe phisician coueiteþ 
as it were to | make endeles helþe, 
but he Ʒeueþ drynches by þe manere 
and mesure of þe helthe. 
Þanne comynliche men hauen false trowynge of þe ende and trowen 
þat it scholde be sette in richesse 
and desyreth endeles richesse. 25 f. 108r 30 
But to rewelyng of hous it longeþ 
not to coueyte endeles richesse 
and þat we may preue by twey weyes. 
Þe firste is itake by liknesse 
þat craft of housbondrye 
and of rewelyng of hous hauen to kynde, 
þe seconde by likenesse 
þat craft of rewelyng of hous haþ 
to oþere craftes. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For we seen þat kynde is not besy 
to ordeyne endeles moche norsching 
but kynde ordeyneþ 
onliche so moche norsching 
as nedeþ to þe beste 
þat schal be norsched; 
as Ʒif kynde gendreþ 
a brid of þe white of þe ney, 
and fedeþ hym with þe Ʒolke, 
kynde ordeyneþ not in þe eye endeles moche Ʒolke 
but onlich so moche 
as suffiseth to fede þe bryd. 
Also of menstruale blood 
kynde makeþ a beest; 
and while þe beest is ifed wiþ melke, 
kynde ordeyneþ 
not in bestes endeles moche melk 
but onlich so moche 
as suffiseth to fede þe beest 
þat is igendred. 
Þanne for richesse 
is iordeyned 
for fedyng and norsching 
and for suffisant lif, 
as þe öolke in an ey is iordeyned 
for to fede þe bryd, 
and mylk in oddemes, 
pappes and tettes for to fede þe Ʒonge beste, 
Ʒit he þat is rewelere of hous 
wol not do aƷenst kynde 
but he wol rewle his hous 
by manere and ordre of kynde. 
He scholde not gete nother coueyte endeles greet richesse and posses- sioun; 
but whanne he haþ so moche as hym nedeþ 
for his staat to rewelyng of hous, 
he scholde hoolde hym apaied þerwith. 
Þe seconde wey is itake by 
lik|nesse þat is bytwene þe craft of rewelyng of hous and oþer craftes. 
For possessions bien þe instrumentes 
of þe craft of rewlyng of hous, 
as annefeld and hamers 
and oþere suche ben instrumentes of smythes craft. 
And as þe philosofer seith, primo Poleticorum, 
no craft hath endeles manye instrumentes. 
Þanne noþer craft of rewelyng of hous 
scholde desire endeles maynye possessions. 
Þanne alle citeseyns and namelich kynges and princes scholde be apaied wiþ 
so greet richesse and possessioun as nedeþ 
for here astaat, 
for coueitise of endeles greet richesse 
as it is ipreued comeþ 
of false trowynge of þe ende oþer of inordinat wille. 
Þanne þat is worse in kynges 
and in princes þan in oþere men 
by so moche as kynges and princes scholde haue ordinat wille 
and good trowynge of þe ende passynge oþere men. 
For as it was iseid in þe firste book, 
it is worse in a kyng to haue fals trowyng of þe ende þan in þe puple, 
for þe puple is ireweled by þe kyng, 
as it is worse Ʒif þe archers knowen not þe marke þan it is þei þe arwe knowe not þe mark, 
for þe archere rewleþ þe arwe. Chapter IX 
Ʒif þe philosofers wordes, primo Poleticorum, 
ben iknowe, 
alle chaungynges of byggynge and sellynge 
ben reducte and ibroƷt 
to þre manere changynges. 
Oon þerof is of changynge of thinges for thinges, 
as chaungynge of whete for wyne oþer for barliche oþer for oþer thinges 
þat helpen at bodilich nede. 
Þe oþer is chaungyng of þynges for money and aƷenward. Þe þridde is chaungynge of moneye for moneye, 
as whanne moneye of siluer 
is chaunged for moneye | of gold [oþer aƷenward, oþer] for money of oon land 
is changed for money of anoþer lond. 
Þanne for to wete how it nedeþ 
to brynge in suche chaungynges 
it is to wetyng 
þat Ʒif þer were no comynte bot comynte of hous 
þat is þe firste cominte, 
no chaungynge of byggyng 
and sillynge were nedful. 
For in hous þe housebonde is lord 
and to hym it longeþ to ordeyne for al þat ben in þe hous, 
wherfore al changyng þat is imad to meyntene 
þe hous is imaad by þe housebonde 
(in his owne persone oþer by mene procuratours), 
for to þe housebonde it longeþ to releue 
al þe nede of þe hous. 
But no thing is ichaunged 
for itself 
noþer ibouƷt noþer isolde, 
also no man changeþ 
with hymself noþer silleþ 
to hymselue noþer byeth of hymself. 
Þanne it is wel iseid, primo Poleticorum, 
þat in þe firste comynte 
þat is an hous 
nedeþ no suche changynge. 
Þanne for oþere comyntees 
such chaungyng was ibrouƷt inne. 
And þer ben oþere comyntees þan hous, 
as comynte of strete and of cite and of al þe regne and prouince 
oþer of diuers regnes 
and of diuerse prouinces. 
For sum tyme þynges 
þat nedeþ to þe lif 
ben not ifounde in al þe regne, 
þerfore it nedeþ 
þat sum men passe 
in to diuerse contrees of þe worlde 
as in to diuers regnes 
and regions and prouinces 
for to gete spicerie 
and oþere thinges 
þat nedeþ to þe lif. 
For bi cause of diuerse aspecte of sterres and of planettes, 
in som hoot contrees is plente of thinges 
of þe whiche is no plente 
in colde contrees and aƷenward; 
and þerfore by cause 
þat men mote comyne wiþ oþere not oonliche of oo strete oþer of | oon citee oþer of on prouince 
but also wiþ men of diuerse prouinces 
and of diuerse regnes, 
and þerfore þes forseide 
þre maneres of chaungynges 
ben ibrou[g]th in. 
For þey to þe comynte of a strete 
oþer of a citee chaungyng of thinges for thinges 
my^te suffise in som wise, 
Ʒut to þe comunycacioun 
þat is in al þe regne it 
nedeþ to haue changynge of þynges 
for money and aƷenward. 
Also þei in comunicacioun of al þe rewme changynge of þynges for money [myƷte suffise] and aƷenward, 
‡ Ʒit in comunicacioun 
þat is in diuerse regnes and prouinces it nedeþ to haue not onliche changynge of þynges for money 
but also of money for money. 
For as þe philosofer meneþ, primo Poleticorum, 
in oolde tyme men lyuede symplyche 
and changed 
as it were oonliche thinges for thinges, 
as Ʒif oon hadde moche wyne 
and anoþer moche whete, 
he changed wyne for whete 
and meynteyned suffisant lif 
by suche chaungyng. 
And þis manere 
as he seith was Ʒut ivsed among manye strange naciouns 
þat vsede no money 
but chaungede onlich thinges for thinges. 
And oon caas þis myƷte be vsed in oo strete oþer in oon toun 
and in oon citee; 
but in alle a regne oþer 
in al a prouince 
þat is long and brood þis vsage myƷte not wel be holde. 
For wyn and whete and oþere suche thinges 
þat vs nedeþ 
to þe lif ben ful heuye 
and mowe not þerfore be bore 
in to feer contrees, 
þanne it nedeþ to haue 
som what þat may wel be bore 
and is faire and profitable for þe 
whiche we may haue mete and drynke. 
And namelich gold oþer siluer is suche, 
for among metals gold and syluer ben fairest and most profitable and worschepful for þerof may vessel be maad 
that ben profitable for men. 
And he þat vseth suche vessel 
is acounted in worschip | and honour. 
Þanne first suche chaungyng 
of byenge and sellynge 
was chaungyng of thinges for metal 
onliche by þe wiƷt, 
as he þat wol haue so moche wyne scholde Ʒeue so moche 
w¿Ʒt of siluer 
oþer of gold 
oþer of oþer metal 
as þe puple and kynges wolde ordeyne in þat tyme. 
But for it was hard in eche byggyng and sellyng to haue alwey euene wiƷtes of metal, 
to descharge byers and sellers 
of suche weyenge and wiƷtes, 
in þe same metal was iwrete som prynte and tokene 
as an image of a prince oþer som oþer printe and tokene 
þat was iknowe 
by þe whiche it myƷte be knowe 
of what wiƷt 
and of what valewe 
þat metal scholde bee. 
Þanne in þis wise moneye was ibrouƷt in þat is as it were oure borowe 
for þe whiche we may fonge anon 
by þe valew what nedeþ 
to oure liflode. 
Þanne in al oon regne, 
for men þerof scholde not be to swithe igreued, 
for whanne þei scholde go out of þe 
o syde of þe regne to anoþer 
most bere wiþ hem charges of mete and drynke, 
for to putte of þat greef money 
was ifounde þat may esiliche be ibore, 
and in chaungyng þerof weyfaryng 
men may haue mete and drynke 
and oþere thing 
þat hem nedeþ. 
Wherfore on cas chaungyng of þynges for money and aƷenward myƷte suffice in o regne oþer in oon prouince, 
but for in diuerse regnes 
ben diuerse lordes 
and vsen not alle o maner money, 
men þat wonyen in dyuerse londes al withoute changyng of thinges for thinges 
oþer of þingis for 
m[one]y nedeþ to haue chaung- yng of money for money. 
Þanne it is declared 
how manye manere chaungynges 
þer ben of | byggyng and sellyng 
and how þei ben ifounde 
and what nede it was to brynge in money. 
Þanne a wise housebonde 
and a redy rewelere of hous 
scholde knowe how suche chaungynges come 
vp and where of he serueþ 
þat he may by suche knowyng 
kunne ordeyne þe betere for his hous. Chapter X 
After þe tretes of possessions it is skylful to trete of money, 
for wyne and corn is kyndelich richesse, 
and moneye is craftiliche richesse, 
[as þe philosopher seith, primo Poleticorum]. 
Þanne for craft is dependant of kynde 
and where þe worching of kynde endeþ 
þere worchynge of craft bygynneþ, 
after þe tretes of possessions 
of þe whiche comeþ kyndeliche richesse 
it is skylful to trete of money 
þat is craftiliche richesse. 
Þanne Ʒif after possessions 
it is to tretyng of money, 
after þat we seide what nede it was to fynde money, 
it is to spekynge how many maners 
þer ben of money. 
And [in] Poletic[is] þe philosofer distingueth foure maners of money 
þat ben icleped by hym naturalis, campsoria, obolostatica, takos 
(þat is vsurie). 
In þis foure manere wise men 
were iwont to haue moche money. 
Þanne þe firste manere of þis money 
is icleped 
as it were naturalis, 
kyndelich money, 
and is igete by chaungynge of kyndelich thinges for money. 
Þan Ʒif a man haue moche wyne and corn 
þat groweþ kyndeliche and fongeþ money, 
þerfore þat money is icleped 
as it were kyndelich moneye 
for it 
is ifonge for kyndeliche þynges. 
Þe seconde manere of moneye 
is iclepede camsoria, 
as it were money of chaungyng. 
And, primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seith þat on caas þis money was i|founde by happe 
and †not sympliche† 
and is afterward by experience 
imaad craftiliche moneye, 
for to speke of moneye 
in itsilf eche maner money 
is most worthi 
in his owne londe. 
But it happeþ som tyme 
þat in som lond 
sum man hath money 
þat is litel worthi in þat londe 
for it is not money of þat londe. 
Þanne it happede þat he wente 
with þat money 
and passe in to þe lond 
of þe whiche þat was þe money and fenge þe more for þat money 
þanne it is worthi 
in his owne lond 
and for suche doynge men 
vsen changyng of money 
and of þis happe comeþ craft of chaungyng of money 
so þat afterward men taken heede what money is worthi 
in diuerse londes 
and in what londe what money is best. 
And so by craft comeþ forth chaungynge of money 
by cause of wynnynge. 
And þis money schal not be cleped kyndelich money for it 
bygynneþ not at kyndelich thinges 
noþer endeþ at kyndeliche thinges. 
But in þis craft 
as þe philosofer seith, primo Poleticorum, 
money is þe bygynnynge and ende for þe craft 
bygynneþ at money 
þat he Ʒeueth and endeþ at money 
þat he fongeþ 
and so þere money is icleped bygynnyng and ende. 
Þe þridde manere of money [is] obolostatica 
and þat is to menynge passynge wiƷt oþir peise 
and was ifounde in þis wise: 
for as moneye is imaad 
of a gadde of metal and haþ a comynte prynte and signe, 
and sum tyme for certeyne nede 
as for to make vessel oþer for som oþer thinges, 
of money is imaad 
a gad of metal 
and som tyme of so manye penyis is a gad imaad of more wight þan so many peny|es scholde weye. 
And þerof comeþ þe craft 
þat alle pans scholde be iweye 
and þe heuyest pans 
and most of peyse scholde be molte 
and a gad of metal imaad þerof for to haue wynnyng þerby. 
Þanne þe craft obolastatica, 
passyng wiƷt and peise, 
comeþ of passyng wiƷt and peyse of money 
as it were wynnynge by peyse money. 
Þe ferþe manere of money hatte takos 
and þat word 
is to menyng burþe and gendryng. 
For it semeth þat þis craft wolde gendre and conceyue and brynge forþ money and we clepen comynliche þis craft vsura for neuere thinges 
encresen in hemself 
but by generacioun, 
concepcioun and burþe. 
As Ʒif a man haþ ten scheep 
at þe bygynnynge 
and twenty at þe Ʒeres ende 
þat is for þe scheep gendreth and enyeth. 
Þanne Ʒif a man wol of ten pans haue 
after a certeyn tyme twenty 
þat money is icleped vsuraria 
as it were money igete by vserye 
as it is clerliche iknowe suche a man wolde 
þat þis money scholde gendre 
(eny oþer caluy) 
and brede more moneye. 
Þanne vsura is riƷtful icleped burþe 
and bredyng of money. [In] Poletic[is] þe philosofer seith þat of þis foure maneres of money 
oonliche þe firste is kyndeliche 
and is igete 
as it were by housbondrye. 
And by hym þe oþer þre ben to blamynge, 
for al craft þat bygynneþ 
at money 
and endeþ at money setteþ 
þe ende in money 
as it semeth. 
Þanne campsoria, 
þat is iwonne by chaunchyng of money, 
and obolastatica, 
þat is iwonne by passynge of wiƷt 
and of peise of moneye, 
and vsura, 
for | he stondeþ 
as it were al in money, 
for þei bygynnen at money 
and endeþ at money 
þei ben þerfore to blame, 
for þe philosofer seith þat a man 
is to coueitous of money 
Ʒif al his workes 
bygynnen at money and endeþ at money. 
But how it euere be of camsoria, 
wynnynge by chaungyn of money, 
and obolastatica, 
wynnynge by passyng wiƷt and peyse of money, 
vsura is euel 
and to blamynge 
in alle 15 poyntes, 
as it schal be declared in þe nexte chapitre. 
No man scholde vse vsura; 
and þeiƷ marchauntes 
and oþere be isuffred 
to vse camp- soria and obolastatica, 
Ʒut kynges and princes 
þat scholde be 
as it were half goddes schulde not vse but þe first maner of money, 
þat hatte yconomyca 
and is as it were kyndelich moneye 
(and is ifonge for kyndelich thinges 
þat comeþ forþ by housbondrye, 
for housbondrie hatte yconomya in Latyn). 
And kynges and prynces scholde haue grete possessions and rentes, 
and mowe for þe fruyt 
þerof haue money ynowƷ 
for defence of þe regne 
and for oþere nedes. 5 f. 110r 10 15 20 Chapter XI 
As þe ferþe of moneye 
þat þe philosofer 
clepeþ takos haþ twey manere names, 
so by twey resons we may preue þat it is euel. For first, it is icleped gendryng and burþe of pans 
by þe whiche name þe philos- ofer, primo Poleticorum, 
argeweth þat it is aƷenst kynde. 
For gendryng and burþe and multeplyeng in hemself 
is aproprede to kyndelich thing- 
es and is aƷenst kynde of crafty thinges. 
For formes, stooles and cofres ben crafty thinges, 
[þei] multeplien not hemself 
be hou euere so moche togedres; 
but for beestes ben kyndelich thinges, 
þei | gendren and breden and multeplien hemself 
whanne þei ben ifere. 
Þan he þat wol þat pens 
schulde multeplien hemself – 
as he þat wolde þat ten pans scholde be twenty 
by passyng of tyme – wolde 
þat crafty thinges 
scholde gendre and brede and multeplie hemself. 
And for þat is aƷenst kynde of crafty thinges 
and a peny is a crafty thing, 
it is wel iseid, primo Poleticorum, 
þat vsura, vsuri, 
is euel and aƷenst kynde. 
Þe seconde, 
by þe oþere name þerof we may preue 
þat suche moneye is euel. 
For þe oþer name þerof is vsura and vsura 
is raueyne of vse and aƷenst good vse. 
For in vsura þe vse is raveysched and wrongfullich itake, 
for in vsurie þe same thing is isold tweyes for þe vse is isold tweyes. 
For euydence herof 
it is to wetynge 
þat þeiƷ a thing 
and þe vse of a thing ben diuerse, 
as an hous and wonyng þerinne ben dyuerse, 
gut in som thinges graunt of þe vse 
may neuere be departed 
fro graunt of þe thing. 
Þanne in alle thinges 
in þe whiche þe vse of þe thing 
may be grauntjed 
withoute grauntynge of þe substaunce, 
þerof suche thinges may pensioun and rente ‡ be take þei þe thing be not apeyred. 
But Ʒif þe vse may not be graunted 
withoute grauntynge of þe substaunce, 
for suche an vse scholde no pensioun 
noþer rente be fonge – 
and Ʒif it is itake, 
it is vsura þat is raueyne of vse – þanne for vse of hous 
is wonynge þerinne 
and is not alienacioun þerof, 
he þat hath hous 
may graunte þe vse þerof; 
for he may graunte tenantes 
to wonye þerinne þouƷ þei graunte hem not | 
þe substaunce of þe hous. 
For þe hous and þe vse þerof 
is his owne 
and he may lawefulliche selle 
what is his owne 
and do no man wrong. 
Þanne he rauescheth not noþer doþ wrong þeiƷ he holde to hymself 
þe lordschipe of þe hous 
þei he graunte oþere men þe vse and leue to wonye þerinne. 10 f. 110v 15 
But it fareth not so in moneye, 
for þe propre vse of moneye 
is spendyng þerof and alienacioun. 
Þanne þe propre vse of money 
may neuere be graunted 
withoute graunt of þe substaunce þerof, 
for in suche an vse þe substaunce þerof mot be aliened. 
Þanne for accident is dependant of substance 
and þe vse comeþ of þe thing, 
it is wel iseid 
þat he þat oweth þe substaunce oweþ þe vse. 
Þanne he þat wol take pensioun 
and rente of þe vse of money 
doþ vserye and wrong and ravescheth þe vse; 
for in grauntynge þe vse of a peny, 
he graunteþ þe peny. 
Þanne whanne he graunteþ þe peny, 
þe vse þerof 
is no lengere his owne. 
Wherfore Ʒif he takeþ pencioun 
oþer rente for þat vse, 
he selleþ what is not his owne 
and takeþ pencioun and rente of thing 
þat is not his owne, 
for þe vse of þe peny 
is no lenger his owne 
whanne he hath igraunted þe peny to anoþer man. 
But it is to wetynge as þe philosofer seith, primo Poletik, 
þat as it were eche thing 
hath twey manere vse: 
þe on is propre 
and þe oþere is not propre. 
Þe propre vse of a peny is chaungyng and spendyng þerof 
and alienacioun þerof. 
Þe oþer vse 
is for to make face 
and schewyng 
and for to be holde riche. 
Also þe proper vse of hous 
is wonyng þerinne, 
and þe oþer vse þerof 
is sillyng and chaungynge þerof. 
For many men maken hous | 
not onlich for to wonye þerinne 
but for to selle. 
And of eche vse 
wher it be proper oþer not proper may pencioun and rente be take Ʒif 
þat vse may be graunted 
withoute grauntynge of þe substance. 
Wherfore it is playnliche declared 
þat it is contrarie of money 
and of oþer þynges; 
for [o]f þe proper vse of money 
may no rente be fonge withoute vserie, 
for þe vse may not be graunted 
withoute grant of þe substance. 
But of þe vse 
þat is not propre may rente be fonge, 
as Ʒif a man wolde schewe moche moneye 
not for to spende 
but for to be holde riche 
as marchauntes doþ ofte tyme for to be holde riche and for oþere men scholde do moneye in here warde with þe bettere wille, 
þei hauen tofore hem moche money. 
Þanne a man may graunte money 
to suche vse 
wiþoute grauntynge of þe substaunce þerof; 
Ʒif a man takeþ rente of money in þat wise, 
on caas it is som manere synne 
but nathales 
it is not vsery. 
And ofte in oþere thinges 
is þe contrarie, 
as in þe propre vse it [is] not vserye. 
For wonynge in hous 
is þe propre vse of hous 
and may be graunted 
withoute grauntynge of þe substaunce þerof, 
þeiƷ me take rente of þat vse, 
it is not vsurie. 
But Ʒif a man selleþ an hous 
þat is not þe propre vse of hous and fongeþ 
not his money anoun, 
Ʒif þei fongen more money for þe vse [o]f þe hous, 
it is vserie for þe vse 
is not his after 15 
þat he haþ isolde þe hous. 
For þanne it is vserie for þe vse is igraunted and isold þe whiche vse 
i[s] not þe creaunsoures his owne, 
and þat is aƷenst kynde. 
Þanne kynges and princes, 
Ʒif þey wollen be kyndelich lordes, 
scholde forbede vsurie for it is aƷenst lawe of kynde. Chapter XII Circa finem, primo Politicorum, 
þe philosofer distingweth diuerse maners of getyng of money, 
and þat is ido 
as it were in fyue manere wise. 
Þe firste þerof hatte possessioun; 
þe seconde, mercatiua; 
þe þridde, mercenaria and conductiua; 
þe ferþe, experimentalis; 
þe fifte, artificialis. 
Þe firste manere of getyng of money hatte possessoria 
and is whanne a man haþ gret poscescioun 
and geteþ moneye 
for þe fruyt þerof. 
For þe philosofer seith þat an housebonde 
and a rewelere of hous scholde be expert 
and knowe possessioun and whiche ben most fruitful 
and by þe whiche housholde scholde be holpe at nede. 
And þat is Ʒif he knoweth 
what maner richesse 
is most plente 
in what londes and contrees, 
as a man hath most plente of bestes 
in þe contre in þe whiche suche bestes 
ben best ikept and isaued. 
And in what wise þat myƷte be knowe 
and how a man scholde haue hym aboute possessions 
and how bryddes and foules 
and foure fotede bestes scholde be kepte and isaued 
and what lond bereþ best com 
and what lond is best for vynes 
and how tren scholde be kepte we desposen 
to passe wiþ silence. 
For oþere hauen 
as it semeth itreted of suche doynges 
atte fulle, 
and Paladius spekeþ moche of suche doynges. 
Þe seconde manere of getyng of money hatte mercatiua, 
and is by marchaundise by see, 
oþer by londe, 
oþer sendeþ 
in þis manere wynnynge. 
Þat hatte mercatiua 
is ideled in þre partees 
as þe philosofer meneþ. 
Oon hatte nauicularia 
and is by see, 
and þe oþer is carriage by | londe, 
and þe þridde hatte astrix. 
Þe þridde maner wynnyng of money hatte mercenaria and conduc- tiua, 
as whanne a man worcheþ for mede oþer for huyre. 
Þe ferþe hatte experimentalis, 
and experience is of singuler thinges. 
Þanne whanne a man knoweth singuler doynges 
of certeyne men 
by þe whiche þei wynnen money, 
þanne he haþ þe maner of wynnynge 
þat hatte experimentalis 
for he knoweth it by experience. 
And þe philosofer reherseth twey singuler doynges 
by þe whiche money is iwonne. 
Þe firste was þe doyng of oon Gallo Mellonys, 
on of þe seuene wise men 
þat bygonne first to traueille in philosofie. 
And he was poore and blamede 
and despised of manye men 
for he traueilede in philosophie, 
and me axede of hym 
whereto his philosofie 
was worth for alway 
he was poore and nedy. 
Not for coueitise of moneye 
but to preue 
þat philosofres mowe sone by riche Ʒif þei wolle occupie hem 
aboute suche doynge, 
he seig and knew by astronomye 
þat in þe nexte Ʒer 
þerafter scholde be moche oyle of olyue; 
he bouƷte al þe oyle of al men of þat lond 
þat þei scholde gadere in þat Ʒeere and borwede money 
and Ʒaf ernesse 
for al þe oyle of þat Ʒere. 
Þanne for he hadde moche oile 
and also for no man hadde oyle but he, 
he wan moche money and preuede in þat wise 
þat þe philosofer 
may so be riche. 
Þe seconde particuler doyng þe philosofer 
reherseth of oon Siculus, 
a man of Cicilia 
þat bouƷte al þe yre of a feyre and solde aƷen 
at his owne wille 
and wan moche money 
for no man solde ire but he. 
And among oþere | maneres of wynnyng of money 
as þe philosofer meneþ, 
monopoliais a gretmanere of wynnyng. 
Ʒut monopolia is whan on selleþ and non mo, 
for whanne onlich on selleþ 
he setteþ þe pris at his owne wil. 
Þan he þat wol wynne money 
mot haue such synguler doynge in mynde 
by þe which money is iwonne 
þat he may Ʒif he seeth his tyme wynne money 
by suche singuler doyng 
Ʒif suche doynge were laweful. 25 f.111v 30 
Þe fifte manere hatte artificialis, craft, 
whanne a man 
wynneþ money 
by þe craft 
þat he vseth. 
For þeiƷ þe ende of þe craft of cheualrie 
be þe victorie 
and of phisik by helthe, 
Ʒut alle craftes ben iordeyned 
as it were to moneye. 
For of crafty work phisicians, smethes, carpunters, 
and also knyƷtes þat ben souderes, desiren money. 
Þan eche man 
þat wol lyue in laweful comynte scholde ordeyne for thinges 
þat nedeþ to hous and haue charge of getyng of money 
as his staat axeth. 
And among kynges and princes 
onlich twey maners semen good among maners 
þat ben itouched. 
Þe twey maners ben possessoria and experimentalis. 
For þei scholde in hemself 
oþere by oþere be expert 
and knowe singuler condicions 
of þe regne and singuler doynges 
of here forfadres 
by þe whiche money was iwonne 
and scholde kepe good vsages 
of þe regne 
by þe whiche þei fongen laweful rente. 
And þei scholde not byneme 
oþere menne good wrong- fulliche. 
Þanne knowyng of singuler doynges 
and of vsages is alowed 
and þe manere of experience 
is good for kynges and princes to wynne money. 
Also þe manere wynnynge 
þat hatte possessoria 
is good not onliche in 
possessi|ons þat ben vnmeuable, 
as feldes and vyngerdes 
and oþere suche, 
but also þei schulde haue moche possessioun mouable 
and manye bestes and foules 
to helpe þe lif 
at þe fulle. 
For we seen þat Frederik, 
þe emperour þat was iholde so worldlych wise, 
hadde many diuers places of storre not wiþstondyng 
þat his owne lond was most fructuous and victaylles 
were good cheep þerinne, 
nathales as it were alwey he wolde haue flesch mete of his owne 
boþe of bestes and of foules. 
And þat is semelich for kynges and princes 
and for oþer men 
of þe regne 
þat it seme not þat þei lyue as strangers and pilgrimes, 
for he þat beggeþ alle vitayles for money lyueþ more liche 
a straungere þa[n] a citeseyn. 
Wherfore kynges and princes schulde haue scley men and cunnynge 
ouer telyng of feldes 
and of vynegerdes 
and also ouer bestes, 
roþeren and schipe, 
and oþer bestes þat helpen to þe lif 
– not oonlich foure fotede bestes 
but also bryddes and foules, 
as it is ofte ivsed 
in som contre to haue manye coluers 
and oþer foules 
of þe whiche mete 
is itake for houshold. 
And as þe philosofer seith [in] Poletic[is] me scholde be besy aboute telyng Ʒif þe lond of þe 
contre is good for suche telynge. 
And so in couenable contrees 
wiþ litel cost moche fruyt comeþ of bueen. 
Þanne schortliche to speke to hem 
þat wol lyue in laweful comynte, 
alwey cyuel lif is bettre 
þan pilgrymes lif 
and it is bettre a man to haue mete 
of his owne 
þan bygge al for money. Chapter XIII 
It is iseyd tofore 
in þis þridde partie 
þat it scholde be spoke of 
⌜foure⌝:⌜of⌝ housyng, of possessions, of money, | and of seruantes. 
Þanne for þe þre ben isped, 
it is to spekyng of þe ferþe, 
as of seruantes. 
And first we schal declare 
þat som seruage is kyndelich [and] þat it is kyndelich spedful 
to som men 
to be soget to oþere. 
And þat þe philos- ofer preueth, primo Poleticorum, 
by foure euydences itake by foure manere liknesses. 
Þe firste is itake by liknes 
þat is in souleles thinges. 
Þe seconde, 
by þe parties of þe same beste. 
Þe þridde, 
by diuerse kynde of beestes. 
Þe ferþe, 
by dyuersete of sexus in mankynde. Sexus is þe diuersete of maal and of femel. 30 f. 112r 35 
Þe firste euydence 
is declared in þis wise. 
For neuere oon is maad of m[a]neye in þew ordre 
but oon þerof haue more maystrie 
þan oþer – 
as Ʒif oon armonye and acorde is maad of manye voices, 
þerinne mot be som voice 
þat hath maistrie 
by þe whiche al þe armonye is idemed. 
Also Ʒif oo melled body 
is imaad of manye elementis, 
þer mot be som meister element 
by þe whiche 
þat melled body 
haþ kynde meuynge and place. 
And þerfore it is þat 
in alle melled bodyes 
erþe haþ þe maystrie, 
for alle suche bodies 
ben heuye 
and meuen kyndeliche downward. 
Wherfore Ʒif it is so in sowleles thinges 
þat neuere oon is imaad kyndeliche of menye 
but som oon be mayster þerinne, 
and companye of men is kyndelich for man 
is kyndeliche a companable beest 
as it is preued 
tofore atte fulle, 
neuere of manye men scholde be kyndelich o companye noþer a laweful comynte 
but it were kyndelich among men 
þat som scholde be kyndelich lordes 
and somme kyndeliche seruantes. 
Þanne somme men ben kyn|deliche [lordes] 
and som kyndeliche seruantes. 
Þe seconde euydence to preue 
þe same is itake by thinges 
that we seen in the same beeste. 
For eche beest hath essencial partes, body and soule, 
þer þe soule is as it were lord 
and þe body 
as it were seruant and obedient. 
For þe body may not rewele itself 
to þew workes and dedes 
but it is reweled 
to suche workes and dedis by vertue of þe soule. 
Þan for many men 
ben ilikned to oþir 
as þe body to þe soule, 
it folweþ þat þei ben kyndeliche seruantg for som men lacken wit 
and vnderstondyng 
and mow not rewle hemself 
in þew workes and dedes. 
Þan it is spedful 
to hem 
to be reweled by oþere men 
and to be soget to oþer men. 
Þan as in a vertuous man 
and wel desposed þe soule 
hath lordschipe and maystrie 
and þe body is obedient, 
so in policy and comynte 
was iordeyned wise men 
scholde be lordes 
and vnwise men obedyent. For vnwyse men 
ben ilikned to wise men 
as þe body to þe soule 
and as þe instrument 
to þe craftes man, 
nathales som tyme vnwyse men 
ben more lordes þanne wise men. 
But þat comeþ of euel policy and rewelyng; 
for as in an euel man 
þat hath an euel soule 
þe body and lust of felyng 
hath more maystrie 
þan þe soule oþer resoun, 
so in euel polecye and rewelyng vnwis men 
ben more maistres þan wise men. 
Þe þridde euydence 
is itake 
by diuerse kynde of bestes, 
as by man in comparisoun to oþere beestes. 
For as it is iseid tofore man 
is kyndelich lord of oþere beestes, 
for we seen þat many tame bestes 
as hors and houndes ben in many caas isaued by wit of man, 
þei mowe not saue hemself 
by here owne wit. 
Þanne it is kyndelich to hem 
to be sogett to man 
for by wit of man 
þei ben ireweled and isaued. 
Þanne for vnwise men 
ben ilikned to wise men 
as bestes to | men 
for hem lackeþ witte 
and kunneþ not rewle hemself, 
as it is kyndeliche 
þat bestes be seruauntes to men 
so it is kyndelich þat vnwise men be soget to wise men. 
And yi[t] it is spedful to hem 
to be soget in þat wise 
þat þei mowe 
by here wit be ireweled and isaued. 
Þe ferþe is itake by diuerse sexus oþer 
by diuersete of maal oþer of femel. 
For we seen þat for a man 
can more reson 
þan a womman, 
a man is maister ouer a womman. 
Primo Poleticorum, 
it is iseid 
þat a womman 
hath feble counsayle. 
Þanne whanne we seen 
þat som men hauen more defaute of vse of resoun 
þan oþere men passynge defaute 
þat wymmen hauen more þan men, 
þanne it folweth 
þat þei scholde be kyndeliche seruantes. 
Wherfore in som wise seruyce is kyndeliche, 
and it is kyndeliche spedful tocompanye ofmankynde 
þat summebe seruantesand somme be lordes 
as it was iseid 
in þe bygynnyng of þe chapitre. Chapter XIV 
As al wiþoute lawe of kynde 
for þe comyn profit it nedeþ to haue positif lawes 
by þe whiche regnes and citees schulde be rewled, 
so it semede hem 
þat made lawes 
þat al withoute kyndelich seruage 
by þe whiche vnwise men schulde serue wise men 
it nedeþ to haue laweful seruage 
and as it were positif 
by þe whiche feble men 
and ouercome scholde serue victores and myƷti men. 
Primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seith þat it is laweful 
riƷt þei þat ben ouercome in bataille serue hem þat ouercomen. 
And þe philosofer seith þat suche riƷt 
is positif and skilful 
and þat may be declared 
by þre euydences. 
Þe first is itake 
by hem þat maken lawes. 
| Þe seconde, 
by þe defence of þe contray. 
Þe þridde, 
by sauacioun of hem 
þat ben ouercome in bataille. 
Þe firste euydence 
and skile is declared in þis wise. For as þe philos- 
ofer seith [in] Polethictis], 
þe lord mot in som wise passe 
þe seruant 
and suche passyng 
may be double – in soule oþer in body, 
for eche man is kyndelich imaad of thes tweye parties. 
And passynge in godnesse of þe soule 
may be cleped 
as it were verrey 
and passyng and parfit. 
And passyng in goodnesse of þe body 
it is not so parfit passynge, 
for suche godenesse is not so good 
as goodnesse of þe soule 
but þei ben lasse good 
þan goodnesse of þe soule. 
Þerfore it is wel iseid, primo Poleticorum, 
þat Ʒif we seyen þat som men ben worthi to be lordes 
for þei passen in goodnesse of þe body 
as for þei ben faire and stronge, 
moche more þat scholde be diffyned in þe soule so 
þat we seiye þat som men ben worthi to be lordes 
for þei passen 
in goodnesse of þe soule, 
for þe soule is bettre þanne þe body. 
Þanne wit and wisdom 
and oþer goodnesse of þe soule makeþ kyndelich lordschipe and parfit and wise men 
and goode lordes of vnwis men and euel. 
But cyuyl myƷt and bodilich strengþe þat ben goodnesse of þe body and outward good 
makeþ not parfit and kyndelich lordschipe, 
but þei maken laweful lordschipe and positif. 
For he þat passeth in goodnesse of þe body, 
as in strengþe and in cyuyle myƷt and power scholde be here lord 
þat he ouercomeþ in bataille, 
is not kyndelich riƷt 
by promilgacioun and cryenge of lawe, 
nathales in som wise suche riƷt semeþ skyl|ful Ʒif we taken hede 
to makers of lawes. 
For makers of lawes knowen betere good 
of þe bodye and outward good 
þan good of þe soule and inward good. 
For lawe scholde Ʒeue doom of som certeyne doynge, it semede hem 
þat Ʒaf lawes 
þat victores in batailles scholde be here lordes 
þat ben ouercome in bataille for suche passyng 
is more iknowe þanne þe oþer. 
And so þe philosofer seith þat it is more riƷtful 
to deme lordschipe 
by goodnesse of þe soule 
þanne by goodnesse of þe body. 
But as he seith it is not ileche liƷt, 
ethe, 
to knowe þe goodnesse of þe soule 
and of þe body. 
Þe seconde euydence and skyle is itake 
by defence of þe contre. 
For by cause þat men scholde fiƷte strongliche 
for defence of citees and of regnes for fauour of þe comynte and of þe contre, 
it was ibrouƷt in and iordeyned 
þat victores in bataille 
scholde be here lordes 
þat ben ouercome. 
Wherfore vertuous wise and good men 
scholde not wiþstonde laweful ordenaunce 
for þe comyn profit 
is betere þan singuler profit. 
Þe þridde euydence 
and skyle is ytake 
by sauacioun of hem 
þat ben ouercome in bataille, 
for ofte by þis lawe men ben isaued 
þat ben ouercome in bataille. 
For victores wolde be þe more inclyned to manslauƷt Ʒif þei know 
þat þei scholde haue no profit of hem; 
but whanne þei knowen þat þei mowe haue hem seruantes, 
þei sauen hem for profit 
þat þei hopen haue of hem. 
Þerfore a seruant is icleped seruus in Latyn and þis nowne seruus comeþ of seruando (sauynge, 
in o manere menyng): 
for victores in bataille 
saueþ suche men and sleeth hem not for þei wol haue hem | to seruantes, 
boþe seruynge men and wymmen. Chapter XV 
We may saye þat þer ben foure manere of seruantes, 
for som ben kyndeliche seruantes 
and somme by lawe and somme for huyre and mede and somme for vertue and loue. 
Þanne eche seruant is barbarus oþer vnmyƷty oþer ihuyred oþer vertuoes. 
He is icleped barbarus 
þat is as it were wilde 
and can not rewle hymsilf 
and is þerfore kyndelich a seruant, 
as it is declared tofore. 
For suche faillen 
in godenesse of þe soule 
and oþere passen 
in goodnesse of þe soule 
and ben lordes of suche. 
VnmyƷty seruantes ben seruantes by lawe, 
as Ʒif hem lacken myƷt and strengþe 
and mowe not withstonde werryours 
and ben þerfore here seruantes by promilgacioun of lawe. 
Huyred men ben seruantes for huyre; 
and such oon is icleped mercennarius 
for he serueth principaliche 
for mede and huyre. 
But goode seruauntes and vertuous seruen for vertu and for loue. 
And þeiƷ a work man 
be worthi his huyre 
and þeiƷ no man scholde tra- uaille 
on his owne cost noþer 
it is skylful 
þat he do, 
nathales a seruant scholde serue principalliche for good entent. 
And Ʒif he desireth worlde- liche huyre, 
þat scholde be þe consequent folwyng. 
And it nedeþ to haue seruyce 
for huyre and for loue 
al withoute kyndeliche seruice 
and laweful seruice. 
For oure appetite is corrupte 
and we holde not alwey kynde ordre, 
comynliche lordschipe is euel; 
for vnwyse men 
þat lacken goodnesse 
of þe soule 
wolle not serue wise men and redy. 
Also for it happeth som tyme 
þat many men 
þat ben icome of greet blood 
doþ not riƷtful bataille 
al | here lif tyme by þe whiche þei myƷte gete seruantes men and wymmen 
to helpe in housholde at nede, 
þanne for suche scholde not be alle seruantes, 
it nedeþ to haue summe seruantes for huyre 
and som for loue and vertuous seruantes for loue of good entent. 5 f. 
And to þes seruantes 
þat seruen for vertue and for loue kynges and princes scholde haue hemself 
as to here owne children and rewle hem not as seruantes 
but as here owne children. 
And we may by twey euydenses 
preue þat Ʒif þer ben eny suche seruantes, 
þei scholde be worschepped more þan oþer. 
Þe firste euydence 
is itake by worthi- nesse of seruantes. 
Þe seconde, 
for þey ben nyƷ to þe lord. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For alwey þe more worthi scholde þei haue þe more worthi benefet, 
þanne Ʒif a vertuous seruant seruen 
for loue of honeste 
and for loue of his lord, 
he is more worthi þan he þat serueth principaliche for huyre, 
and is also more worthi þan oon 
þat serueþ 
not for loue of honeste 
but for he is ouercome in bataille, 
and is also betere þan þe seruant 
þat hatte barbarus 
and is vnkunnynge 
and can not rewle hymself 
but lackeþ vse of resoun. 
Þanne by worthinesse of seruantes 
it is declared þat þe lord 
scholde rewarde suche seruantes more þan oþere. 
Þe seconde euydence to preue þe same is itake by vnyte 
and for suche seruantes 
ben nyƷ to þe lord. 
For it is skyle þat parties 
þat ben next to þe welle hauen more water 
þan oþer, 
for eche loue hath a maner vertue of onynge 
as Denys menyth, 
De Diuinis Nominibus, iiii, seruantes of kynges and of princes 
þat seruen not principaliche for mede 
but for loue ben more nere 
and more ioned to | þe lordes 
þan oþere seruantes. 
Wherfore it is worthi 
þat þei haue more worschepe 
and bettre reward þan oþere. Chapter XVI 
For in hous of kynges 
and of princes seruantes ben iset in offis so þat som arayen for mete bordes 
and som ben maystres of hors and som ben in oþere office 
as honest manere axeþ, 
as it longeþ 
to þis doynge 
þre mot be iknowe: ordre of seruynge, liƷtnesse of folwynge, 
and condicioun of seruantes. First, 
it is to wetyng 
þat seruantes scholde be sette in office of hous 
so þat good ordre of seruyng be holde. 
And þat is ido 
at þe beste Ʒif neuere manye seruantes 
ben isette in on office 
but þei ben vnder on þat is chef of þat office 
and more principalich 
toke hede þerto and haþ cheef of þat office. 
And þe cause here is assigned, 
ii Poleticorum, 
þat it is iseide 
þat many seruantes seruen worse þan fewe. 
For whanne many ben iset to oon office, 
ofte þat office is forgendred 
for ofte eche of þe seruantes 
is neggligent 
in þe seruice 
and troweth 
þat anoþer doþ it; 
for ouer al where multitude 
is þere is confusioun 
but þat multitude be vnder 
on þat is cheef þerof. 
For as we seen in þe worlde 
þat is best iordeined 
for þe multitude of thinges 
þat ben þerinne ben vnder oon 
as vnder oon God 
þat ordeyneth alle thinges, 
so eche multitude 
[i]f it schal be ordinat mot be vnder oon to þe whiche it is iordeyned 
oþer of þe whiche it is iordeyned. 
Wherfore Ʒif manye seruantes ben isette in oon office 
for þat office scholde not be furgendrid 
noþer myskepte noþer be inordenate, 
oon mote be isette 
in þat office cheef aboue alle þe oþere 
þat mot rewle and ordeyne alle þe oþere. 
And þis lore | 
is most nedful in rewelyng of hous of kynges: 
for þerinne ben grete office, 
it nedeþ 
[þ]at manye seruantes ben in oon office 
for oon may not do al þat longeþ to þat office. 
Þanne in settynge of seruantes in office ordre of seruynge mot be knowe. 
5 10 15 f. 114r 20 Þe seconde, 
liƷtnesse of folwynge 
and of doynge mot be knowe, 
and þat is best iknowe Ʒif 
oon is sette in manye diuerse office. 
And þe resoun herof 
may be take of þynges 
þat ben iseid, 
iiii Polethicorum. 
For we schal imagine in þis wise 
þat as a grete citee 
hath itself 
to a litil citee, 
so a greet hous hath itself 
to a litel hous. 
And as it is iseid, 
circa finem, iiii Poleticorum, 
in a greet citee oon man scholde not haue manye diuerse office, 
for in a greet citee office 
ben grete and hauen wiþ 
so greet charge 
þat oon persone may not liƷtliche do manye office and diuerse. 
But in a litel citee oþer 
in a litel toun 
for þer wonyen 
but fewe men 
and þer þe office 
hauen no greet chaarge, 
oon may haue diuerse offices. 
Þanne what is iseid 
of a litel citee 
and a greet schal be vnderstonde 
of a litel hous and a greet. 
But in a litel hous 
þere ben fewe seruantes and office with litel charge it is not euel sittynge 
þey oon seruant haue many offices, 
for þe houshold myƷte be so litel 
þat on seruant myƷte esiliche be kook and seruant 
at þe borde and porter of þe Ʒeate. 
But in hous of kynges and princes 
þer ben manye seruantes 
and þere offices hauen greet charge, 
þe office moot nedes be departed 
and distingwed 
and not oon isette 
in manye offices 
lest esy spendynge of þe office be ilette. 
Þe þridde, 
in settynge of seruantes | 
in office þe condicioun of hem mot be knowe, 
for comynliche seruantes faillen in tweyne. 
For som doun euel þe work 
þat þey ben isette to, 
for as somme despisen and doun fraude 
in þe kynges lawe. 
And somme doþ euel þe work 
þat þei ben isette to, 
but þat is not of euel wil for þei wolde good 
but þat is by dulnesse of wit 
for þei ben dul and vnwise. 
Þerfore þouƷ þei decerne not and doun no fraude, 
gut þei ben deceyued and bygeled by fraude. 
Þanne where ben manye seruantes 
þei mot be trewe and wise: 
trewe in riƷtful wille 
þat þei doun no fraude, 
and wise and sley of vnderstondyng 
þat is iknowe by lengþe of tyme. 
For we may not ise þe herte of a man; 
but Ʒif he bere hym wel and treweliche long tyme 
and in diuerse tymes 
and in diuerse offices 
þat he hath ben inne, 
þanne he is trewe. Wisdom and prudencia 
is iknowe by thinges 
þat we seide in þe firste book 
– as Ʒif he haþ good mynde 
and is wel avised 
and waar al aboute and oþer 
þat we seide þere, 
he is iholde wise and prudens, 
and þat as he hath more 
oþer lasse of suche condiciouns. Chapter XVII For þe wisdom of a kyng 
is most iknowe Ʒif he reweleth wel his maynye and fynden hem ordinatliche what hem nedeþ, 
and for good prouisioun of cloþyng semeþ 
most helpliche to þe staat of worschepe, 
for kynges and princes scholde be tauƷt 
how þei scholde do worschep- 
fulliche 
and wisliche in þat doyng, 
it is to wetynge how clothinge scholde be iƷeue. 
And to euydence þerof 
as it longeþ 
to þis doynge it is to | wetynge þat fife most be knowe: 
greet doynge of þe kyng, 
e[uen]es of seruantes, 
condicioun of persones, 
vsage of contrajye, and couenable tyme. 
For a kyng scholde be magnificus 
and do grete workes and dedes 
as it is ipreued tofore 
at þe fulle in þe firste book, 
he scholde bere hym semeliche 
to his seruantes 
in good araye 
and in þewe clothinge. 
For þei such thinges schulde not be do 
for brag and boost, 
Ʒut for to kepe kynges and princes in here 
astaat of greet doyng 
and also for þe puple schulde not sette litel by hem, 
it is semelich 
þat þei make 
and do greet workes 
and dedes 
as þe philosofer preueþ, 
vi Poleticorum. 
Þe seconde, in clothinge euenesse 
and liknesse of seruantes moot be knowe. 
For it scholde be knowe 
þat suche seruantes ben kynges men oþer princes 
oþer som oþer lordes, 
sauynge þe condicioun of persones 
þat scholde most take hede 
þat þei ben cloþed of sewte, 
[for] in hous of kynges 
and of princes 
ben many grees of persones; 
þanne alle þat ben þerinne of oo degree, 
oþer not fer atwynne, 
scholde be cloþed in oo sute, 
for it scholde be knowe 
by þe sewte of cloþyng 
þat þe[i] ben seruantes of on prince. 
Þe þridde, 
in prouisioun of cloþynge condiciouns of persones mot be knowe, 
for þey scholde not alle be cloþed iliche. 
For in suche grete hous 
ben not onliche lewede men 
but also clerkes 
and among eyþer ben men 
of diuerse grees and staates, 
þei scholde þerfore be dyuersliche arayed. 
And so we seen in ordre of þe world 
þat al þe world 
is as it were oon hous of þe heiƷest prince 
þat is God, 
as þe philosofer seith playnlich, 
xii Methephisice, 
and in þis hous not | 
alle þynges ben arayed 
iliche noþer ben iliche fayre; 
but by þe consideracioun of þe condicioun of thinges 
summe ben more faire and some lasse faire 
as ordre axeth and riötwisnesse of þe worlde, 
and þerinne þe wonder wisdom 
of þe makere is declared. 
Wherfore in hous of kynges and princes of þe whiche eche 
by diuerse seruantes and office 
may be cleped 
as it were a certeyn world, 
not alle seruantes ben iliche faire icloþed; 
but knowyng þe condicioun of persones 
eche scholde be arayed 
after his owne degree 
and staat for to knowe 
þerby þer prouysioun and wisdom of þe prince. 
Þe ferþe in þis doynge, 
þe vsage of þe contre mot be knowe, 
for al þat is not ivsed semeþ 
as it were foule and not-ordenat. 
For we louen best thingis 
þat we vsen to see of childhood, 
it is iseid, 
vii Poleticorum, 
about þe ende, 
þat alway we louen þe firste more þan oþer. 
And comonliche we seen 
þat men louen so moche vsages of here owne contrees and conuersacion of here owne lond so 
þat þei ben worse 
and fouler þan oþere, 
Ʒut þei holden hem fairere 
and betere þan oþere. 
Þanne in cloþynge 
and in al oþere aray and doynge it is to takynge heede of þe vsage of þe contray 
but þe vsage be corrupt and not worth. 
And [þe fifþe] in þe same, 
me mot take hede of couenable tyme. 
For be cause þat þes neþer bodies 
ben irewled by þe ouer bodies of heuene, 
as tymes chaungyng 
in þe condicions of heuene, 
mete and drynke and cloþing 
and oþer suche þat seruen and helpen to kepe 
and saue þe lif schulde be ichaunged. Chapter XVIII 
It semeth þat curtesye hath hymself to gentelnesse and noblenesse of maners 
as þe vertue iusticia legalis 
hath itself to fulfillynge of þe law. 
For, 
as it schal be knowe in þe processe, 
as þat vertue iusticia legalis | 
is in som manere wise alle vertue, 
for lawe hoteþ 
to fulfille al vertue, 
so curtesie is in som wise al vertue 
for it is iseide 
þat as it were eche vertue 
folweþ gentilesse and noblenesse of maneres. 
And we may distyngwe double noblenesse: 
oon by trowyng and noblenesse of good blood 
(noblenesse to vnderstonde of greet worthinesse 
and gentellesse and noblenesse of blood); 
and anoþer by soþenesse and noblenesse of maners. 
And it semeth þat gentelnesse and noblenesse is igrounded 
in som passynge goodnesse, 
for man scholde neuere be cleped more gentel and noble þan oþere 
but he passede him in som what. 30 f. 115r 35 
Þanne as þer is twey manere greet good – 
for som is iholde greet good [a]s outward good, 
and som is verrey greet good 
as vertues and good of þe soule – so 
þer is double gentelnesse and noblenesse: 
oon þat is igrounded in passynge greet good by oppynyoun and trowynge, 
and þe oþer is igrounded 
in verrey greet good. 
For comynliche þe comyn men and puple perseyuen not but sencible and outward good 
as greet blood, richesse, and cyuel myƷt and power. 
Þanne he þat is icome of gree[t] blood 
as of riche men and myƷty and þat of olde tyme 
so þat men hauen no mynde 
whanne here forefadres were pore men, 
he is icleped a noble man of blood 
and is þerfore iholde a noble man of blood 
and iholde a noble man among þe puple. 
But verrey noblenesse 
is in passynge 
in goodnesse of maners. 
But for fame and loos 
is neuere al ilost 
and what is comynliche iseid 
may not be al fals 
as þe philosofer meneþ, 
vii Ethicorum, 
suche | comyne opynyoun lyneþ vppoun som goodnesse. 
For we seen þat comynliche gentil men 
and noble men of blood 
ben more noble of maners þan oþere. 
For as it is iseid, 
primo Poleticorum, 
as of man comeþ [a] man 
and of bestes comeþ a beest, 
so comynliche of good men 
comeþ good men 
and of wise men comen wise men. 
Þanne for noble men [ben] comynliche with manye men 
and ben as it were expert 
and comynliche more wise þan oþere men, 
for comynliche manye men 
byholden in hym, 
þei ben þe more schamefast to don eny foule doynge. 
And for noble men ben in staat of blood in þe whiche staat 
it is probable and semelich 
þat þei be more wise 
þan oþere men, 
and also by cause of þe staat 
þei scholde be more noble 
þan oþere men, 
Ʒif it is probable and semelich 
þat of good men 
and rightewise comeþ good men 
and of wyse men comen wise men 
and þei þat ben icomen of gentel men and noble ben icleped gentel men and noble by opynyoun for þe opinyoun lenyeþ 
on goodnesse and, 
as it is ischewed, 
it is semelich and probable 
þat suche men ben good men and wise. 
But in stede som tyme of þis goodnesse is falshede, 
for as it is iseide [in] Poletic[is], 
kynde wol do þis and þat 
and is ofte ilette 
and may not but faille. 
For som gentil men of blood gooþ 
out of kynde and out of verrey gentilesse 
and ben worse of maners 
þan oþere men. 
Þanne Ʒif gentelnesse of blood 
is gentelnesse be opynyoun and trowynge 
and gentelnesse of maneres 
is verrey gentelnesse, 
for þei þat ben iholde good scholde be good in dede, 
gentel men of bloode scholde be gentel men of maners. 
And it semeth þat þis | word curtesie comeþ of þis word court, 
for propreliche for to speke court 
is nouƷt elles but hous of noble men and grete; 
and for noble men and grete scholde be noble men of maners, 
þerfore þei 
þat hauen noble maners 
ben icleped curteys men. 
Wherfore curtesye 
may be cleped gentelnesse 
and noblenesse of maners. 30 35 f. 115v 40 
Þanne curtesie is in som wise eche vertue 
in comparisoun to noble- nesse of maners 
as iusticia legalis 
is eche vertue in comparisoun to folwynge of þe lawe. 
For lawe hoteþ 
to do eche vertue as þe lawe hoteþ 
to do no spouse brech, 
þat is þe werk of temporatnesse 
and of chastite; 
and hoteþ to flee not out of þe bataille, 
þat is a work of fortitudo; 
and so of oþere. 
But gentelnesse and noblenesse of maners 
techeþ eche vertue. 
Perfore in som wise curtesie 
is eche vertue. 
For þey ben icleped curteyse 
þat Ʒeuen gladliche skilful Ʒiftes, 
þat is work of liberalte. 
Also þei ben icleped courteise 
þat beren hem semeliche 
in greet spence and cost, 
þat is þe work of magnificencia. 
Also þei ben icleped curteise 
þat eten and drynken in faire manere þat is þe work of temporancia. 
Also men ben icleped curteys 
to here neighbores Ʒif þei doun 
hem no wrong 
in wyves noþer in douƷtres, 
þat is þe work of chastite. 
Also a man is icleped courteys in conuersacioun 
Ʒif he is good to speke wiþ 
and of glad chere to oþere men, 
þat is þe work of goodnesse in spekynge. 
Þanne for to speke to oon, 
in som manere wise curteise 
is eche vertue. 
Þanne while doynge may come of special vertue, 
of iusticia legalis, 
and of courtesye as Ʒif a man Ʒeueþ 
of his good gladliche to his neighbores, 
Ʒif he doþ so for he haþ | likynge in suche doynge, 
þanne he is icleped liberalis; 
but Ʒif he doþ so for to fulfille þe lawe 
as for þe lawe hoteþ so, 
þanne he is icleped iustus legalis; 
but Ʒif he doþ 
auƷt for it 
is þe manere of court and of noble men, 
þanne he is curialis, curteis. 
Also Ʒif þey speken gladliche and goodliche with oþere, 
Ʒif þei don it for suche doynge 
it is plesyng to hym, 
þanne he is icleped affabilis, 
goodlich in spekyng; 
but Ʒif þei doun so 
for to fulfille þe lawe, þanne he is icleped iusticia legalis; 
and Ʒif þei doun 
so for to folwe þe maners 
of court and of gentil men, 
þanne he is icleped curialis, curteys. 
And manye men don workes of vertues and Ʒeuen of here good 
to oþere men and doun not so for likynge 
þat þei hauen in spendynge 
and in Ʒiftes 
as þe liberal man hath, 
noþer for to fufille þe lawe þat hoteþ 
so as iustus legalis doþ, 
but for to folwe þe man[er]es of court 
and of gentile men 
þat scholde Ʒeue Ʒiftes. 
Þerfore suche oon scholde be icleped curialis. 
But it is to wetyng 
þat þeiƷ curialitas, curtesie, 
be in som wise eche vertue, 
Ʒut in a manere passyng wise þei þat ben large of Ʒiftes and curteise of speche ben icleped curiales; 
for in courtes and in hous of gentel men and noble where many men ben 
and þere is comynlich moche outward good, 
nameliche þere moot be greet cost and gentil spekyng. 
For it is declared what is curtesie, 
it may sone be iknowe 
þat seruantes of kynges and princes scholde be curteyse. 
For Ʒif kynges and princes, 
for þei ben in greet staat of noblenesse, schulde haue good maneres and noble and curteyse, 
þanne þe seruantes 
þat | scholde folwe here lordes in good maners 
þei scholde also be good and courteys. 
f. 116r 40 Chapter XIX 
It is declared what manere men scholde be seruantes of kynges and of princes 
for þei scholde 
haue good maners noble and courteys. 
For as citeseyns schulde be laweful and riƷtful 
for to holde and kepe good rewle, 
so for to holde and saue honour 
and worschep of court seruantes of lordes 
scholde be good and curteise. 
Wherfore Ʒif we knowen whiche þe seruantes scholde bee, 
it is to declarynge how kynges and princes 
and alle lordes scholde doo by here seruantes. 
And it semeþ 
þat good manere doynge 
by hem stant in fyve: first, 
þat þei ben wel isette in office; 
þe seconde, 
þat þei ben maad besy in here office; 
þe þridde, 
þat me knowe how me scholde comyne wiþ hem; 
þe ferþe, 
how þei scholde knowe counsaylle and preueyte; 
þe fifte, 
it nedeþ to knowe 
how þei scholde be rewarded. 
Þe firste herof 
is som del declared tofore. 
For Ʒif a seruant 
þat scholde be sette in office scholde be trewe 
þat he do no fraude and wise and redy 
þat no fraude be don to hym, 
þe betere his trouthe 
and his wisdome 
ben iknowe 
in þe grettere office 
þei scholde be sette. 
No man may assay þe goodnesse and trouþe of anoþer 
atte fulle 
but by long tyme, 
as þe philosofer meneþ, 
vii[i] Ethicorum, 
for þere it is iseid 
in a prouerbe þat men knowen not eche oþer 
ar þei spende manye buschels of salt. 
Also þe wisdom and redynesse of a man 
is not iknowe 
atte fulle 
but we see hym do wisliche and rediliche longe tyme. 
Þanne in þis wise seruantes scholde be isette in office: 
first þei scholde be sette in smale offices for to | knowe here trouþe and here redinesse; 
and Ʒif þei beren hem wel þerinne, 
þanne þei mowe be sette in grettere office. 
But it is besiliche to takyng hede 
þat as þe philosofer seith, 
ii Retoricorum, 
comynlich þei þat ben newedliche imaad riche and comen sone 
vp of a lowe astaat 
to an heigh hauen worse maners 
þan oþere. 
Þerfore Ʒif officers of foule blood 
beren hem wel in smale office 
and semen good and trewe and don rediliche Ʒit þei scholde not anoon be 30 isette in to greet office and high but þei scholde come 
vpward by diuerse grees 
and ben assayed long tyme 
or he be sette in hiƷ office. 
It is iknowe how seruantes scholde be isette in office; 
it is to wetynge 
how þei scholde be maad besy in here offis. 
For it is not semelich 
þat grete lordes 
noþer kynges and princes haue 
in here owne persones charge and besynesse of seruantes, 
for as it is iseid, primo Poleticorum, 
þat is not greet doynge. 
Þerfore it is concluded 
þat eche lord scholde voide suche doynge and commaunde 
þat a procuter tak þat werschep, 
and þei lyuen cyuel lif oþer traueillen in philosofie. 
Þanne a kyng oþer a prince 
þat scholde be magnanimus 
scholde do fewe dedes and grete, 
for þei scholde be besy aboute thinges 
þat longen streiƷt 
to þe comyn profit 
and to rewelyng of þe regne – 
and what thinges thilke ben it schal be iseide 
in þe þridde book. 
For it is [not] semelich 
for kynges and princes 
and oþere lordes 
to be besy aboute seruantes 
noþer to entermete of al smale thinges. 
For þis is iseie, it is to declaryng how me scholde do by hem; 
and þat in som wise the philosopher techeth, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
þere he seith 
þat to þe meke magnanimus scholde bere hym moderatliche, 
and | to hem þat ben in dignite magnanimus scholde make hemself greet. 
Þanne a kyng oþer a prince scholde be magnanimus 
to his owne seruantes 
þat ben lowere þan he 
and to þe meke þei scholde schewe hemself moderatliche, 
for as þe philosofer seith playnliche 
þat it is not vertuous dede 
but charious to schewe hymself to hem to excellent. 
And how þe mene and moderat schal be take in suche doyng 
it may be knowe by þe philosofer, 
v Poleticorum, 
þere it is iseid 
þat a prince scholde not seme cruele but reuerent. 
Þanne a prince scholde not be to homlich and bere hym so 
þat his seruantes sette litel by hym so 
þat he seme not a reuerent persone, 
noþer þei scholde seme so excellent 
þat he seme cruel and heuy. 
For as it is iseid [in] Ethic[is], 
in alle doynges þe mene is ipreysed and defaute 
and to moche is blamed. 
But it is to wetyng 
þat som homlichnesse 
is to preysyng in a citeseyn oþer in a knyƷt 
þat is not to presynge in a kyng, 
for kynges and princes scholde 
in alle wise be lasse homelich 
þan oþere and kyþe, 
þat is teche, 
þat þei ben more reuerent persones 
and more worthi 
þan oþere – not for brag and bost, 
but for kynges dignite scholde not be despised. 5 f. 116v 10 15 20 
For it is declared how seruantes scholde be sette in office 
and how þei scholde be besy 
and how me scholde do by hem, 
it is to wetynge 
how þei scholde knowe consayle 
and how þei scholde be rewarded. 
For it is iseid tofore 
þat þer ben diuerse maners of seruauntes, 
for som ben kyndelych seruantes 
and summe by lawe 
and som seruen princi- palliche for huyre 
and som principaliche for loue of þe prince þan for mede. 
Þanne kyndeliche seruantes scholde | not knowe preuey counsaille, 
for as it is iseid tofore, 
no man is kyndelich a seruant 
but he be vnwise and haue lacke of vse of resoun. 
Aboute þe ende primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer speketh of suche seruantes 
and seith 
þat a womman hath feble counsaile 
and a child vnparfit consaille 
and a seruant hath no counsaile. 
Also seruantes by lawe scholde not comynliche knowe preuey counsaile, 
for comynliche suche seruen more 
for drede þan for loue; 
noþer seruantes for huyre scholde knowe preuey counsaille, 
for suche seruantes louen not principaliche þe prince 
but huyre and mede. 
But seruantes þat seruen for loue, 
Ʒif it is iknowe 
by assaye of long tyme 
þat þei ben wel willed, trewe, wise and redy, 
þei mowe knowe preuey counsaille more 
oþer lasse as þe prince knoweþ 
þat þei ben trewe, 
wys and redy. 
And how seruantes scholde be rewarded for here 
traueille it was iseide 
þat it scholde be last itreted 
and may sone be iknowe. 
For kynges and princes may Ʒeue grete Ʒiftes and manye and scholde not wiþholde mede and huyre of seruantes, 
but þei scholde rewarde hem 
and Ʒeue hem more Ʒiftes oþer lasse 
as it is iknowe 
þat þei hauen deserued 
and ben worthi more oþer lasse. Chapter XX 
For it is iseide what seruauntes kynges and princes scholde haue 
and how kyngis and princis 
scholde haue hemself 
to here seruantes, 
it is to wetyng how kynges and princes 
and alle þat eten wiþ hym and seruantis schulde haue hem‡self at mete bordes, 
in spendyng and in talkynge. 
And we may declare by twey weyes 
þat at mete bordes of kynges and of princes 
and of alle noble men 
and of alle cyteseyns 
it is ¦ lacuna 5 [not fitting for there 
to be an abundance of speech. 
The first way is taken 
from the fact 
that this is repugnant to natural order; 
the second from the fact that it is contrary to good morals. 
The first way becomes clear in the following manner. 
For, 
as it is said in the first book of the Politics, 
each thing is then perfected according to nature 
when one organ is ordained to one work. 
In fact, 
as there ought not to be confusion in works of nature, 
because her works are ordained by God Himself 
and by intelligent agents, 
if nature should create the same organ for two works, 
so that there be no confusion in the works 
and 
so that one does not impede the other, 
it is against natural order 
that we should undertake to do one work 
by means of its organ 
if at the same time we do not cease from the other work. 
Wherefore, 
since according to the Philosopher in De Anima, Book III, 
the tongue serves for two works of nature, namely tasting and speaking, 
it is against natural order 
when we exercise such an organ 
for the work 
that consists of tasting, 
as is done at the table 
at the time of eating, 
if at the same time we do not desist 
from the other work, 
which consists of speaking. 
So this is repugnant to natural order. 
In the second place, 
it is repugnant to good morals. 
For if those reclining at the table tend towards much speech, 
since wine seems to increase speech 
and men abounding in wine, 
as if heated and bold, 
gladly burst into words, 
they will seem to be drunk rather than sober. 
So kings and princes, 
whom it befits to be most temperate 
and by all means 
to observe natural order at their tables, 
ought to ordain 
that those reclining not burst into much speech. 
This is also proper for nobles in general 
and for all citizens, 
since it is fitting 
that they too should have a share of virtues and good morals. 
But if it befits those reclining, 
lest natural order be destroyed 
and they appear intemperate, 
to avoid an increase of speech, 
it so befits even the very servants, 
lest the order and the appropriate arrangement of serving be neglected and impeded. 
In fact, 
if at the tables of kings and princes some useful things were read aloud continually, 
so that at the same time as the throats of those reclining take food their ears might receive learning, 
this would be altogether fitting and proper. 
Therefore kings and princes ought to ordain that praiseworthy customs of the kingdom, 
if such have been collected in a book or otherwise in writing, 
be read at the table; 
or also praiseworthy deeds of their predecessors, 
and especially of those who have comported themselves 
in a sacred manner 
and religiously 
with respect to divine things, 
and who have ruled the kingdom justly and in due fashion; 
or that there be read at the table the book De Regimine Principum, 
both so that princes themselves might be instructed 
in how they should rule, 
and that others might be taught 
how to be obedient to princes. 
These things then or other useful things, 
reported in the common idiom 
so that all could be instructed through them, 
would be the things to be read 
at the tables of kings and princes. 
So having dealt with these matters 
concerning the rule of the household, 
although certain other particulars could be treated, 
nevertheless, 
since not all particulars fall under the heading of what should be reported, 
we propose to pass them by in silence, 
putting an end to this second book 
in which we have dealt with the art of domestic rule 
in accordance with the small measure of our knowledge, 
supported by the help of Him 
from whom all goodness and sufficiency have come forth.] 20 [Explicit liber secundus.] Book III Book III Part I DOI: 10.4324/9781315861739-142 [That the community of the city is in a certain way most principal,

How many and what sorts of good things men achieve 
through the establishment of the political community 
which is called a city. 
That man is by nature a civil animal, 
although it befalls some not to live in a civil fashion. By what reasoning it can be proven 
that the state is a natural thing, 
and that man is by nature a political and civil animal. 
That in addition to the community of the city, 
it was a useful thing ío in human life 
that there be a community of kingdom. 
That there are various methods of creating a city and a kingdom, 
and that it is fitting to divide this third book, 
in which conclusions are reached 
ahout this kind of rule, 
into several parts. 
How Socrates and Plato said the city was to be ordered, 
and what they thought about the rule of the city. 
That it is not best for a city 
to possess the maximum of unity and conformity, 
as Socrates and Plato decreed. 
That it is not expedient for the city 
that all things be held in common, 
as Socrates ordained; 
and that kings and princes should know this. 
How many and what sorts of evils would exist in the city 
if wives and children were held in common. 
In what way it is expedient for the city 
that possessions be proper, 
and in what way they should be held in common. 
That kings and princes ought not so to dispose the city 
that women are ordained for works of war, 
as Socrates decreed. 
That kings and princes ought not so to dispose the city 
that the same men are always proposed for the same high offices. 
That the city is not so 
to be ordained 
as Socrates decreed. 
How the opinions of Socrates and Plato 
with regard to the rule of the city 
can be reconciled with good sense. 
How the philosopher Phaleas established 
that the city should be ordered. That it is not best for possessions 
to be made equal, 
as Phaleas decreed. 
That the principal effort of the lawmaker ought to be directed 
to the suppression of covetousness, 
and not to the equalizing of possessions, 
as Phaleas ordained. 
What the policy of Hippodamus was, 
and what Hippodamus established concerning the rule of the city. 
What and how many are the reprehensible things

For eche citee 
is a certeyne comynte, 
sethe þat eche comynte is for som profite, 
a citee mot be ordeyned 
for som good and profit. 
And, primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer preueþ 
by twey weyes 
þat a citee is iordeyned 
for som good and profit. 
Þe firste wey is itake by men 
þat maken þe citee; 
þe seconde, 
by þe citee 
þat is imaad. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For, primo Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat it semeþ 
þat alle dede 
and al eleccioun desiren som certeyn good. 
And, primo Poleticorum, 
it is iwrete 
þat by cause of som what þat semeþ good, 
men doun alle here workes. 
Þanne Ʒif alle men ordeynen here workes 
[by cause of som what þat semeþ good], 
and a citee is work of mankynde, 
by men þat maken þe citee, 
þe cite mot be maad 
by cause of som what þat semeþ good. 
And þis schal not be vnderstonde in þis wise so 
þat a citee is maad 
by cause of good 
oþer of som what þat semeþ good 
and is not imaad 
by cause of som what þat is good in dede. 
For whanne we ordeynen owre workes 
to som what þat is good, 
som tyme we ben inclyned to þat good by kynde and som tyme 
as it were by corrupcioun of kynde. 
And þat good þat alle men desiren 
by kynde semeþ good so 
þat it is good in dede, 
and suche good is makynge of a cite. 
For, primo Poleticorum, 
it is iseid 
þat alle men ben inclyned 
by kynde 
to suche a comyntee 
as is þe comynte of a cite, 
þanne by comparisoun to men 
þat maken þe citee, 
for þei ben kyndelich inclyned to þe makyng herof, 
a cyte is not onlich imade 
by cause of som 
what þat semeþ good but | 
also by cause of som what þat is good in dede. 
Þe seconde wey to preue þe same is itake 
by þe citee imaad 
and by comparisoun to oþere comyntees. 
For þei eche kynde comynte be ordeyned 
to som what þat is good, 
Ʒut þe moste principal comynte 
is most iordeyned to þat good. 
And suche a comynte is comynte of a citee 
þat is more principal comynte 
þan comynte of hous 
oþer of strete. 
Wherfore Ʒif comynte of hous 
is iordeyned 
to som good 
and also to manye manere good, 
as it is preued in þe seconde book 
atte fulle, 
comynte of strete þat is more principal 
þan comynte of hous 
is moche more iordeyned to good. 
And Ʒut þe comynte 
þat is more principal 
þan comynte of hous 
oþer of strete 
is most yordeyned to good. 
And þis is to menynge, primo Poleticorum, 
Ʒif we menen 
þat al comynte is imaad 
by cause of som good and namelich 
þe most principal of alle and most principalliche conteynynge 
alle oþere is imaad 
by cause of som good, 
and þis comynte is comynte politik 
þat is comynliche icleped ciuitas, 
a cite. 
But it is to wetynge 
þat comynte of citee is more principal þan comynte of hous 
oþer of strete 
and so comynte of cite 
is most principal of þre commyntees of hous, strete and citee. 
And anoþer comynte is more principal 
þan comynte of citee 
and þat is comynte of regne 
of þe 
whiche it schal be seid in his owne place. 
And we schal declare þat comynte of regne 
is profitable 
to þe lif of mankynde 
and more principal þan comynte of citee. 
And it semeþ in sum wise 
þat comynte of regne passeþ 
comynte of cite as comynte of citee passeth [comynte of hous oþer of strete]. 
| For as a cite conteyneþ hous and strete 
and is more principal 
þan hous and strete 
and more suffisaunt to þe lif þan comynte of hous and strete, 
so comynte of regne conteyneth comynte of citee 
and is more parfitƷ 
and more suffisaunt to þe lif þan þat comynte. 25 f. 117v 30 Chapter II 
It is not inow to telle 
þat a citee is maad by cause of som good and profit, 
as it is ipreued in þe chapitre tofore, 
but it is declared what good 
and how manye manere good men hauen by makynge of cite. 
And as it longeþ to þis doynge 
þer is þre manere of suche good, 
for a cite is iordeyned 
for to lyue, 
for to wel lyue, 
and for vertuousliche lyue. 
For þe philosofer seith þat lif of þe hole 
is beynge to hem þat lyuen. 
Þanne as it is [other to be] 
other to bee suffisauntliche 
and oþer to be vertuosliche, 
so it is oþer to lyue 
[and other to lyue] 
suffisantliche 
and oþer to lyue vertuosliche. 
For as it is iseid in libro De Causis, 
beynge is most large, 
for þe firste of alle thinges þat ben imaad in al thinges 
hauen beyng in som wyse. 
But not alle thinges hauen suffisant beynge 
but onliche þulke thinges 
hauen suffisant beynge 
þat ben complete and parfit in here owne kynde. 
For Ʒif a þyng lackeþ 
eny perfeccioun 
þat longeþ 
to þe kynde þerof, 
þeiƷ þat þyng myƷt haue som beynge 
as vnparfit beyng 
but it is not iseide 
þat it hath suffisaunt beynge, 
þanne beyng is more large 
þan suffisaunt beynge. 
Also suffisant beynge 
is more large þan vertuous beynge, 
for onliche resonable thing with wit 
and vnderstondyng may haue vertue 
þat is habitus electiuus and morale, 
of þe whiche we thinken to speke heere (habitus electiuus 
is a sad vertue with fre choys). 
And an vn|resonable thing 
oþer soules 
thing may haue suffisant beynge 
Ʒif he hath perfeccioun 
þat longeþ to þe kynde þerof 
and may not haue vertuous beynge 
for it 
may not haue vertues morale. 
Þanne as we distyngwe symple beynge 
and suffisant beyng 
and vertuos beynge, 
so we may distyngwe lyuyng 
and suffisaunt leuyng 
and vertuos leuyng. 
In what staat euere a man be, 
he hath leuynge, 
but hath no suffisaunt leuynge 
but he haue thinges 
þat suffiseth to helpe in bodilich nede. 
Þanne it is oþer to lyue 
and oþer to lyue sufficiantliche. 
Also it is oþer to lyue sufficiantlyche 
and oþer to lyue vertuousliche, 
for manye men hauen sufficiant lifyng and reccheþ 
not to lyue vertuosliche 
for corupte appetite. 
Þanne makyng of cite 
is cause of manye maner good 
and of manye manere greet good, 
for þerby men hauen þe forseide þre manere good. 
For men hauen leuynge 
by comunycacioun politic, 
for þerwiþoute may not a man lyue, 
and we speke of a man leuyng 
as a man and streccheth politik lifynge to leuynge 
by lawes and good vsages and ordenaunce, 
he þat wol not leue so wol not leue as a man, 
but as it is ipreued 
tofore and schal be here after, 
suche oon is worse þanne a man 
oþer better þanne a man for man is kyndelich a politik best and cyuyl 
as it schal be preued. 
Þanne leuyng, 
for to speke of leuynge as a man, 
men hauen leuyng 
by comunicacioun politik 
and by makynge of citee. 
Þe seconde, 
by suche makynge men hauen not onliche leuynge 
but also suffisaunt leuynge. 
For in oon hous oþer in oon strete 
is not ifounde al þat suffiseth to þe lif, 
þerfore is a citee imaad 
in þe whiche | ben manye stretes. 
And in oon strete is smeþes craft, 
in anoþer webbe crafte 
and in anoþer oþer craft 
as vs nedeþ diuerse thinges 
to helpe vs to leuynge. 
For neuere a citee is parfit 
but þei þat dwellen þerinne mowe 
fynde þerinne thinges 
þat suffisen to þe lif. 
Þanne of a citee we hauen not oonliche leuynge 
as a man 
but also suffisant leuynge. 
For Ʒif þe citee is parfit, 
þerinne is al 
þat suffiseth to þe lif. 
Þanne it is wel iseid, primo Poleticorum, þat þe comynte 
þat is a cytee imaad of many stretes 
is a parfit comynte, 
for now as it folweth suche a comyntee 
is imaad for to haue þerinne al 
þat suffiseth to þe lif. 35 f. 118r 40 Þe þridde, 
by makynge of cite we hauen vertuos leuynge. 
For his intencio þat Ʒeueþ lawe and makeþ a citee scholde not oonliche be for cyteseyns scholde haue in þe cite 
what suffiseth to þe lif, 
but also for to leue wel 
by lawe and vertuousliche. 
Þerfore, primo Poleticorum, 
it is iseid 
þat a citee is maad by cause of leuynges and dureþ 
by cause of wel leuynge: 
on caas þe first 
þat meued men 
to make a citee was leuynge 
and haue sufficiant leuynges. 
Sayeng þat in solitarie leuyng þei myƷt not be sufficiant to hemself in lif, 
þei made a cite for on scholde helpen anoþer 
to sufficiant leuynge. 
And whanne þe citee was imaad, 
men took better heede and siƷe þat it is not inow to haue suffisant leuynge 
but þer be also vertuos leuynge. 
For wiþoute lawe and rightwysnese 
þe cite myƷte not stonde, 
þei ordeyned comunycacioun politik 
þat was imaad for leuynge and for to haue suffisaunt leuynge 
to lyue good lif 
and to lyue by lawe and vertuousliche. 
Þanne Ʒif we hauen so moche 
and so many maner good | 
by makynge of cite, 
it is wel iseide, primo Poleticorum, 
þat þe firste þat made cite 
was cause of most good. Chapter III 
On caas som man wolde meue a doute Ʒif a cite 
is som what by kynde and Ʒif a man is kyndelich politic, 
a cyuel best. 
For þing þat is by kynde 
abideþ alwey and in eche place, 
as fuir hetiþ alway and in ech place Ʒif þer is ouƷt to fonge his heete. 
Wherfor Ʒif a cite 
were som what by kynde and Ʒif a man were kyndeliche a cyuel beste, 
eche man were cyuel. 
But we seen þat many men 
forsaken politik companye and chesen solitarie 
lif and lyuen alone in desert. 
But it semeþ 
þat þese doutes 
and oþere suche comen of vnconnynge, 
for som knowen not what wise 
it is kyndeliche to man 
to be a cyuel beste. 
For þat is not kyndelich to man 
in þe same wise 
as it is kyndelich to þe fyre for to hete and to a stoun 
for to meue adounward, 
for such doyng ben so kyndelyche to fuyre and stoon 
þat þei mowe not vse þe contrarye 
but þei ben kyndeliche 
to hem alwey 
and in eche place. 
For neuere a stoon myƷte 
so ofte be þrowe vpward 
þat he scholde vse 
by hýmself to meue vpward, 
þanne alwey þe stoon doþ 
what is in hym to meue dounward 
and þe fuyre heteþ alwey. 
But man is not in þat wise kyndeliche a cyuel beest, 
but he is icleped kyndelych 
a cyuel beest 
for he hath a certeyn appetite and kyndelich able to lyue ciuel lyf. 
And thinges þat ben in þis wise kyndeliche mowe be lette 
by som happe oþer by som cause, 
as þei it be kyndeliche to man 
to be riƷt honded Ʒit 
ma[n]y men ben boþe riƷt honded and lift honded. 
Soþey it be kyndelich toman to lyue cyuel lyf 
and in comynte, 
Ʒut many men forsaken cyuel Iif 
and Ieuen in desert. 
And, primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer toucheþ þre | wherfore 
som men forsaken cyuel lif and companye. 
Þe firste is fortune; 
þe seconde, passynge schrewednesse; 
þe þridde, goodnesse. 
And som men leuen not cyuel lyf and þat is by cause of fortune, 
as for þei ben to pore 
and mowe not lyue cyuel lyf but þei ben compelled to go out of þe cite and tylye lond. 
Þe seconde, 
wherfore a man 
is som tyme not cyuel is passynge schrewednesse. 
For som men ben so euel willed 
þat þei mowe not lyue 
in a cyte by lawe and goþ 
þerfore som tyme out of þe citee. 
And Ʒif þei gone not out, 
þei ben som tyme iput out 
and somme tyme ibanesched. 
Primo [Polet]icorum <capitulo tercio>, 
þe philosofer spekeþ 
of suche men and seide þat Omerus cursede hem and seide, 
Cursede be þe vnfelowlich man 
vnlaweful and mysdoere and desireþ cocky 
and is as it were 
wiþoute Ʒok 
as bryddes and foules. 
Þe þridde, 
som me lyuen not cyuel lif 
in cite for passynge goodnesse. 
Cyuel lyf is good lyf 
and lif of wedloc 
is good lif 
to lyue as man. 
But som men ben so parfit 
þat it is not inow to hem to lyue as men 
but þei forsaken wedlok 
and cyuel lyf 
and taken a more parfit lif. 
For þei he do wel þat wyuen and lyuen cyuel lif, Ʒut he doþ bettere 
þat wyuen not noþer 
lyuen cyuel lif for þei wol 
þe more freliche lyue 
in Goddes seruyce 
and in contemplacioun. 
Þanne man is kyndeliche a cyuel best not wiþstondynge 
þat som men lyuen not cyuel lyf. 
For eche man 
þat lyueþ not cyuel lyf, 
but it be for pouerte oþer for fortune, 
it is for he is a best 
and euel doere wiþoute Ʒok 
and may not lyue 
vnder lawe noþer in companye; 
oþer he is as it were a god 
and cheseth þe more parfit lyf. 
Þerfore it is iwrete, primo Poleticorum, 
þat he þat may not comyne wiþ | 
oþere men noþer be in companye 
hath no part of a cite 
but he is a beeste oþer a god. Chapter IV 
In þe [nexte] chapitre 
ben contrarie obieccions and argumentes 
iput of by þe 
whiche it semed ipreued 
þat a cite 
is not kyndelich noþer man 
kyndelich a cyuel beste. 
Þanne for it is not inow to putte of argumentes 
and contrarie obieccions 
þat ben aƷenste certeyn soþenesses and trowþe 
but þer ben also propre resons 
ymaad to preue 
þat soþenesses and trouthe, 
in this chapitre we thinken to make resons to preue 
þat a cite 
is som what by kynde 
and þat a man is kyndeliche a cyuel beeste. 
And by twey weyes we may preue 
þat a cyte 
is som what by kynde. 
Þe firste wey is itake 
for a cyte ordeyneþ hous and strete. 
Þe seconde, 
for a cyte is þe ende of hous and of strete, 
for þey ben ymade 
for þat ende to haue a cyte. 
And it is ipreued tofore 
þat leuynge is kyndeliche to men 
and þat kynde failleþ not to man in þynges 
þat ben nedful to suffisant lyuynge. 
Þerfore ai þat helpeþ 
to suffisaunt leuynge of mankynde 
mot be som what by kynde. 
Þanne comynte of hous and comynte of strete 
ben kyndelich comyntees 
for þei helpen to suffisant lyuynge of mankynde. 
Þanne for comynte of cite conteyneþ 
þes comyntees and helpeþ 
to suffisant leuynge more parfitliche 
þan doþ þylke comyntees, 
wherfore comynte of cite mot be kyndeliche comynte. 
Þe seconde wey is itake for a cyte is þe ende of þe forseide comyntees and parfitnesse þerof. 
For as þe pholosofer argueþ, primo Poleticorum, 
þe ende of generacioun of kyndeliche thinges 
is kyndelich and is þe kynde of hem 
þat ben igendred, 
as þe ende of generacioun | 
of man is kyndelich and his kynde. 
For þe ende of generacioun 
is þe forme and schap 
and is kyndelich by a figure 
þat hatte antonomasia, 
þe ende is þe silf kynde. 
And we seen also þat comynte of hous 
is kyndeliche not onliche 
for it helpeth to suffisant leuynge 
but also for comyntees 
þat maken hous parfit ben kyndeliche comyntees. 
And hous conteyneth comynte of housebonde and wif, 
of lord and seruant, 
of fader and sone, 
and eche þerof is kyndeliche comynte. 
Also comynte of strete is kyndelich comynte not onlyche 
for it helpeþ 
to suffisant leuynge 
but also for þe generacioun 
þerof is kyndelich. 
For a strete is igendred 
by encresyng of children and of nevewes, 
as þe philosofer meneþ, primo Poleticorum, 
wherfore Ʒif suche encresynge is kyndelich, 
a strete is also kyndelich. 
Þanne a citee is kyndeliche 
for it is þe ende of hous and strete; 
for it is þe ende of generacioun of kyndelich þynges, 
generacion of hous and strete 
is iordeyned to a cyte 
as to þe ende and parfitnesse þerof. 10 f. 119r 15 20 25 
For it is iknowe þat a cyte 
is som what by kynde, 
it is to declarynge 
þat man is kyndeliche a cyuel beest and politik – 
þat is to menynge desposed to dwelle in cyte 
and in laweful comynte. 
And þat we may also preue by twey weyes. 
Þe firste is itake by speche. 
Þe seconde, 
by kynde inclinacioun. 
In þe bygynnyng of þe seconde bookit 
is ipreuedby speche 
þat man is kyndelich a companable beest, 
for by speche we hauen techynge and loore. 
And heere we may preue by speche 
þat man is kyndelich politik and cyuel beest, 
for þe voyce of man þat is speche tokeneth oþer 
wi|se þan vois of oþere beestes. 
Þerfore þe philosofer, primo Poleticorum, 
seith þat in oþere bestes here 
kynde is so isette so 
þat þe voyse is so to hem tokne of likynge and displesyng so 
þat by þe voise 
þei knowen plesynge and displesynge, 
for by þe voyce it is iknowe 
wheþer he be plesed 
oþer greued. 
For þe hound berkeþ oþer wyse 
whanne he is iplesed 
þanne whanne he is igreued, 
and by his berkyng oþer houndes knowen 
wheþer he is iplesed oþer igreued. 
But here ouer man haþ speche 
by þe whiche it is distinctlich iknowe what is good and what is euel, 
what is riƷtful and what is wrong. 
Þanne Ʒif comynte of hous 
is iordeyned for to haue 
þat is good and to voide euel and þerouer comynte of cyte 
is iordeyned 
to haue rigt 
and to voyde wrong, 
comynte of hous and of cite 
mot be kynde comynte. 
For Ʒif kynde geueþ men speche kyndeliche, 
it is þe comynte 
þat is iordeyned 
to þynges 
þat scholde be treted by speche. 
And riƷt and wronge is not propreliche 
in comynte of hous 
but in comynte of cite. 
For in a cyte where inne citeseyns hauen propre possessions and distincte [ben] ofte plee and stryif, 
what is right and 10 what is wrong, 
and þat is not proprelich 
in an hous 
þere alle thinges longeþ to the housebonde. 
Cyte and hous ben diuerse for in a cite 
is not onliche thing 
þat helpeþ and greueþ 
but also socour of riƷt and of wrong. 
But eyþer comynte is kynde comynte, 
bothe comynte of hous and of cite, 
for by speche 
þat we hauen of kynde 
we knowen good and euel, riƷt and wrong. 
Þe seconde wey to preue þe same is itake by kynde inclinacion, 
for alle bestes haþ kynde inclinacioun 
to saue þynges 
þat þei hauen of | kynde. 
Wherfore Ʒif kynde 
geueþ man leuynge, 
he geueþ hym kynde inclinacioun 
todo thinges 
by þe whiche he may hauesuffisant leuynge. 
And þe philosofer seith that þat may be best 
by comynte of cite, 
for a cyte scholde conteyne al þat nedeþ to þe lyf. 
Þanne men hauen kynde inclynacioun to lyfe politik lif, 
laweful comynte, 
and to make a cyte. 
But for thing þat we desiren kyndeliche 
is sum what kyndelich and by kynde, 
a cytee moot be som what kyndelich and by kynde. f. 119v 20 Chapter V 
By þre weyes we may preue 
þat passynge comynte of cyte 
it is profitable to lif ‡ of mankynde 
to ordeyne comynte of regne. 
Þe firste wey is itake 
by suffisaunt leuyng; 
þe seconde, 
by hauynge of vertues; 
þe þridde, 
by defence and wiþstondynge of enemyes. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For þe philosofer seith, primo Poleticorum, 
þat parfit comynte 
þat is a cyte 
imaad of manye stretes 
is ende of al þat suffiseth 
by itself to þe lif. 
And schal not be soo vnder- stonde 
þat alwey a cytee haþ of þe propre possessions 
þerof al þat nedeþ to þe lif 
but it is inow 
þat a cyte be so isette 
þat it may haue a suffisant leuynge 
by marchaundise 
and by cariage 
and by wyt of mankynde. 
Þanne as a strete 
þat hath smyþes craft 
haþ nede to a strete 
þat haþ webbe craft, 
for to suffisaunt leuynge men neden boþe smethes and webbes, 
so for som cytees hauen inow of oon manere thing 
for somme citee hauen wyne inowg and lacken corn 
and oþere citees hauen corn inow, 
oo citee nedeþ helpe of anoþer. 
Wherfore as it is profitable 
to þe lif of mankynde to haue diuerse stretes 
in oon cytee | 
for to haue þe sonnere 
what nedeþ to þe lif, 
so it is profitable to haue many citees 
vnder on principate oþer on regne 
þat þei mowe 
þe better helpe eche oþer of thinges 
þat nedeþ to þe lif. 
For as diuerse lymes of þe bodye 
hauen not þe same doynge 
but oon nedeþ doynge of anoþer 
wherfore it is good 
þat þe lymes be ifere in o body 
þat þei mowe helpe eche oþer, so not for alle citees 
hauen plente of þe same thinges, 
it is good þat citees be vnder oo regne þat þei mowe þe bettere helpe eche oþer of þynges 
þat nedeþ to sufficiant leuynge. 
Þe seconde wey to preue 
þe same is itake by hauynge of vertues. 
For þe entent of hym þat Ʒeueþ lawe 
as it is iseid tofore scholde not onliche be for citeseyns scholde haue what nedeþ to helpe at bodilich nede, 
but also þei scholde lyue by lawe and vertuousliche. 
And þe betere þe soule 
is passyng þe body 
and more vertuous workes passen outward gode, 
þe more þ’entent of hym 
þat Ʒeuen þe lawe scholde be for to lyue vertuousliche. 
Þanne þe rector of a citee mot haue cyuyl 15 myƷt and power 
þat he may compelle hem 
þat wol not lyue vertuous- liche 
and hem 
þat disturblen þe pees 
and good astaat of þe citeseyns. 
For euele men 
in a citee dar not arise aƷenste þe prince Ʒif þei knowen 
þat he hath greet cyuel myƷt 
and power and lordschipe of manye citees. 
Ʒif it is iknowe 
þat a prince rewleþ riƷtfulliche and bycomeþ not 20 a tyrand, 
it is spedful to citeseyns for to lyue vertuousliche 
and for schrewednesse of euel men 
to be gedered vnder oo regne. 
But Ʒif þe prince wol be a tyrand, 
þe lasse myƷt and power 
he hath þe better it is for þe cytee. 
Þe þridde | wey to preue þe same is itake by defense 
and wiþstondynge of enemyes. 
For we seen þat whanne a citee 
is ouersette wiþ enemyes 
and makeþ confederacioun 
and couenant wiþ anoþer citee 
þat he may þe better 
withstonde þe rees of enemyes; 
þanne for a regne is as it were a confideracioun 
and couenant of manye citees for to be ioned vnder o kyng 
þat schal defende eche partie of þe regne and ordeyne cyuel myƷt and power of oþere citees to defence of eche cytee of þe regne Ʒif it is ouersette wiþ strangers, 
for þe better defence and socoure it is good of many comyntees of citees to ordeyne oon comynte of a regne. f. 120r 25 Chapter VI 
We may assigne twey manere generacions 
of citee and of regne and eiþer þerof is kyndeliche in som wise; 
nathalees þe oon is more kyndelich 
þan þe oþer. Of þe firste manere we made mencioun in þe seconde book, 
þere we seide þat 
by encresynge of children, sones, and nevewes, 
an‡ hous may encrese in to a strete and a strete in to a cite and a cite in to a regne. 
Anoþer manere is by accord of hem 
þat maken a citee oþer a regne. 
For as þe philosofer reherseth, 
ii Poleticorum, 
in oolde tyme men wonede fer atwynne, 
as in Aristotles tyme, 
and þat was amonge certeyne men þat weren icleped Archades – among hem eche wonede by hymself. 
Þan men þat wonede so desparkled accordeden in a tyme and made hem a cytee and wonede þerinne 
þat þei myƷte þe bettere haue what nedeþ 
to help to þe lyfe. 
Þanne a regne myƷte be maad 
in þis wise 
[i]f manye citees and townes dreden | myƷt of enemyes and accorden to be vnder oo kyng. 
Eyþer of þis maners is kyndelich, 
but þe firste is more kyndeliche 
þan þe seconde. 
Þe firste makynge of cite 
and of regne is kyndeliche in double wise. First, 
for it is imaad by generacioun 
þat ‡is work of kynde. 
Þe seconde, 
for men hauen kynde inclinacioun to make citee and regne. Ʒif children and nevewes encresen in on hous by generacioun so 
þat þei mowe not dwelle al ifere þerinne 
and maken hem many howses 
and so þei make a strete 
and cresseþ more and more so 
þat þei may not dwelle al in oon strete 
and makeþ hem many stretes 
and maken so citees 
and maken many citees 
and maken so a regne, 
‡ suche makynge of citee and of regne is most kyndelich not onlich for men hauen kynde inclinacioun 
to suche makyng 
but also for suche makynge comeþ 
a generacioun of children 
þat is work of kynde. 
Þe seconde manere makynge of regne and of citee is 
whan men accorden to suche makynge 
and suche makynge is kyndeliche. 
ÞeiƷ it be not kyndeliche 
as þe firste manere makynge, 
nathales it is kyndelich. 
For by cause of leuynge men hauen kynde inclinacioun 
and accorden 
to make a citee 
in þe whiche is suffisant leuynge; 
and hauen also kynde inclinacioun 
to make a principate and a regne, 
for by suche makynge 
þei mowe lyue þe better in pees 
and þe bettere wiþstonde here enemyes 
þat wolde rese on hem wiþ violence. 
Þanne suche inclynacioun is kyndelich; 
for as men hauen kynde inclinacioun to lyue and to haue suffisant lyuynge 
and þat is by companye of cite, 
so þei hauen kynde inclinacioun 
to lyue in pees 
and to wiþstonde ligtliche here enemyes. | 
And þat is by companye of principate and of regne, 
for we seen þat citees 
þat ben not vnder oo kyng hauen ofte greet discord 
and stryf eche wiþ oþer. 
For twey maners of generacions of citee and of regne 
ben irekened and eyþer þerof may be cleped 
kyndelich maner of generacioun of cite and of regne, 
we may adde þe þridde manere þat is as it were sympliche violent. 
For whan men wonede disparpled, 
on myƷte arise by tyrandise 
and be lord ouer hem by violence; 
and whanne he were lord ouer hem, 
he myƷte gadere hem by violence 
and make hem make a citee. 
Also a regne myƷte be imaad by violence 
and by tyrandise 
as Ʒif oon lord of oo citee 
ouersetteþ by tyrandise, 
by cyuel myƷt and power, 
and maken hemself kyng þerof. 
It is iknowe þat þer ben diuers maneres of generacioun of cite and of regne 
and it is to wetynge 
in how many parties þe þridde book mot be departed 
in þe whiche we schal trete 
of al suche rewelyng. 
Hit is declared þat kynde generacioun of citee 
and of regne is iordeyned to 5 lyue wel 
and to lyue in pees 
and to withstonde enemyes 
þat wolde desturble 
þe pees and ouersette and take citees. 
It is to declaryng 
how a citee and a regne myƷte 
wel be irewled 
in tyme of [pees, 
and how enemyes myƷte be assaied 
in tyme of] werre. 
But as þe philosofer seith, 
ii Methaphisicorum, 
and aboute þe ende Elenarum, 
no man suffiseth to hymsilf to fynde art in craft but eche mot be holpe 
by helpe of hem 
þat souƷte tofore 
som knowynge of suche art. 
Þerfore in suffisant art of rewelyng of citee and of regne it 
nedeþ to reherce what philosofrers 
in oold tyme menede 
of suche rewelyng | 
and how cytees were ireweled in olde tyme, 
for þerby we schal be lad 
in som wise to knowe what is 15 good 
and what is not good 
in rewelynge of regne and of citee. 
Þanne alle þis þridde book 
we schal dele in þre parties, 
for firste we schal telle opynyons of philosofres in rewelyng of citees 
and what þei seide amys 
in suche rewlyng schal be repreued. 
Þanne first, 
we scholde reherse ordenance of olde philosofres 
in suche rewelinge 
þat kynges and princes mowe be lad 
þerby how þei scholde rewele citees and regnes. 
Þe seconde, 
it schal be declared 
whiche is best policie 
and rewelyng 
and what cautels princes scholde vse 
and how citee and regne scholde be rew[el]ed 
in tyme of pees for suffisaunt and vertuous leuynge. 
Þe þridde, 
it schal be declared how fiƷtynge men scholde be chose 
and how enemyes scholde be assaied 
and how schiltroms in bataille scholde be iordeyned 
and what cautels fiƷtyng men scholde vse aƷenst enemyes in mortel batailles. Chapter VII 
While Socrates traueillede long in philosofie 
and aboute kyndes of thinges 
and seye þat in natural science 
is greet difficulte, 
as þe philosofer telleþ in Metaphisica sua, 
he tumede hym to moral matere. 
And his disciple Plato folwede hym 
in manye doynges 
and [þe philosofer] 
clepede þerfore Plato 
þe seconde Socrates. 
Socrates and Plato tretede of moral matere 
and touchede of fyue poyntes of cite 
and of rewelyng of cite. First, 
þei seide þat a citee scholde be most oon, 
and trowede so oon caas for alwey multitude comeþ of vnyte and alwey vnyte semeth betere þan multitude. 
Þerfore for | God is most oon, 
it is argued þat he is most good; 
þanne it semeþ 
þat a citee is most good Ʒif it is most oon. 
Þanne þe more it draweþ to vnyte, 
þe more it neiƷeth to þe ende of goodnesse. 35 f. 121r 40 Þe seconde, 
þe forseyde philosofers ordeyned reulyng of cite and seide 
þat alle þynges scholde be comyne to þe citeseyns so 
þat alle possessions and wyues scholde be comyn so þat eche man scholde take eche womman 
and so þe children scholde be comyn. 
For by cause of comyne vse of wymmen, 
þe faders scholde be not certeyn 
of here owne children; 
but he scholde trowe 
þat alle children 
were here owne children. 
For Socrates and Plato menede þat al þe stryf of citeseyns 
comeþ of propre possessions, 
for eche fondeþ to saye þis is myn. 
Wherfore þei argewede Ʒif possessions 
were comyne and citeseyns hadde nouƷt in propre, 
plee and stryf scholde cese 
and so a citee were best yordeyned. 
Also þei wolde þat wifes scholde be comyne, 
for þerof scholde come loue most among citeseyns. 
For Ʒif þe wifes 
were not propre but comyne, 
þanne þe children scholde be comyn; 
and for fadres louen best here owne children, 
in þat citee scholde be most loue 
for þe elder men 
schulde loue al þe Ʒongere men 
as here owne children 
and þe Ʒonger men 
scholde loue al þe eldere men 
as here owne fadres. 
And also þei seide þat wifes and children 
scholde wel lyue 
in þat wise 
to haue most vnyte 
and acord in þe citee. 
For by cause of most vnyte 
and most acord is bytwene fadres and childdren, 
þat olde men wolde trowe 
þat þei hadde most acord 
wiþ þe Ʒongere men 
and aƷenward for þe eldere men | wolde trowe 
þat Ʒongere men 
were here owne children 
and þe Ʒongere wolde trowe 
þat þe eldere were here owne fadres. 
Þe þridde, 
in rewelyng of citee 
þe forseide philosofres seide 
þat wymmen scholde leme dedes of armes 
and fiƷte in bataille as men doþ. 
And as þe philosofer seith, 
ii Poleticomm, 
þei brouƷte herto doynge of oþere bestes and foules; 
for þei seye doyng of oþere beestes 
in þe whiche not onlich maal and femel fiƷteþ 
but also in beestes 
and in foules 
þat leuen by raueyne 
þe femel is more strong þan þe maal. 
For Ʒif we taken heede of foules 
þat lyuen by raueyne, 
þe femel is more greet of body 
and more blood of herte 
þan þe male, 
as it fareth of þe goshauk, 
of þe faucoun, 
and of þe egle, 
and of oþere suche 
and of suche femels 
þat ben more worthi 
þanne here owne mawles. 
Wherfore Ʒif we seyen among oþere beestes 
þat not onliche þe maal fiƷteþ 
but also þe femal 
for it semeþ most by ‡ þe ordre of kynde in þe whiche we comynen with oþere beestes, 
it semeþ þat a cite i[s] most kyndelich yordeyned 
Ʒif not onliche men ben iordeyned 
to do dedes of armes 
but also wymmen. 
Þe ferþe, 
þei seide þat alwey 
þe same men 
scholde be princes and officers in a citee so 
þat þei þat were officers 
scholde alwey be officers 
and þei þat were meyres 
scholde alwey be meyres 
and so of oþer officers and baylefs. 
And þei toke ensaumple of þe erþe, 
for we seen þat partes of þe erþe 
þat hauen a veyn of syluer hauen alwey suche a veyn and þe parties 
þat hauen a veyn of gold 
hauen alwey suche a veyn. 
Þanne Ʒif kynde tumeþ not a veyne of gold 
in to a veyn | 
of siluer noþer 
in to a veyn of iren noþer agenward, 
we doun wel Ʒif we folwen doynge of workes of kynde. 
And nameliche a citee 
is wel ireweled 
Ʒif we folwen þe ordre of kynde 
and change not þe veyn of gold 
as þe grete princes 
and þe veyne of siluer 
as þe lasse princes 
in to a veyn of ire so 
þat þe grete princes scholde not be sette doun noþer imaad sogette. 40 f. 121v 5 
Þe fifte, 
þe forseide philosofres seide 
þat eche cite scholde be deled in fif parties: 
plowƷ men, craftes men, men of armes, consaillours and princes. 
And þei seide þat plowƷ men were nedful 
to þe citee for thinges 
þat nedeþ to mete and drynke. 
Craftes men ben nedful for cloþynge and hous 
and oþere thinges 
þat nedeþ to þe lif. 
And worrious ben nedful for defence of þe citee 
and for to putte of enemyes. 
And þei seide þat a cite Ʒif it were wel iordeyned most haue a þousand fiƷtyng men atte leste and fif þousand atte moste. 
And princes and consaillours ben nedful 
in a citee for to rewle þe citeseins to lyue vertuousliche 
and to kepe wel þe lawe. 
And þe forseide philosofres toucheþ 
oþere poyntes of rewelyng ‡ 
of citee of þe whiche mencioun schal be maad Ʒif we fynden place. Chapter VIII 
Most euenest equalite 
and vnite nedeþ 
not to be in al þynges; 
for Ʒif al þynges were euene peres, 
þanne þei were nouƷt al thinges. 
And for to haue al þynges 
þat nedeþ for to make þe world most parfit in þe state þerof, 
it nedeþ to haue thinges of diuerse kynde. 
For þe hole good- nesse of þe world 
may not be to saue ⌜in on maner kynde, 
it nedeþ to haue þynges of diuerce kynde; 
for⌝⌜in þynges of manye maner kynde [ben] kepte and isaued⌝⌜more perfeccioun⌝ þanne onlich 
in a þyng of on kynde. 
Also a citee for to be parfite it nedeþ to haue som diuersete 
and it nedeþ not to haue þerþnne 
al manere euenesse (equalite) 
and accord as Socrates and Plato wolde mene. 
And, ii Poleticorum, þe philosofer toucheþ 
as it were sex resons preuyng þat it nedeþ not þat a citee be most oon and most accordynge. 
Þe first is itake 
by beynge of þe cite. 
Þe seconde, 
by comparisoun to an oost. 
Þe þridde, 
by comparisoun to þe partyes. 
Þe ferþe, 
to comparisoun to princes and sogettes. 
Þe fifte, 
by comparisoun to þe ende. 
Þe sexte, 
by comparisoun to þynges 
þat 35 we seen in oþere tuenes, 
acorde and melodye. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wyse, 
for on singuler man 
haþ more vnyte þan al an hous and an hous more þan a strete and a strete more þan a citee and a citee more þan a regne; 
for an hous is maad of many persones 
and a strete of many houses 
and a citee of many stretes 
and a regne of manye citees. 
Þanne Ʒif an hous were so ioned 
þat al þe persones 
þerof were oo persone, 
þan were it not on hous 
but a singuler man. 
Also Ʒif a strete were so ioned 
þat it were on hous, 
þanne were it not a strete. 
And in þe same wise [i]f a citee were so iooned 
þat it were oon strete oþer on hous, 
þanne it were no citee, 
for in a citee nedeþ diuersite; 
and Ʒif þat diuersite failleþ, 
þe cite is no citee. 
Panne it is al oon to saye 
þat in a citee 
oþer in a regne schulde be al manere vnyte 
and to saye 
þat a cite is no citee 
and þat a regne is no regne. 
Þe seconde wey to preue 
þe same is itake 
by comparisoun to an oost 
or to fiƷtynge men arayed to fiƷte. 
For as it is iseid, 
ii Poleticorum, 
suche arayunge 
and cite ben diuerse; 
for suche araye is more profitable and lasse profitable 
as it is more oþer lasse þeiƷ it be þe same þyng in kynde, 
for suche araye is imaad by cause | 
of help and socour. 
For as manye men trauelen a schip betere þan oon þeiƷ þilke manye men 
be al of oon 
manere and ileche and accordynge, 
so manye men fiƷtten bettere þan oon. 
And it is not so 
of a citee 
but a cite is iordeyned for suffisant lyuynge. 
Þanne for vs nedeþ dyuerse þynges for oure leuynge, 
in a cytee moot be diuersetee. 
10 f. 122r 15 
Þe þridde wey declarynge for þe forseide weyes is itake to comparisoun of þe parties. 
For as þe same bodye 
nedeþ dyuerse doynges 
as goynge, touchinge, siƷt and huyrynge, 
þerfore in þe bodye 
nedeþ diuerse membres and lymes for dyuerse doynges. 
So for to oure leuynge vs nedeþ hous, 
cloþynge, mete, and drynke, 
and oþere suche, 
in a citee mot be som diuersete 
for to haue þerinne suffisant leuynge. 
Þanne as Ʒif no diuersetee 
were in membres of þe body, 
as Ʒif alle þe membres were eyƷene, 
þe body were vnparfit; 
for þeiƷ he myƷte see, 
he myƷt noþer huyre ne goo. 
So Ʒif most liknesse and acord were in a cytee so 
þat Ʒif alle were webbes 
oþer alle coriours, 
þe citee were vnparfit. 
For to suffisaunt leuynge vs nedeþ 
not onlich schone and clothynge 
but also vs nedeþ 
mete and drynke and hous and oþere thinges 
þat nedeþ to þe lif. 
Þe ferþe wey is itake 
by comparisoun to prynces and sogettes. 
For by cause þat a cite 
is a manere ordre of citeseyns 
to a certeyn prince and lord, 
and for in a citee 
mot be certeyn officers and maistres lasse and more 
and þat may not be but som were lordes and somme sogettes, 
and for þis nedeþ dyuersete, 
in a citee mot be som dyuersetee. 
Þe fifte wey is itake 
by comparisoun to þe ende wherfore 
þe citee is imaad, 
| for þe citee is imaad 
for to lyue wel 
and to haue suffisant leuynge. 
For a citee is a comyntee 
þat hath ende of al þat is of itsilf suffisant lyuynge, 
but as it is iseid 
to suffisant leuynge 
nedeþ dyuerse thinges, 
þerfore in a citee [ben] sum diuersetee and diuerse stretes 
as it is spedful to þe lif so 
þat thinges 
þat ben not ifounde in oo strete may be founde in anoþer. 
Þe sexte wey is itake 
in comparisoun to tuenes and melodye. 
For melodye þat is þe multitude of voyce 
is neuere wel proporcionate Ʒif 
alle þe voices ben euene ileche; 
but to good melodye 
nedeþ diuersete of tuenes. 
Also peynture is neuere wel iordeyned 
but þerinne be di- uerse colours. 
So a cite is neuere wel iordeyned 
but þerinne be diuerse officers. 
Þanne kynges and princes scholde knowe þat 
in a cite scholde be dyuersete, 
for neuere man can rewle wel a citee 
but he knowe how a cite is iordeyned and how þerinne mot be diuersetee. Chapter IX 
In principlis speche mot be long, 
for a litel errour in þe bygynnyng 
is most in þe endyng. 
Þerfore principles mot be longe itreted 
and declared with long speche 
lest errour falle þere among. 
Wherfore by cause þat in rewelyng of citee first polici 
and manere of rewelyng 
mot be iordeyned, 
it mot be long itreted 
and declared how a citee mot be oon 
and what diuersete mot be þerinne 
and how citeseyns schal bere hemself 
eche to oþer 
and wheþer 
alle þynges scholde be comyn to hem oþer no 
and what þei scholde haue propre. 
For þese ben as it were certeyn principles 
and preambules to þynges 
þat schal be preched. 
And in þis chapitre first we | wol declare þat it nedeþ 
not to alle thinges be comyne in a cite 
as Socrates ordeyned noþer thinges 
folwen þat Socrates seide Ʒif a citee 
were so iordeined. 
For ‡ he trowede þat 3¿f alle possessions, 
wyues and children were comyneþanne þei scholde al strif and plee ceese, 
and Ʒif citeseyns trowede þat alle children 
were here owne children 
þanne scholde be most loue in þe citee. 
By þre weyes we may declare þat þis is not spedful 
to þe citee: 
first, 
for strif and plee scholde not ceese; 
þe seconde, 
for citeseyns wolde not trowe 
þat alle children were here owne; 
þe þridde, 
for among hem were not most loue. 15 f. 122v 20 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For were possessions neuere so comyne, 
Ʒut þe vse of þynges 
þat longeþ 
to þe liflode scholde be propre; 
for as it may not be 
þat Ʒif alle þe citeseyns 
were on real body imaad, 
so it may not be þat þe same mete 
þat norescheþ þe body of oon citeseyn scholde noresche þe body of anoþer. 
And Ʒif possessions were comyn, 
it were nede to dele 
to eche thinges 
þat þat nedeþ to sustenaunce of þe body. 
And for a man is gretliche disceyued 
in his owne propre profit, 
alwey it wolde seme hym 
þat he scholde fonge 
more þan þei fongen. 
And for it is inposcible 
þat alle citeseyns 
be liche good and liche wys and redy and iliche profitable to þe cite, 
anon þere scholde arise stryf among citeseyns. 
For eche scholde trowe 
þat þei scholde fonge more þan þei fongen, 
for on citeseyn wolde holde hymself better þanne anoþer 
and wolde be rewarded 
as þei were worthi. 
And it were not poscible 
to kepe suche euenesse 
and | equalite among citeseyns 
wiþoute stryf and plee, 
for eche is disceyued 
and tellen mor of hemself 
þan of anoþer. 
Þanne comyn possessions 
þat Socrates ordeyned 
for to voide strif scholde be more cause of strif þan pees. 
For, 
as we towchede tofore 
in þe seconde book, 
haue nouƷt in propre 
is þe lif of parfit men 
and fewe men ben parfit. 
And lawe þat scholde be Ʒeue to alle citeseyns 
and to alle þe puple schulde be suche 
by þe whiche men myƷte leue comynliche; 
and [in] Poletic[is] þe philosofer seith þat citeseyns scholde not be applied to lawes 
but lawes scholde be applied to citeseyns, 
for lawes and ordenaunce of citee scholde be accordyng 
to al þe puple 
and to þe comyn lyuynge. 
And so is not þe ordenaunce of Socrates, 
for it myƷt not be ikepte 
withoute greet stryf among men þat lyuen in comynte. 
And Ʒut þei possessions myƷte be comyn withoute strif, wifes and children 
myƷte not be comyne 
as Socrates wolde mene withoute strif. 
Þe seconde wey is declared in þis wise. 
For Ʒif alle thinges were comyne, 
it neded not to alle citesens trowe 
þat alle children ben here owne; 
but for som children scholde be liche 
to somme citeseyns 
and somme to oþere, 
eche citeseyn wolde take 
for his owne childe þe childe 
þat were leche to hym. 
Þerfore, ii Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer telleþ, 
as it is iseid in þe seconde book, 
among som nacions wyues ben comyne 
but þe citeseyns departen þe children by liknesse; 
for eche of hem taken 
for his owne children 
þe children þat ben ileche to hem. 
For so it fareþ among oþere bestes 
þat manye femeles bryngeþ | forþ brood liche to þe fadres – as þe philosofer telleþ, 
in þe lond of Salaria 
was a certeyn mare 
and alle wey here 
colt was liche to þe fader, 
and þerfore þe mare 
was icleped Iusta, riƷtful. 
Þanne þei wyues were comyne, 
Ʒut were not þat profit 
þat Socrates trowede þat citeseyns scholde trow þat alle children were here owne. 
Þe þridde wey is declared in þis wise. 
For þey wyues were comyne, 
scholde not be so greet loue 
in a citee as Socrates wolde mene, 
for of litel kynrade 
þat is certeyne 
and iknowe comeþ 
more loue þan of gret kynrade 
þat is in doute and vnknowe. 
For þeyƷ þe fader and sone be nere sibbe þanne þe eme, 
Ʒif þei knewe 
þat a child is his neuew, 
wolde loue hym bettre þan þe fader wolde loue þe sone 
Ʒif he were skylfulliche in doute 
wheþer he were his sone oþer no. 
And now is more doute 
in a citee 
as þe philosofer seith, 
ii Poleticorum, 
þat oon loueþ anoþer as his sone, 
anoþer an noþer 
as his broþer, 
anoþer anoþer as his nevew, anoþer as his emes sone 
and anoþer 
as his kynnes man, 
and so is more loue þanne is þe loue 
þat Socrates setteþ. 
For of litel kynrade 
þat is certeyn 
and iknowe comeþ more loue þan of þe kynrade 
þat is bytwene fader and sone Ʒif it is in doute and vnknowe 
as þe philosofer meneþ, 
þanne þe comynte þat Socrates setteþ 
is not spedful to a cite. 
Þanne kynges and princes scholde besyliche take hede to konne so ordeyne a cytee 
as it is spedful to þe comynte of citeseyns. Chapter X Secundo Polleticorum, 
þe philosofer preueþ 
þat manye harmes scholde sewe in | 
a citee Ʒif wyfes 
and children were comyne. 
And as it longeþ to þis doynge 
we may rekene fyue harmes 
þat þe philosofer toucheþ 
þere 
þat scholde come of suche comynte. 
Þe firste harme 
is wrong of kynnes men; 
þe seconde, despisyng of gentel men; 
þe þridde, forgendryng of children; 
þe ferþe, intemporamesse of lecherie; 
þe fifte, mysvsynge of fader and moder in lecherie. 
Þe firste is declared in þis wise. 
For in a cytee mot arise strif and wondes 
and despisynge and þe nere sibbe þe persone is þat is in strif, wounded and despised, 
þe worse ben þe strif, 
wondes and despisyng. 
Þanne for goodnesse and honeste of maneres 
it is spedful to a cite 
þat faders and moders 
be certeyn of here owne children 
and þat alle men ben certeyn of here owne cosynes and kynnes men 
leste þer falle stryf 
and wrong and dispisynge 
by vnknowynge bytwene children 
and fader and moder, 
cosyns and kynnes men. 
Wherfore by cause þat þe comynte of wymmen 
þat Socrates ordeyned bynemeþ certeynetee of children 
and knowyng of kynnes men, 
it is not to preisyng; 
for þerof it folweþ 
þat by vnknowyng som men myƷte sone doun wrong 
to here owne cosyns and kynnes men. 
Þe seconde harme is declared in þis wise. 
For Ʒif wifes and children were comyn, 
gentel men scholde be despised 
and plowƷ men and foule persones 
scholde be worschepped. 
For wyues and children 
myƷte not be comyne 
but children of gentil men and wardeynes of citees and of plowƷ men 
and foule persones 
hadde þe same kepynge. 
Wherfore children of gentil men 
scholde be despised 
and children of foule persones iworscheped. 
Þanne | were no frendschipe among citeseyns, for [in] Ethic [is] 
þe philosofer seith 
þat euene proporcioun [‡ destroyeþ] frendschepe. 
Þanne for good men and worthi ben 
aboue foule men and vnworthi, 
bytwene hem [is] frendschipe 
whan eche hath hemself 
in proporcioun 
after his owne staat 
as whanne vnnoble men 
seruen noble men 
and noble men quyten hem 
by proporcioun of here seruyce. 
Þanne it is al oon to desire 
þat children of citeseyns be comyne, 
and haue liche good kepyng 
and charge of children of noble men and of vnnoble men; 
and to despise noble men 
and to worschepe vnnoble men 
and not saue frendschipe among hem al is oon. 20 25 f.123v 30 35 Þe þridde harm is declared in þis wise. 
For of suche comyntee comeþ 
forgendryng of children. 
For, viii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat noon is frend to manye in parfit frendschipe noþer louen manye persones passyngliche, 
for passyng loue 
is more sette in oon þanne in manye. 
Þerfore in þe same book 
þe philosofer concludeþ 
þat it is not ethe passyngliche 
to plese manye. 
Wherfore Ʒif eche citeseyn trowede 
þat alle children 
were his owne, 
his loue were ilost; 
for among so manye he scholde louye ech but litel and recche ful litel of eche. 
Also no citeseyn 
but he were a fool myƷte trowe 
þat alle þe children were his owne. 
Þanne Ʒif he louede alle children 
as his owne, 
þat were by cause of tweyne oþer 
þre þat he trowede 
þat were his owne. 
And for thilke ben not certeynliche iknowe to hym, 
Socrates trowede þat he wolde loue 
alle þe oþere 
by cause of hem. 
But as þe philosofer argeweþ, 
ii [Polet]icorum, 
it is al oon to desyre to louye 
a gret multitude of children 
as his owne children 
by cause of tweyne oþere of | fewe children and to do a lytel hony in moche water. 
For as a litel hony myƷte not make al a ryuer swete, 
so loue of twey children 
oþer of þre myƷte not make endeles manye children 
in a cite plesynge and hertilich iloued. 
But Ʒif citeseyns louede not children, 
þanne children scholde not be wel 
ikept noþer with besinesse. 
Þe ferþe harme is declared in þis wise. 
For þe vertue of generacioun 
is [‡lcorrupte and so þe appetite 
haþ neuere inow and þeig a man haue but on wif, 
it is ful hard for hym bere hym wel and temporatliche to þat oon. 
Þanne as whanne glotonye is excited 
by multitude of metes 
it is hard to be abstinent, 
so whanne lecherie is excited 
by multitude of wymmen 
it is hard 
and as it were inposcible 
to be temporate. 
Þe fifþe harm may be declared in þis wise. 
For Ʒif fadres and mod- ers knowen not here owne, 
sones and douƷtres liƷtliche 
may be mysvsynge in lecherie 
with fader and moder and cosyns 
so þat þe sones wolde take þe moders 
and þe faders þe douƷters. 
But Socrates wolde voyde þis inconuenient 
and seide þat it longeþ to þe rector of þe citee to haue charge and besynesse 
þat þe sones do no lecherie 
by þe moders 
noþer þe faders by þe douƷtres. 
But as þe philosofer seith, 
þis [is] not inow; 
for Ʒif sones and douƷtres were comyne and knewe not here owne fadres and moders, 
þei þe sone were forbode to do 
þe dede of lecherie 
with his moder and fater wiþ his douƷter, 
Ʒut is not loue of lust of likynge of lecherie 
for þat kynrade 
is not schewed to hem. 
Þanne for betwene so 
nyg sibbe persones not onliche þe dede of lech- erie is euel and detestable 
but also lust and likynge is horrible, 
Socrates his opynyoun 
was to blame of comynte of wifes | and of children. 
Þanne kynges and princes scholde so ordeyne a citee and forbede comynte of wifes and of children 
for fadres and modres scholde be certeyne 
of here owne children. Chapter XI Secundo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat alle thinges 
to be comyn 
may be vnderstonde in þre manere wise. 
For in thinges þat seruen to liflode tweyne mot be knowe: 
þinges þat beren fruyt as feldes, vynƷerdes, and treen, 
and fruyt þat comeþ 
þerof as wyn, corn and apples. 
Þanne Ʒif suche thinges 
ben comyn to citesens, 
þynges þat beren fruyt ben comyne 
and fruyt is gadred in comyne. 
And so it was in olde tyme among certeyne nacions, 
as þe philosofer reherseth, 
oþer ei[þe]re is comyne, 
þynges þat bereþ fruit 
and þe fruit þerof, 
as Socrates ordeyn- ede. 
For as it is iseid tofore, 
he wolde mene þat Ʒif no thing were propre in a citee, 
noþer possessioun noþer fruyt noþer children noþer wyues, 
no stryf scholde arise in þe citee. 
And þe philosofer seith at þe first siƷt þis ordinaunce of Socrates 
semeþ ful spedful to a citee; 
for whanne a man hireth 
þat a cite is so iordeyned 
in þe whiche is so greet comynte of citeseyns, 
þey wenen þat þe cite is in welthe 
and in felicite and troweþ 
þat þe citeseyns louen eche other atte beste and leuen withoute strif 
for among hem 
is so greet comynte ikepte. 
But as it is iseid, 
ii Poleticorum, 
in particuler doynge it nedeþ 
to vse experience and assay, 
we hauen iseid þat 
[m]e þat hauen thinges in comyne hauen more stryf among hemsilf þan Ʒif eche hadde his owne in propre possessioun. 
And by þre weyes we may preue þat Ʒif alle þynges were comyne to citeseyns, 
more strif | scholde rise in þe cite þan þer scholde Ʒif eche hadde his owne proper possessioun. 
Þe firste wey is itake by comyn possessioun; 
þe seconde, 
by parteners of suche thinges; 
þe þridde, 
by vneuenesse of 
citeseyns.10 Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For whanne a thing is comyne to diuerse men, 
Ʒif oon is ilette 
by anoþer of vse and [f]rute of þat comyne thing, 
þanne þere ariseþ strif and discord bytwene hem. 
For we seen þat breþerne of on wombe hauen greet strif and plee for comyne heritage 
þat þei hauen Ʒif þe oon vseþ not þat heritage 
as it semeþ to þe oþer 
þat it is spedful. 
Þanne Ʒif breþerne of o wombe 
þat ben fewe and trowen sikerliche 
þat þei be so nyƷ sibbe hauen gret strif for comyn heritage, 
moche more among alle citeseyns 
Ʒif alle thinges were comyn to hem 
gret strif scholde arise for þei ben manye 
and of diuers wille and beþ not so nyƷ sibbe 
as breþeren of on wombe. 
For if it were as Socrates seide 
þat alle citeseyns 
for comynte of wymmen 
and of wifes wolde trowe 
þat he nyƷ were sibbe, 
Ʒit þeiƷ he were so nyƷ sibbe in dede 
as breþeren of oon wombe, 
Ʒit þat sibrade myƷte not be certeynliche iknowe 
as it is ipreued tofore. 
Þanne Ʒif certeyn sibrade benemeþ notstrif 
bytwene fewe men 
þat hauencomyn heritage, 
moche more vncerteyne sibrade 
miƷte not byneme strif among alle citeseyns. 
Þe seconde wey to preue þe same is itake by partyners in comyn heritage. 
For þe more men hauen in comyn, 
þe more þei mote be ifere. 
But men mow not be swithe longe ifere but strif aryse bytwene hem. 
By partyners in comyne heritage, 
| for þei motbe moche ifere comynlich, 
among hem mot be strif and plee. 
Þerfore, ii Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat we ben ofte igreued with seruantes 
þat ben most nedful to vs 
and ben ful wrooth wiþ hem 
for we mote haue moche speche wiþ hem and comyne with hem longe tyme. 
Þanne Ʒif bytwene lordes and seruantes 
þat ben so sogette for longe comunicacioun and speche is greet strif, 
moche more [wolde arise greet strif] 
among citeseins of þe whiche noon wol be sogette to oþer. 
And þerfore among hem is greet stryf 
Ʒyf þei hadde comyn heritage; 
and Ʒif þei most comyne moche togedres, 
þan þere wolde arise greet stryf. f. 124v 40 
Þe þridde wey is itake 
by euenesse of citeseyns. 
For Ʒif heritage were comyne 
to al þe citeseyns, 
it were ful hard and presumptuous 
to gete so manye strangers 
þat myƷte telie so moche lond. 
Þerfore it is spedful 
to a citee 
to be so departed 
þat som citeseyns goo 
to þe plow 
and somme kepe þe citee, 
and Socrates graunteþ. 
Þanne for wardeyns of þe citee ben more noble þan plow men, 
as more noble and worthi þei wolde trowe 
þat þei scholde fonge more of fruyt and possessioun þanne plow men, 
þanne wolde strif arise among hem for plow men 
trauelen more aboute poss[ess]ioun 
and scholde lasse fonge of þe fruyt. 
Þanne for to take heede of brotelnesse of men and Ʒif it is bisiliche iknowe 
þat comynte of men goon out of þe riƷt wey and parfite for no strif scholde rise among citeseyns, 
it is spedful to a citee 
þat possessions 
be not comyn as Socrates seide. 
Ʒif þe manere of staat of men is iknowe, 
þe philosoferis wey is more spedful to a cite; 
for he seith þat possessions and þynges | 
of citeseyns scholde be propre and comyne – propre touching lordschipe and comyne 
for þe vertue of liberalite. 
For Ʒif þe condicioun of mankynde 
is besiliche iknowe, 
as men comynlich holden lawes 
and good ordinaunce, 
it is spedful to citeseyns 
to haue propre possessions 
touchynge þe lordschipe; 
for eche lord of his owne 
is besy aboute his owne. 
And it is spedful 
þat suche thinges 
be comyne by liberalite, 
for citeseyns scholde be liberal 
among hemself and Ʒeue of his owne good eche to oþer. 
And þerfore 
as it is iseide, 
ii Poleticorum, 
among Lacede- mones 
was so greet liberalite 
þat þei eche hadde his owne propre good, 
good touching þe lordschipe, 
Ʒit for liberalite touchinge þe vse were comyne to hem seruantes, 
hors and houndes; 
for eche citeseyn whanne hym nedede wiþoute eny oþer requisicioun vsede oþeres seruantes, 
hors and houndes. Chapter XII 
As it is iseid tofore, 
Socrates ordeynede þat wymmen scholde leme dedes of armes 
and fiƷte in bataille 
as men doþ and took þerto ensau[m]ple of bestes of þe whiche boþe maal and femel fiƷtten. 
But þat kynges and princes 
and alle þat scholde rewle a citee scholde not ordeyne wymen to dedes of armes, 
but men, 
it may be preued by þre weyes 
by þre þat nedeþ to fiƷte in bataille: 
for fiƷttynge men scholde be waar and wel avised in herte, 
myƷti and bold of herte, 
strong and stalworthe in body. 
For cautels and wisdom ben nedful in bataille 
for som tyme enemyes 
ben ouercome more 
by cautels and sleythe þan by strengþe. 
For fewe sleye fiƷttynge men 
and redy ouercomen manye not by strengþe but | 
by redinesse and wisdome. 
Panne for wymmen hauen feble counsaille and lacken vse of resoun 
and ben not sley 
and waar as men ben, 
þei scholde not be ordeyned 
to dedes of armes 
for in bataille 
and in fiƷtyng nedeþ greet cautel and sleiþe. 
For as [V]egesius, 
De Re Militari, 
seith þat oþere dedes 
þat ben mysdo mowe be putte 
of but happes of batailles 
ben wiþoute remedye, 
þanne by sleyþe 
þat nedeþ in fiƷtynge men we may argue 
þat wymmen scholde not leme dedes of armes. 
f. 125r 5 10 
Þe seconde wey to preue þe same is itake 
by strengþe and boldnesse 
þat nedeþ in fiƷtynge men. 
For as it is iseid, 
iii Eticorum, 
þe ende of al dredful þynges ‡ is deþ, 
and to dedes of armes neden bolde men and hardy, 
for fiƷtynge men putten hemself 
to peril of deþe, 
and comynliche wymmen 
ben ferful and feble, 
and þat is boþe 
for frelenesse of þe body 
and for coldenesse of complexioun – 
for as it is iseid 
tofore coold makeþ alwey to fere and to drede, 
for coold constreynen and wiþdrawen, 
and he þat is bold and hardy putteþ hemself to hiƷ doynge and heete makeþ 
a man strong and hardy, 
and coold makeþ 
a man fereful and coward – 
wherfore wymmen 
þat ben ferful and coward 
scholde not be ordeyned to dedes of armes. 
For betere it is in bataille 
to putte awey ferful men 
þanne to haue hem in companye. 
Þerfore for it is kyndelich for man to drede deeþ, 
stronge men and bolde dreden 
whanne þei seen ferful men drede. 
Þanne leste fiƷtynge men be maad cowardes and ferful, 
wymmen scholde not vse dedes of armes. 
Þe þridde wey is itake by bodiliche strengþe. 
For fiƷtynge men mote longe 
suf|fre and Ʒeue grete strokes 
and bere also heuy armer, 
þerfore it is spedful 
þat þei haue stronge scholdres 
and lendes to bere heuy armere 
and stronge armes 
to Ʒeue stronge strokes. 
Þanne for wymmen hauen nesch flesche 
and lacken bodilich strengþe, 
þei scholde not be ordeyned 
to dedes of armes. 
And þe resoun 
þat meueþ Socrates 
so for to mene, 
þat is itake of liknesse of bestes, 
is not suffisaunt; 
for as þe philosofer seith, 
ii Poleticorum, 
bestes vsen noon housbondrye noþer resoun; 
and by good housbondrie 
and dispensacioun men 
mote ordeyne hous and citee. 
Wherfore in thinges þat bestes doun withoute resoun 
we schal not folwe hem. Chapter XIII Socrates seide þat alwey 
þe same men scholde be princes 
in a cytee, 
and he spake of principate 
as it is itake for eche lordschipe oþer for eche maistrie 
oþer for eche greet office. 
And by þre weyes we may preue 
þat it is not spedful 
to a citee 
þat þe same men be alwey 
in þe same greet office. 
Þe firste wey is itake 
by a kyng oþer 
by eche oþer 
þat schal Ʒeue suche office and dignyte; 
þe seconde is itake by þe officers; 
and þe þridde, 
by þe citeseyns. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For as it is iseide, 
v Ethicorum, 
principate scheweth what a man is, 
for a[r] men ben itake to dignite 
þei ben not so 
iknowe wheþer 
þei ben good or euel 
as þei ben afterward. 
For a pryuat persone 
þat haþ no maystrie 
may not be so iknowe as a comyn persone 
þat haþ myƷt and maystrie. 
For not so manye iƷene takeþ hede 
to a priuate persone 
þat haþ no maystrie 
as doþ 
to a comyne persone 
þat haþ maystrie, 
a man is not so iknowe | 
while he is a priuat persone and haþ no maystrie 
as he is afterward 
iknowe whanne he is in office 
and haþ maistrie. 
Þanne a kyng and eche man 
þat schal Ʒeue an office and sette officers 
þerinne scholde take hede 
and knowe what men he makeþ officers. 
Ʒif principat and maystrie 
and eche greet office 
scheweth what þat a man is, 
it is spedful 
þat he [þat] Ʒeue office and maystrie 
ouer citeseyns assaye first 
and knowe what men he makeþ officers and maystris. 
And after experience and assaye, 
he scholde graunte hem here office 
oþer take hem to grettere office 
as it semeþ 
þat it is to doynge. 5 10 f. 125v 15 
Þe seconde wey to preue þe same is itake by officers. 
For officers of citees wolde do moche harme Ʒif þei knewe 
þat þei were perpetual in here office, 
and wolde spare to do suche harme 
Ʒif þei knewe 
þat þei scholde out of office. 
Þe þridde wey is itake by citeseyns 
þat ben vnder suche officers. 
For as a leche takeþ 
no counsaille of heele 
but hele is his entent as þe ende, 
so he þat ordeyneþ 
a cite schal not axe counsaille of pees 
and of acord of citeseyns. 
For as it is iseid, 
ii[i] Ethicorum, 
counsaille i[s] not of þe ende 
but of menes to come to þe ende, 
and pees and acord scholde be þ’entent of þe reulere 
of a citee as þe ende. 
Þanne a citee scholde be soo desposed 
þat pees 
may be kepte þerinne 
and no tresoun arise þerinne. 
And som tyme chaungynge of officers and Ʒeuyng of maystrees and principates 
to diuerse persones helpen to make þe staat of cite- seyns in pees 
and quiete as þe philosofer meneþ, ii Poleticorum. 
For Ʒif oþere were forsake and alwey þe same men [were isette] 
in greet office, 
oþer, seynge hemself | despised, 
wolde conspire and rise 
and disturble þe citee. 
Secundo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer toucheþ 
þis þridde resoun 
þat dispreuen þe ordinaunce of Socrates. 
For he seith þat Socrates 
wolde alwey haue þe same princes and officers, 
and þat is cause of rysyng 
and of tresoun among hem 
þat hauen no dignite. 
For seyng þat þei haue non dignite, 
Ʒif þei ben bold and hardi, 
þei drawen togedres 
and risen 
and maken greet discord and strif. Chapter XIV For we trowen 
þat philosofres tretynge of policies 
and of ordenance of citeseyns speke not wiþoute resoun, 
þerfore it is wel idoo to trete here 
opynyons not for boost 
but for it is nedful to þe lore 
and wey 
þat we schal teche of rewelyng of citee and of regne. 
And for it is iknowe what philosofer wolde mene in þat mater and Ʒif here 
opynyons ben itreted, 
it wolde be þe more clerliche iknowe 
what is best menyng 
in suche matier of rewelynge. 
Þanne for it is declared tofore þat it is not spedful to a cite þat possessions, 
wyues and children be comyne, 
as Socrates wolde mene, 
noþer it is semelich 
þat wymmen be ordeyned 
to dedes of armes, 
noþer it is good 
þat alwey þe same officers 
be in þe same office 
as Socrates ordeyned, 
þanne it is to tretyng of deuysioun 
and delynge 
þat Socrates ordeynede 
of a cite 
and of ordenaunce þerof. 
For Socrates seide 
as it is iseide tofore þat in a citee scholde 
be fyue parties – prince, counsaillers, fightyng men, craftes men and plowƷ men – 
for he wolde 
þat fiƷttynge men scholde be a partye of þe citee distynguede 
fro oþere citeseyns. 
And he ordeinede nombre and tale of fiƷtynge men 
and seide þat in eche citee scholde 
be fif þousant at þe most, 
a mille at þe leste. 
And | þis ordenance of fyghtyng men 
may be despreued in þre manere wise 
by þre manere doynge 
þat Socrates seide of fightynge men. 
For firste he seide þat a scholde be distingwed 
fram oþere citeseins; 
þe seconde, 
he ordeynede a greet multitude of fiƷtynge men; 
þe þridde, 
he ordeyned hem 
in a certeyne nombre and tale. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wyse. 
For alwey comyne profit scholde be sette to[fore] 
a singuler profit, 
and it is kyndelich 
þat a partie put itself 
to peril 
for alle þe body, 
þanne aƷenst þe ordre of kynde eche citeseyn doþ Ʒif he putte not hymself 
to peril 
for þe defence of þe contreye. 
Þanne fiƷtynge men scholde not so alwey be departed 
so fro Cristene men 
and oþere citeseyns 
so 
þat oþere citeseyns neden not to fiƷtee for þe contreye. 
Þanne it is bettre to seye 
þat in a citee ben 
as manye fightynge men 
and defendours of þe contreye 
as þerinne ben citeseyns 
þat may bere armere. 
And so it is bettere 
þan departe fight- ynge fram oþere citeseyns. 
Þe seconde wey is declared in þis wise. 
For [to] ordeyne so manye fiƷtynge men 
as in eche citee fyue þousand or a þousand, 
it were ful hard and greet charge 
to þe citeseyns 
of oon citee to susteyne 
by comyne wages a þousand men of þe whiche non haþ office 
noþer can do 
but fiƷte whan it is tyme. 
And it were more charge 
and as it were more 
þan citeseyns 
myƷte bere to susteyne 
fyue þousand in þat wise, for þat citee most haue possessions 
as it were at wille 
þat it myƷte by comyn cost susteyne so many men. 
Þerfore, ii Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer blameþ Socrates | 
for suche ordinaunce of cite and seith 
þat þe citee so iordeyned moste be 
in þe regne of Babilonia, 
on caas forgreet desert and wildemesse 
þer is pase of londes 
þat myƷte fede manye men. 
For as þe philosofer meneþ, 
it were more hard to citeseyns 
to fede hemself, semantes, and children 
and so manye fiƷttyng men ouer. 
Þeþridde, Socrates trespacede ordeynynge a cite 
and settynge certeyn nombre and tale of fiƷtynge men; 
for as þe philosofer seith, ii Poleticomm, 
he þat wol sette lawes 
oþer make eny ordenaunce 
in a cite scholde take hede to þre: 
to þe men, 
to þe contreye, 
and to place þat ben nyƷ aboute. 
Þanne Ʒif a man wolle ordeyne fyƷtynge men 
oþere þanne citeseyns leuynge by comune 
fmyt of þe citee, 
he scholde take hede to þre. Firste, 
to þe citeseyns; 
for Ʒif þe citeseyns 
were cowardes not able to fiƷte, 
þanne nedede moo fiƷtynge men of suche. 
Þe seconde, 
he scholde take hede 
to þe contray and londes; 
[for þe moo contray and londes] 
a citee haþ, 
þe moo fiƷtynge men 
þa[t] he may susteyne. 
Þe þridde, 
he scholde take hede to place 
þat ben nyƷ aboute wheþer þat cite haue nyƷ aboute frendes oþer enemyes, 
cowardes oþer manlich men; 
for by diuerse condicions of som men 
it nedeþ to ordeyne diuerseliche of þe nombre of fiƷtyng men. 
Þanne for art and science 
may not be of particuler thinges asigned, 
he þat wol teche art of rewelyng of citees 
may not ordeyne certeyn nombre of fiƷtynge men; 
but suche doynges moot stonde on þe doom of a wise rector and rewelere takynge heede of condicions of citeseyns, 
of manere of þe contrey, 
and circumstance | of men 
þat ben nyƷ aboute. Chapter XV 
It was iseide tofore 
þat Socrates and his disciple Plato seide þat a citee scholde be so ireweled and gouerned 
þat citeseyns scholde haue comyne wifes, children and possessiouns. 
And þat may not stonde 
3¿f it is vnderstonde 
as þe wordis stondeþ 
as it is declared tofore. 
Nathalees for Plato 
and his disciples 
þat were icleped Platonici 
and hadde a manere spekynge by liknesse, 
and oon caas Socrates vsede þat manere spekynge while Plato was his disciple, 
Ʒif we wollen vnderstonde Socrates speche not as þe wordes soneþ, 
we may saue [h]is ‡ posicioun. 
For it is not possible noþer profitable 
þat alle þynges be verreyliche comyn to citeseyns, 
but by loue comynte scholde be saued þerinne. 
For as eche citeseyn 
scholde loue oþer citeseyns as hymself, 
so þey scholde loue here wyues, 
children and possessioun 
as his owne. 
Þanne in þis wise alle thinges scholde be comyne to citeseyns 
so þat eche scholde loue þe comyne profit 
and þe profit of alle 
and be besy for possessions of oþere citeseyns whanne it is tyme 
as þei it were his owne. 
In wyues and children comynte schal be saued and kepte by loue 
but in possessions comynte scholde be kepte not onlich by loue so 
þat al citeseyns scholde loue comynliche þe profit of eche citeseyn, 
but also by perteynynge 
and by liberalite. 
For eche citeseyn scholde departe and loue Ʒeue of good 
to oþere citeseyns 
as resoun axeþ. 
Þanne as we sauen Socrates speche toching comyntees of citeseyns, 
so we may saue his speche touchinge vnite of a cite. 
For whanne he seide þat most vnite scholde be in a citee, 
| on caas he vnderstood not of vnite of habitacioun and wonynge place 
so þat alle citeseyns scholde wonye in oon hous, 
so þat in a citee scholde not be ‡ manye hous 
noþer manye stretes; 
noþer of vnite of craftes men, 
so þat in a citee scholde not by diuerse craftes and diuerse craftes men; 
noþer of vnyte of þynges 
þat neden to suffisant leuynge, 
so þat in a citee scholde not be manye and diuerse þynges 
þat nedeþ to þe lyf. 
But on caas þei menede of vnyte of loue and frendschipe 
so þat a citee were best Ʒif citeseyns 
were most oned and acorded 
in loue and frendschipe. 
Panne for Socrates menynge is declared of comynte of thinges 
and of vnyte of citeseyns, 
it is soþ 
þat he trowede þat in a cite scholde be most pees 
and þat no stryf scholde rise þerinne, 
for propre desire of loue semeþ pees and acoo[r]d. 
And þat Socrates seide þat wymmen scholde be ordeyned 
to dedes of armes 
it may be saued; 
for Ʒif men were out of þe citee fiƷtyng 
in þe feeld and enemyes ful on þe citee 
in þe mene tyme, þanne for defaute of men 
wymen most defende þe citee. 
And þat he seith þat alwey þe same officers 
scholde be in office 
so þat alwey þe same scholde be meyre, 
bayllees and officers, 
on caas it scholde be so vnderstonde so 
þat alwey þe same manere vertues men scholde be in gret office. 
And for he deuydede and delede 
þe cite in craftes men, 
plow men and fiƷtynge men, 
he vnderstood by fiƷtynge men gentel men 
and noble þat scholde not worche with here hondes. 
In a citee som men worchen wiþ | here hondes ‡ 
as plow men and craftes men; 
and somme worchen not wiþ here hondes as gentel men and noble, 
and þei scholde principaliche defende þe contre and principaliche vse sleyþe of armes. 
For Socrates wolde mene þat no polici 
and comynte scholde be cleped a citee 
but þerinne were 
atte leste a þousand gentil men and noble, 
and he clepede hem fiƷtynge men 
by manere excellent doynge. 25 f. 127r 30 Chapter XVI 
Alle wiþoute Socrates and Plato 
oon oþer þat heet Felleas 
as þe philosofer telleþ, 
ii Poleticorum, 
entermete of ordenaunce of citees 
and ordeyned how policy myƷt best be iordeyned, 
and seide þat among oþere 
þat þe Ʒeuere of þe lawe 
and rector of polecie scholde knowe Oon 
is how citeseyns scholde haue ileche moche possessioun; 
for he wolde mene þat a cite 
is best iordeyned 
Ʒif no citesen 
hath more rente noþer possessioun þanne anoþer, 
and seith þat it myƷt be esiliche idoo 
in þe bygynnynge 
whanne a citee is imaad. 
For Ʒif þe nombre of citeseyns is iknow 
and þe multitude of feldes acounted sone, 
þe rector of þe citee 
may dele þe possessions euene among þe citeseyns. 
But whanne þe cite is imaad and citeseyns hauen possessions not al ileche moche, 
it is hard for to bryng hem to haue al ileche moche. 
But Felleas ordeyned 
þat þe rector 
of a citee schulde brynge hem 
þerto in þis wise 
by dowynge and ordeynede 
þat þe pore scholde be wedded to þe riche 
and fonge dowynge of riche 
in contracte and Ʒeue noon to þe riche. 
Þanne þe | pore fongyng greet dowyng of þe riche 
may be as riche as he. 
And Felleas myƷte by þre resons be meued to suche ordeynyng: first, 
he myƷte be meued 
þerto for strif scholde ceese; þe seconde, 
for to putte of wrong and discord; 
þe þridde, 
by þynges 
þat he sey in oþere polices. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For citeseyns stryuen faste 
for possessions and coueyten comynliche to moche to haue rente and possessioun 
and þerof comeþ 
gret strif, wherfore, 
Ʒif citeseyns 
hadde alle ileche moche possessioun 
and knewe þat no citeseyn myƷte passe oþer in possessioun, 
it were an idel for to strive 
and plede þerfore. 
For Ʒif oon þat pledeþ rekeuereþ of þe oþer, 
he schal not þerby take greet profit; 
for by þe condicioun of doynge he mot be euene wiþ oþere citeseyns in possessioun. 
Also he þat leseþ 
þe plee schal not moche lese, 
for fongynge dowynge he schal be maad peere 
wiþ þe oþere in richesse. 
Þanne it semeþ 
þat al strif and plee scholde ceese Ʒif citeseyns 
were alle ileche riche. 
Þe seconde wey is itake to putte of wrong 
and discord in þe citee. 
For by cause þat citeseyns 
wolde gladliche haue propre possessions 
and saye “þis is 
myne,” not oonliche stryf 
and plee ariseþ 
but also wronges, discord and dispisynge 
for to gete possessions, 
for þerfore citeseyns don eche oþer wrong and despisen persones. 
Also in a citee is þefte, 
robberie and manslauƷt for coueytise of possessioun; 
and [þanne Ʒif citeseyns 
may not passe hem in possessions, 
and haueth ileche moche 
riches,] it semeþ þat al þis scholde ceese. 
Þe þridde wey is itake by thinges 
þat þei | seie in oþere citeseyns. 
For in manye policies 
wel iordeyned Ʒeuers of þe lawe hadde greet charge of possessions of citeseyns, 
on caas þerfore Felleas 
was imeued by thinges 
þat he seie in oþere policees, 
þat is wisdomes, 
and ordeyned to haue greet charge of possessions of citeseyns, 
willyng þat possessions scholde bee euene 
and alle citeseyns haue ileche moche possession. f. 127v 35 Chapter XVII [Ʒif þe] speche of þe philosofer, 
ii Poleticorum, 
‡ is iknowe touching þis doyng, 
by þre weyes we may preue 
þat it nedeþ not 
þat citeseyns haue 
alle ileche moche possessioun 
as Felles ordeyned. 
Þe firste is itake 
by gendryng of children; 
þe seconde, 
by wrong þat myƷte aryse in þe citee; 
þe þridde, 
by vertues þat citeseyns scholde haue. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For to riƷtful rewelyng 
of a cite may no lawe be Ʒeue 
þat citeseyns scholde haue 
alle ileche moche possessioun 
but it were iordeyned 
þat þei scholde haue 
alle ileche manye children; 
for it is folie to geue a lawe 
þat may not be holde. 
For, iiii Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat it is not onliche to chargynge 
what lawes ben ygeue 
but also þat men ben obedient to þe lawes. 
Þanne Ʒif alle citeseyns hauen 
alle ileche moche possessions 
and oon haþ moo children 
þan anoþer, 
whanne þe fader heritage 
is ideled among children 
þanne failleþ Felleas <is> lawe for not alle citeseyns hauen ileche moche possessioun. Þanne for in þe moo parties 
a þyng is departed 
þe lasse is eche partiners deel þerof, 
it may not be þat alwey citeseyns haue ileche moche possessioun 
but eche citeseyn haue 
as manye children as anoþer. 
But for som mariage is al 
barey|ne and som hath mo children þanne anoþer, 
it is not poscible to ordeyne in a citee 
þat alle citeseyns haue ileche manye children. 
Wherfore by gendryng of children 
it is clerliche declared 
þat þe forseyde lawe 
is not skilful, 
for it may not be skilliche iholde. 
Þe seconde wey is itake by wronges 
þat myƷte arise in þe citee of þe whiche wronges 
he þat Ʒeueþ þe lawe scholde be most besiliche waar. 
For it longeþ to þe prince to haue charge 
þat citeseynes be not mys- farynge 
and þat noon do oþer wrong. 
But Ʒif it is iordeyned 
in a citee 
þat þe pore be euene wiþ riche men 
in possessioun fongynge 
gret doynge of hem 
and Ʒeuynge to hem riƷt noon, 
it happeþ ofte þat riche men 
ben imaad poore and pore men riche. 
For Ʒif sum riche men 
haue tmo] children þanne pore men, 
here possessions mot be deled in mo partees þanne possessions of pore men. 
And so riche men children schal be more pore 
þanne pore men children, 
and herof comeþ wrong 
in þe citee 
in twey manere wise. 
First, 
for pore men cunne not bere fortune 
whanne þei ben riche 
as þe philosofer declareth playnliche, 
ii Rethorycorum, 
þanne he wolle do oþere men wrong. 
For pore men children ben proute 
whanne þei ben more riche 
þan oþere and don oþere wrong, 
and so wrong riseþ in þe citee. 
Also suche wrong 
and despisynge scholde rise among citeseyns 
not onliche 
by pore mennes children 
but also | by reche men children. 
For as it is iseid, ii Poleticorum, 
it is nedful to pees of a citee 
þat riche men children 
be not mysfarynge and outrages. 
Þanne for comynliche riche men children 
louen worschep 
and ben greet herted, 
Ʒif þei seen hemself dispised 
and pore men iworscheped, 
þei mowe not forbere 
but be mysfarynge and outrages 
and do oþer men wrong. 20 25 30 35 f.128r 40 
Þe þridde wey to declare 
þat Felleas his lawe of euene possessioun 
is not skilful it is itake by vertues 
þat citeseyns schuld haue, 
for citeseyns schulde be liberal and temporat. 
Þan it is not wel iseid 
that to þe rewling of a cite it is inow þat citeseyns haue euene possessions 
but þe quantite of possessions 
were in som wise isette in certeyne. 
For citeseyns myƷt haue so litel possessioun 
þat þei most lyue so scarseliche 
þat þei miƷte not wel do dedes of liberalite. 
Also Ʒif possessions were euene ideled among citeseyns, 
þei myƷte haue so moche possessioun 
and lyue so likyngliche 
þat þei scholde be not temperate. Chapter XVIII Kynges and princes 
and alle þat schuld Ʒyue lawe schuld Ʒeue som lawe of som possessions of citeseyns. 
For Salmon þat was iholde wis and redi in Ʒeuyng of lawe Ʒaf manye lawes of possessions of citeseyns. 
Also among þe men 
þat ben icleped Locres 
as þe philosofer seith, ii Poleticorum, 
it was þe lawe 
þat for to kepe 
and saue þe olde stokkes of heritage 
al hool no man scholde selle possessions 
but he myƷte preue atte folle þat som gret myshappe hym were byfalle. 
And manye thinges ben iordeyned in lawe of possessions, 
but it is not spedful to ordeyne by lawe þat citeseyns miƷte | haue al ileche moche possession. And hisentent þat Ʒeueþ þe lawe schuldenot princi- palich be of possession, 
but his entent schulde principalliche 
be to abate coueitise – for outward possessions 
is not þe rote of malice 
but coueitise is þe rote of euel and malice. 
Þan Ʒif þei schulde recche and charge þe rote and cause more 
þan oþere þynges, rectoris of citeseyns schul charge more to abate coueitise 
þa[n] oþer þynges 
as þe philosofer preueþ, ii Poleticorum. 
But here of we schul speke more largeliche herafter. 
But we ben avised þat we made a tretes of diuersete of ethic, rethorik, and of politik. And thinges 
þat ben iseid 
þer semen atte firste siƷt contrarie to thinges 
þat we hauen now iseid, 
but inneremore þat contrariete schal be put of. 
And now it is inow to knowe 
þat his principal entent 
þat Ʒeueþ lawe scholde not be 
on mesure of outward possessioun, 
and þat we may preue 
by þre weyes: 
þe firste is itake by werschep 
þat men disiren, 
þe seconde by likynge 
þat men folwen, 
þe þridde by sorwe 
þat men schonyen and forsaken. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wyse. 
For Felleas trowede þat al stryf 
of a citee is for possessioun and lordschipe of outward thinges. 
But he was deceyued 
in suche trowyng; 
for þeiƷ pore men 
for þei hauen grete nede to outward good 
stryuen comynliche and pleden for outward good, 
nathalees worschepful persones and gracious 
ben more destourbled 
and hauen more indignacioun 
yf þei mow not haue 
þewe werschep 
as þei ben worthi. 
Þanne for somme citeseyns ben pore persones 
and somme ben worschepful and gracious, 
þe Ʒeuere of lawes scholde not onliche ordeyne 
þat possessiouns be | wel iordeyned 
but also þat worschep be semelich and riƷtfullyche ideled. 
And þe more principaliche þei scholde take heede þat wirschepe be riƷtfulliche ideled in so moche as strif and plee 
bytwene worschepful persones 
is worse and more perelous 
þanne bytweyn oþere persones. 
Þe seconde wey to preue þe same is itake by likynge 
þat men folwen comynliche. 
For not onliche men don wronge 
for owtward good and coueitise, 
but also þei doun wrong in douƷtres and wyues of citeseyns 
for likyng and intemporatnesse. 
Þanne kynges and prynces 
scholde not make lawe oonliche for mesure of possessioun 
so þat eche man haue his owne, 
but he scholde also make manye ordenaunces to abate passions 
so þat citeseyns be not intemporate noþer do wrong 
in wyues and douƷtres of oþere men. 
And þe more luf wyues and douƷtres ben passynge 
oþer outward good, 
þe more besy kynges 
and princes scholde be in þat doynge. 
Þe þridde wey is itake by sorwe 
þat men wolde voide with al here myƷt. 
For men wolde haue ioye 
and likynge withoute sorwe 
and don þerfore wrong 
to oþere men 
not onlich to haue þynges 
þat nedeþ to putte of hunger oþer cold, 
but also for he troweþ 
þat oþere men may lette here likynge oþer 
for he troweth 
þat oþere men may do hem sorwe. 
Þanne not onliche for possessions 
lawe scholde be maad as Felleas seide 
but also for oþere doynge 
as it is declared 
tofore atte folle. Chapter XIX 
Alle wiþoute Socrates and Felleas 
was anoþer philosofer 
þat heet Ipodomus 
þat entremetede of rewelyng of citees 
and made many ordenaunces perteynyng 
to rewelyng of citeseyns. 
And it semeþ 
þat his ordinaunce touching suche rewelyng ben conteyned in sexe. 
For first, 
he made manye ordenaunces perteynynge 
to multitude and distinccioun of citeseyns; 
þe seconde, 
he termyned of distinciouns of possessions; 
þe þridde, 
of distinccions of auditours; 
þe ferþe, 
of distincciouns of iuges; 
þe fifþe, 
of þe manere of demyng; 
þe sexte and laste, 
he made certeyne lawes touchinge diuerse persones. 
And Ipodomus makyng his polici, 
a‡ entermeted first of multitude 
and distinccioun of citeseyns, 
and seide þat þe best multitude 
and quantite of citeseyns 
is as it were þe nombre of x þousand men. 
And he distingwed þis multitude 
in þre partees – in fiƷtynge men, craftes men, 
and lond tyliers. 
And he wolde þat fiƷtynge men 
scholde haue armere and no lond, 
and erþe tilers scholde haue lond and non armer, and craftes men no lond noþer armer. 
As it longeþ to þis doyng, 
it semeþ þat man nedeþ þre: 
mete and drynke for kynde 
hete þat wasteþ 
þe moysture 
þat hatte humidum radicale. 
Þe seconde, 
man nedeþ clothyng 
and oþere thinges 
imaad by craft 
for distemperyng of þe ayere. 
Þe þridde, 
man nedeþ defence for strange enemyes 
and for strif and discord 
þat may falle in þe cite. 
And to þes þre seruen 
þe þre forseyde maners of men. 
Touchinge mete and drynke, 
lond tilers suffisen so 
þat we vn|derstonde 
by lond tiliers 
al þat tilien lond and vynegerdes and alle herdes 
þat kepen bestes. 
But touchinge hous and clothynge 
and oþere crafty thinges craftes men suffisen. 
And fiƷtynge men serueþ for þe defence. 
Þanne þe forseyde philosofer ordeyned 
in þis wise of multitude of citeseyns. 
Þe seconde, 
he entermetede hym 
and tretede of distinccioun of possessions and delede al þe contraye 
in alle þe demaynes of þe citee 
in þre parties – þe holy partie, comyn, 
and propre – 
and asynned þe holy parti 
to seruice of God, 
þe comyn partie to fiƷttyng men, 
and þe propre partie to lond tileers. 
And he seide that demaynes ben best ideled Ʒif a partie 
is assigned to hem 
þat seruen God in temples, 
and he cleped þat partie þe holy partie. 
And þe partie þat is assigned for 15 fightynge men 
is icleped þe comyn partye, 
for fiƷtynge men scholde haue in þe comyn cost 
for defence of þe contrey. 
And þe partie of lond tylers 
was icleped þe propre partie. 
And to craftes men 
was no partie assigned for hem, 
for þei myƷte lyue by here craft. 
Also fiƷttynge men hauen no demayne 
as it were here owne 
but me Ʒeaf hem armere; 
but 20 he seide þat he schulde be som comyne demayne certayne 
and þerof fightynge men scholde haue here leuynge as it were of comyn tresorie. 
Þe þridde, 
he entermetede hym of distynccioun of domes and seide 
þat comyne domes 
scholde be of þre 
as citeseyns pleteþ of þre: 
of greef, of wrong, and of deþ. 
For eche þat misdooþ 
anoþer greueþ his thinges 
and harmeþ þe persone, 
and þat in twey manere wise – 
oþer doyng hym schame 
and despite oþer greuynge hym | wiþ strokes and wondes. 
And mysdoynge touchinge þynges 
he clepede nocumentum, greef oþer noye; 
and mysdoynge touchynge schame and despite he clepeþ iniuria, wrong; 
and mysdoynge wiþ strokes and wondes 
he clepede deeþ, 
for ‡ [suche ben iordeynede to] deþ, 
for eche strong passioun appayreþ þe substaunce. 
Þe ferþe, 
he entermetede [hym] of ‡ distinccioun of iuges and seide 
þat þer scholde be twey manere of iuges 
and twey Ʒelde halles – oon ordenarie and comyne 
in þe whiche causes scholde be treted and ipleted, 
and anoþer principal to þe whiche peles scholde be brouƷt, 
as þe philosofer telleþ. 
He wolde þat in þe principalle Ʒelde halle scholde be twey wyse men 
of lawe ichose of olde men so þat Ʒif eny euel doom 
were iƷeue in þe comyn Ʒelde halle, 
þilke chosen olde men of good fame scholde do riƷt. 
Þe fifte, 
he entermetede of manere of demyng 
and wolde þat in eiþer Ʒelde halle, 
boþe in þe principal 
and in þe comyne, 
doom scholde be Ʒeue withoute 
consaillynge of iuges 
and tretyng bytwene hemself. 
For whanne þe cause were iherd, 
eche iuge by hymself schulde avise hym 
and afterward scholde write þe sentence in a scrowe. 
And Ʒif he þat isaccused 
is condempnedatte fulle, 
þe iuge schal write a symple condempnacioun; 
and Ʒif it is iquytte, 
he schal bere a voide scrowe. 
But Ʒif he is som del condempned 
and som dele aquyte, 
þe iuge schal declare þat by writyng. 
And, ii Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer telleþ þe pos[ic]ioun 
of þe forseide philosofer 
and telleþ cause 
whi Ypodomus made suche ordinaunce. 
For he trowede | 
þat Ʒif þe iuges were compellede to telle here avise, 
on caas he wolde be foriswore 
and drede to telle here 
avice tofore oþere men. 
Þerfore he ordeynede 
þat eche scholde preueylich write his owne sentence. 
Þe sixte, 
he made certeyn lawes 
touchynge diuerse manere persones 
and made foure suche lawes. 
Þe firste þerof touchede wise men; 
þe seconde, fiƷtynge men; 
þe þridde, 
al þe puple; 
þe firþe, þe prince. 
Touchinge wise men [he] iordeyned 
þat eche man 
þat fond vp and deuysed 
eny thing spedful 
to þe citee scholde þerfore haue þewe worschip. 
And touchinge fiƷtynge men he ordeynede 
þat here children 
þat were dede in bataille for defence of þe contrey 
and of þe citee scholde fonge of þe comune tresori. 
Þe þridde, 
touching al þe puple 
he ordeyneþ 
þat al þe puple, 
fiƷtyng men and craftes and lond tiliers, 
schuld come ifere to choise and elec- cioun of þe prince. 
For as it semeth 
by his speche 
þat he wolde not 
þat þe prince scholde be prince by heritage 
but by chois and eleccioun; 
and he assignede þat eleccioun 
to al þe puple. 
Þe ferþe, 
touchinge þe prince ichose he ordeyned 
þat þe prince schulde haue principal charge of þre: 
[of] comyn good, of pilgrimes, 
and of orphanes. 
And he clepede orphanes generalliche alle persones vnmyƷty þat myƷte not by hemself 
meynteyne here owne riƷt. 
For it longeþ 
to a kyng 
and to a prince 
þat scholde be kepere of riƷt to haue special charge of þe comyn profit 
and of pilgrymes 
and of vnmyƷty persones, 
for oþere wolle sone do soche persones wrong 
for þei mowe not defende his owne riƷt. Chapter XX Moche good we hauen of oppynyons 
of olde philosofres 
for in here 
speche 
þei seide manye soth sawes. 
And þeiƷ þei hadde seide not soth Ʒit here 
opynyons scholde be rehersed; 
and, ii Methaphisice, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat we schulde þonke hem 
þat sparenþe sothe and discorden 
fro oure oppinyons, 
for som tyme suche doynges 
reþeþ oure witte. 
For ofte euel speche of som men exciten and areren 
þe witte of oþer men to deme riƷtfulliche. 
Þanne we rehersen þe opynyoun of Ypodomus, 
for in his polecye he seide manye goode sentences 
and ordeynede wel many thinges. 
But as it longeþ to þis doynge, 
folwynge of þe philosofer, 
ii Poleticorum, 
we may blame Ypodomus 
for þre: first, 
for he made contrarie ordenance; 
þe seconde, 
for þe manere 
þat he ordeyned in demynge; 
þe þridde, 
for lawes 
þat he made touchynge diuerse manere of persones. 
And firste, 
þe forseide philosofer failede 
makynge contrarie ordinance and statutes, 
for þe staat of þe distinccioun of citeseyns 
may not stonde wiþ þe statute of choys 
and eleccioun of þe prince. 
For Ʒif a citee scholde be distyngwed 
in þre parties 
as he seith in fightynge men, 
[craftes men, 
and lond tiliers, 
and onliche fiƷtynge men hauen armure] 
þat myƷte allegge and abate strif 
and discord 
in þe citee 
and defende þe contrey fro enemyes, 
þanne þe fiƷtynge moste be more myöty 
þan þe lond tiliers 
and craftes men ifere; 
for alwey þe more mysty men 
hauen þe maystrie and ben lordes 
and men doun gladliche wrong 
whanne þei mowe. 
Þan Ʒif it were so, craftes men and lond tiliers scholde haue no part in policie wise materes and ordenaunce of þe citee; 
and also þe fiƷtynge men wolde not | 
suffre hem to haue voce 
in þe eleccion of þe prince. 
Þanne þe statute þat seith þat alle þe puple schulde chese þe prince 
may not stonde with þe statute of fightynge men for þei ben more myƷty þanne alle þe oþere 
and oonliche þei hauen armure. 
Þe seconde, Ypodomus faillede in þe manere 
þat he ordeyned in demyng, 
for he wolde þat iuges scholde not treete togeders 
in þe Ʒelde halle of þe sentences 
þat scholde be Ʒeue. 
But as þe philosofer seith, 
he demede not þat þey myƷte trete preueyliche at home. 
And þis may be despreued by twey weyes. First, 
for of þis manere demynge comeþ more wronge 
and also lasse worschep to þe iuges, 
for iuges doun rather amys Ʒif 
þei mowen speke togedres priuelich 
þan to speke togederes oponlich in þe Ʒeld halle; 
and Ʒif þei mowe not telle eche oþer his avis, 
þei scholde sonnere do amys 
in þis manere þan in anoþer wise. 
And so þe philosofer meneþ 
þat in al good p[ole]cies þat bien good is iordeyned þe contrarie of Ypodomus his ordenaunce where it is iordeyned 
þat iuges mowe speke togeders 
opunlich þat þei mowe not haue counsaille 
in a preuey place. 
Also þe forseide manere failleþ 
for in som domes it nedeþ þat iuges trete 
and haue colacioun togeders 
– as Ʒif þe iuges discorden, 
it nedeþ þat þei haue collacioun togeders 
and trete whos sentence is best. 
Þe þridde, 
þe forsayde philosofer faillede in lawes 
þat he made touchinge diuerse manere persones, 
and namliche in lawes 
þat he made touchinge [wi]s men. 
For Ʒif eche wise man 
þat fyndeþ eny thing 
þat is spedful schulde haue þewe worschep, 
þanne wise men | wolde fonde to fynde newe lawes 
and to declare þat newe lawes 
ben good and profitable to þe cite. 
[Þanne Ʒif in þe cite lawes scholde chaunge alwey, 
þat is perilous to þe 
cite,] for lawes hauen greet effecte 
of longe durynge of tyme; 
wherfore Ʒif lawes 
were al alwey inewed, 
þei scholde lese here vertue and effecte. 
Þanne Ypodomus his statute of hym 
þat fyndeþ ouƷt þat is spedful to a citee semeþ good atte first sigt, 
but it is perelous 
as þe philosofer seith. 
Þanne in þes Ypodomus failleþ. 
And Ʒif a failleþ in oþere thinges, 
and Ʒif principate scholde passe by eleccioun oþer by heritage, 
and Ʒif lawes scholde be 
[inew]ed Ʒif eny defaute 
is ifounde þerinne, 
and oþere thinges 
þat mowe bee axede 
in þis matere schal be treted inneremore atte folle. 
But it is inow 
at þis tyme 
þat oppynyons of philosofers 
ben itouched 
and in þis endeþ 
þe firste partie of þis þridde book 
in þe whiche it is itreted of rewelyng of regne and of citee. Book III Part II Secunda pars tercii libri. 
How citees scholde be reweled 
in tyme of pees 
and what thinges 
and how manye scholde be knowe 
in suche rewelynge. 
How manye manere good principates 
þer bien 
and how manye euel. 
Bettere it is þat cite be reweled by oon þanne by manye. 
By what resons it may be preued 
þat bettere it is 
þat a citee be reweled 
by manye þanne by oon 
and how þe resons ben assoilled. 
Bettere it is þat citee and regne be ireweled 
by heritage and successioun þan by choys and eleccioun. 
In what thinges a kyng scholde passe oþere men. 
Tirandise is þe worste principate 
and kynges scholde be war 
þat here regne tume not in to tyraundise. 
What is þe kynges office 
and how þei scholde haue hym in rewelynge of regne. 
What thinges and how manye a verrey kyng scholde do 
þe whiche a tyrant feyneþ for to doo. 
By what cautels 
and by how manye a tyrand fondeþ 
to kepe hym-self 
in his lordschipe. 
To how many cautels ben þe cautels 
of a tirand reducte 
and where of kynges scholde be waar leste þei be tiraundes, 
for þe workes of kynges ben good 
and þe workes of tyrauntes ben euele. 
Hit is foule and detestable Ʒif a kyng is a tyraunde, 
for al þat is euel in euele princes 
is al igadred in to tyraundise. 
It is most spedful to kynges 
to rewle þe puple arygt 
and to be waar 
þat he be not tyrauntes; 
for by cause of many causes, 
sugettes liggen in awayte 
and risen aƷenst tyrandise. 
A kyng scholde be most waar 
þat he be not a tyrant, 
for tyraundise is destroyed 
in moo maners 
þan principate of a kyng. 
What thinges destroyen rewelyng 
and how manye thinges 
a kyng moot doo for to abyde in his principate. 
What ben counsailles 
and where of counsailles schal be take. 
What is counsaille 
and how it is imaad. 
What manere consailloures kynges scholde haue. 
How manye thinges counsaillours | 
scholde knowe of þe whiche consaile scholde be itake. 
As it is possible alle thinges scholde be termyned 
by lawe and fewe by owne wille of iuges. 
How processe scholde be maad in doom 
and what wordes scholde be forbode tofore þe iuge. What thinges 
and how many nedeþ iuges for to haue for to deme ariƷt. 
What thinges and how many nedede iuges for to knowe 
for to spare men 
and for to be more mylde þan cruel. 
Ther ben diuerse lawes 
and diuerce rigttes, 
and positif lawe and oþere lawes 
ben reducte to lawe of kynde. 
How þe lawe þat hatte ius gencium, 
þe lawe of naciouns 
and lawe of citees, 
ben distyngwed fro lawe of kynde. 
What manere lawe scholde be þe lawe of mankynde 
and it is profitable 
to þe regne and citee to make suche lawes. 
NouƷt eche man scholde make lawe; 
and Ʒif lawe scholde haue strengþe and kynde, 
a mot be cryed 
and iknowe among þe puple. 
What thinges and how many dedes lawes scholde conteyne 
þat kynges and princes scholde make. 
Wheþer it were betere 
þat a cite 
were irewled 
by þe beste lawe 
oþer by þe beste kyng. 
Al withoute lawe of kynde of men 
nedeþ þe lawe of God 
and of þe gospel. 
As it is possible lawes 
of contreye scholde be holde, 
and it is to be waar of chaunchinge of lawes. What is a citee 
and what is a regne 
and what manere puple 
scholde be in regne and in citee. 
Þanne a regne is best and puple is best 
whanne þerinne ben manye mene persones. 
But it is spedful with greet reuerence 
to be obedient to kynges and ío 
to kepe here lawes with greet besynesse. 
How citeseyns and alle men of a regne scholde haue hemself 
so þat kynges be not imeued 
to wrathe aƷenst hem. 
How kynges and princes scholde bere hymself for to be loued of þe puple 
and how for to be drad, and þeiö eiþer be nedful Ʒut he scholde desire more for to be loued þanne idrad. 
Incipit ⌜par[s]⌝ secund[a] Egidii ⌜lib[ri]⌝ tercii. Chapter I 
After þat by help of God 
we hauen imaad ende of þe firste partie of þis þridde book 
and rehersed certeyn preambules 
and nedful menes 
to þe purpos 
and rehersed diuerse opynyons of þe philosofer 
þat ordeynede policies 
and tauƷte art of rewelyng of citee and of regne, 
now it is to tretyng of þe oþere twey parties of rewelyng of cite and of regne in tyme of pees 
and of suche rewelyng 
in tyme of werre. 
Þanne it is to wetynge 
þat as in a tyme of werre 
a cite scholde be defended by armere, 
so in tyme of pees 
þei scholde be reweled by riƷtful lawes and vsages 
þat ben apreued 
and hauen strengþe of lawe. 
Þanne it semeþ 
þat armere 
in tyme of werre 
is ilikned to lawes 
in tyme of pees. 
For it is iknowe 
þat in tyme of [pees] cite 
and regne scholde be reweled 
by riƷtful lawes 
and vsages apreued, 
it may be sone iknowe how many thinges moste be iknowe in suche rewelyng. 
[And it semeþ, iii Poleticorum, 
þe philosopher toucheþ foure 
þat moste be knowe in rewelyng] of cite; 
and þes ben þe prince, 
þe counsaile, 
þe Ʒelde halle, 
and þe puple. 
And by selue lawes 
by þe whiche a citee | 
scholde be reweled 
in tyme of pees 
we may preue 
by twey weyes 
þat þes foure moste be knowe 
in rewelyng of citee in tyme of pees. 
Þe first wey is itake by thinges 
þat nedeþ to lawe; 
þe seconde, 
by þe ende wherfore 
þe lawe is imaad. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For as it longeþ to þis doynge, 
for to haue riƷtful rewelynge 
by lawe nedeþ foure. First, 
þat þe lawes be wel imaad 
by wit and wisdome. 
Þe seconde, 
þat þei be wel ikepte 
by cyuel myƷt and powere. 
Þe þridde, 
þat dedes of citeseyns be 5 riƷtfulliche 
ydemed by lawes 
ymaad and ikepte. 
Þe ferþe and þe laste, 
þat ordenaunce þat is conteyned 
in lawes ben wel ikepte for pesible staat of þe puple. 
And good kepynge of lawes longeþ to þe prince; 
þerfore, v Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat þe prince scholde be kepere of riƷt. 
Þat is to menynge of riƷtful lawes and statutes, 
for laweful statutes 
mowe be cleped certein lawes. 
And good makynge of lawes 
by witte and wisdome longeþ 
to þe counsaille; 
for princes scholde haue so wise consaillours 
þat þei myƷte fynde and make ordenance 
þat þe puple scholde þeweliche kepe. 
And good demyng by lawes 
þat ben imaad by consaillours 
and ikepte by þe prince 
it longeth to þe Ʒeld halle 
and to þe iuges, 
and þe puple schal deme dedes 
of þe citeseyns 
by suche lawes. 
And alle citeseins 
and alle þe puple scholde kepe 
and holde þe lawes. 
Wherfore Ʒif þynges ben iknowe þat nedeþ to þat a citee is wel irewled in tyme of pees 
in suche rewelynge, 
it nedeþ to make mencioun of þe forsaide foure. 
Þe seconde wey to | 
preue þe same is itake by þe ende wherfore lawes ben imaad; 
for his entent þat maken lawes scholde be 
for we schulde haue þyng þat is good and profitable 
and voide noy and greef, 
and do riƷt and voide vnriƷt, 
and gete þyng þat is to preysynge and leue þyng 
þat is to blamyng. 
Of good doynge 
and of greuous doyng is counsaille; 
of riƷt and vnriƷt is þe Ʒeld halle and doom; 
but of þyng þat is to blamynge and preysynge is commaundyng and forbedyng 
þat may longe to al þe puple. 
For namelich by lawes þe puple scholde be brouƷt in to do wel, 
for in lawes 
what is to preysynge is commaunded 
and what is to blamynge is forbode. 20 f. 131v 25 
Þanne he þat wolde termyne 
how a citee scholde be rewled 
in tyme of pees mot knowe not onliche what manere man scholde be prince 
þat scholde Ʒeue and kepe lawes, 
but also what manere men scholde be counsaillours 
þat schulde knowe what is profitable 
and what is greuous, 
and what maner men schulde be iugis of lond 
þat schuld deme what is riƷt 
and what is wrong, 
and what maner men þe pupil schulde be. 
Þe puple schulde be demed 
to do faire doynge 
þat is to preysynge 
and to leue foule doyng 
þat is to blamyng. 
Þan of al þat forsaide foure of principate, 
of conseile, of Ʒeld hal, 
and of þe puple, 
as it longeþ to a philosofer, 
we schal schortlich speke 
in þis ii partie of þis iii book; 
but first we schal speke of suche principate. Chapter II Tercio Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer distingweth sex maner principatus 
of þe whiche iii ben good and þre ben euel. 
For þe principatus 
þat been iclepede ‡ þe regne (<monarchia>), aristocracia, policia ben þre good prmcipates; tiraundise, eligarchia, demo|graccia ben euel principates. 
For þere þe philosofer techeþ 
to knowe good principates 
fro euele. 
For Ʒif in eny lordschipes 
oþer principate 
þe comyn profit is desired 
and profit of alle citeseins 
after here astaat, 
þanne it is good and riƷtful; 
but Ʒif profit of certeyn men is desired and ouersettynge of oþere, 
so it is euel and vnriƷtful. 
Þanne in þis wise 
by þe philosofers wey we may take suffisauntes principates 
to þe wrongful and riƷtful, 
for in a citee oþer 
in a nacioun is oo lord, fewe, oþer manye lordes. 
Ʒif oo lord desireth comyn profit 
and profite of sogettes, 
þanne þat lordschipe 
is icleped monarchia 
and a regne: 
for a kyng scholde desire comyn profite. 
And Ʒif þat oon lord desireth not þe comyn profit 
but ouersetteþ oþer men 
by cyuel myƷt 
and powere and ordeyneþ 
alle thinges 
to his owne profit, 
he is no kyng but a tyraunt. 
Panne of lord- schepe of oon comeþ 
tweyne principates – oon riƷtful whanne a kyng is lord 
for þe comyn profit, 
and anoþer wrongful whanne a tyraund is prince for his owne profit. 
But som tyme a citee is irewelede not 
by oo lord bote 
by som lordes 
and þat by fewe. 
For we seie ofte 
in þe citee of Rome 
þat whanne þat senatours faillede, 
in þe mene tyme or anoþer senatour 
was ichose 
alle þe puple of Rome 
were irewled by fewe men. 
For twelf men were ichose 
þat were good men and of good fame 
and þei reweled al þe citee, 
and so euel dedes 
were distingwed 
by diuersete of principates. 
And of som euele dede it was iseide 
þat it was idoo 
in þe tyme of a senatoure, 
and of som euel dede | it was iseid 
þat it was idoo 
in þe tyme of good men. 
Ʒif a cite is ireweled not 
by on allone 
but by fewe, 
þanne þilke fewe ben vertuous 
and goode and desiren þe comyn profit; 
and þanne suche a principate 
is icleped aristocracia, 
þat is to menyng þe pryncipate 
of good men and vertuous. And þerof it comeþ 
þat þe gretteste men in þe puple 
þat scholde rewle puple 
ben icleped optimates, 
for þei þat scholde be ouer oþer men scholde be optimi, best. 
But [i]f þilke fewe men 
þat rewelen ben not vertuous 
noþer desiren þe comyn profit 
but here owne wynnynge 
and ben riche and ouersetten oþer men and desiren here owne profit, 
suche a principate 
is icleped eligarchia 
as it were þe principate of riche men. 
Þanne of lordschipe of fewe men comeþ 
twey manere of principates; 
on is vertuous 
as whanne som men ben lordes 
for þei ben vertuous and desiren þe comyn profit, 
and þe oþer is wrongful 
as whanne sum men ben lordes 
not for þei ben good men 
but for þei ben riche men 
and ouersetteþ oþer men. 
Þe þridde, principates mowe be distingwed 
by þat þat manye men ben lordes in a citee. 
For comounliche in citees of Italie 
ben manye lordes 
as al þe puple, 
for þere nedeþ assent of alle þe puple 
in makynge of statutes 
and in chesyng of lordes 
and greet officers 
and also of iuges 
to correcte trespasses. 
For alwey þere þei a potestate oþer a lord be ichose and ipledet to rewle þe citee, 
Ʒut þe puple haþ more lordschepe 
of þe cite 
þanne þe potestate 
and lord þat | 
is ichose and icleped. 
For al þe puple schal chese hym and amende hym 
Ʒif þei doun amys, 
and þe puple maken statutes 
þat suche a lord mot nedes hoolde. 
Þanne in suche a principate, 
þere manye ben lordes 
as al þe puple, 
is desired profit of nedy men, 
of mene persones, 
of riche men, 
and of alle men 
as heere astat axeþ; 
þanne þat principate is riƷtful. 
And for suche a principate haþ no name, 
þe philosofer Ʒeueþ it a comyne name 
and clepe it policia. 
Policia and ordenaunce of cite 
is al on touchinge 
alle þe principates 
þat ben þerinne, 
and principaliche þe cheef principate 
þat hath lordschipe of al þe oþere. 
For polecia stondeþ more 
in ordre of þe cheef principate 
þat is in a cite. 
And eche ordenaunce of a cite 
may be cleped policia. 
Nathales riƷtful principate of þe puple 
is icleped policia, 
for it hath no propre name. 
And Ʒif it is riƷtful, 
we may clepe it suche a principate gubemacioun populi, 
rewelyng of þe puple. 
But Ʒif þe puple þat haþ suche lordschepe desireþ 
not profit of alle men 
after here owne astaat but tyraundiseþ 
and ouersetteþ riche men, 
þanne is þer anoþer maner principate 
and hatte democracia in Grew. 
And we may clepe suche principate 
wrongful doyng of þe puple. 
Þanne it is declared how manye principates 
þer ben 
and whiche þerof ben gcod 
and whiche ben iuel. Chapter III 
For we thinken to declare what is best policie 
and which is best principate, 
after that we hauen itold maners of principates 
and whiche þerof ben riƷt|ful 
and whiche wrongful, 
it is to declarynge among principates 
which is þe beste. 
And comynliche foure weyes ben assigned to preue 
þat a regne is best principate, 
and þat it is bettre 
þat a cite oþer a prouynce be irewled 
by on þan by manye, 
wheþer þilke manye be swiþe manye oþer fewe. 
Þe firste wey is itake 
by vnyte and pees 
þat scholde be desired 
in a cite and in a regne as þe ende. 
Þe seconde, 
by cyuel myƷt and power 
þat nedeþ 
to þe rewelyng of a citee. 
Þe þridde, 
by doynge þat we seen in kynde. 
Þe ferþe and last, 
by doynge þat we hauen ilemed 
by experience and asay in rewelyng of citees. 30 f. 132v 35 
Þe firste is declared in þis wise. 
For pees and vnytee of citeseyns scholde be his final entent 
þat Ʒeueþ þe lawe as heel is fynal entent of þe phisician, 
and he þat is by hymself 
on may make best þis vnyte and acord. 
For in a principate 
is more vnyte Ʒif 
onliche oon prince 
is lord þanne þei manye princes were lordes. 
For Ʒif þer ben manye princes 
in a principate, 
neuere pees may bee 
in suche a principate 
but þulke manye princes be oned and acordyng; 
for al þyng is for som cause 
and þe cause is more parfit. 
Þanne Ʒif pees and acord is among citeseyns 
vnder manye princes, 
and ben as it were oon, 
þanne Ʒif þer were oonlich oon prince among hem, 
here pees myƷte not sone be disturbled. 
Þe seconde wey to preue 
þe same is itake 
by ciuyl myƷt and power 
þat nedeþ 
in rewelyng of citees. 
For þe more a vertue is ioned, 
þe more stronge it is; 
for eche vertue ioned 
is more strong 
þan itself departed, 
as it is | declared in libro De Causis 
and in Proposicionibus Procli. 
For we seen þat Ʒif manye men drawen a schep 
but þei be oned 
and drawe alle at ones, 
þey schulle neuere drawe þe schip. 
But Ʒif al þe strengþe 
þat is in manye men drawynge 
were igadred 
al in to oon manere, 
þanne þe strengþe were more ioned 
and þerfore þei were þe more strong in drawynge. 
Wherfore [Ʒif] 
a[l] cyuel myƷt and powere þat is in manye princes 
were igadred in oon prince, 
þanne þat prince were more myƷty 
þan þe oþer 
and myƷte betere rewle þe polecie and þe citee. 
Þe þridde wey is itake by doynge 
þat we seen in kynde. 
For in al kynde rewelyng alwey 
al þat rewelyng is iordeyned 
to som oon 
þat is cheef; 
as Ʒif in þe same body 
ben diuerse membres iordeyned to diuerce office and diuerse meuynges, 
þat is on 
[me]mbre of whos meuynge springeþ 
al þe oþer meuynges in þe body 
as al meuyng of oþer membris comeþ of meuyng of þe hert. 
Also Ʒif on þyng is imade of many and diuerse elementes, 
þer is on as þe soule rewlyng and holdyng togeders 
þe elementes in þe bodi of a beest þat þat body 
of a best holde togeders. 
Þerfore, 
circa fine[m] primy libri De Anima, 
it is iseid 
þat þe soule conteyneth þe body more þan aƷenward. 
Also oon body of heuene 
as þe firste meuable body 
rewleþ þe nethere meuynges 
and is cause þerof. 
And in al þe worlde is oon God 
þat rewleþ and disposeþ 
alle oþere thinges. 
Also for it is kyndelich for bene to lyue in companye, 
it is kyndelich for hem to be vnder oo kyn[g]e. 
Þanne Ʒif we taken heede 
of alle kyndelich thinges, 
alwey we schal see þat eche multitude is | reducte 
and ireweled by oon þat is chef. 
For as it is kyndeliche 
þat multitude comeþ of oon, 
so it is kyndelich 
þat it be reducte in to oon 
and be ireweled by on. 
Þanne þe rewelynge of puple 
and of multitude is good Ʒif it is riƷtful, 
but þe rewelyng of fewe is bettre 
for it comeþ nere to vnyte. 
And best rewelyng is monarchia 
þat is þe rewelyng of oon kyng, 
for þerinne is more parfite vnyte.35 f. 133r 40 
Þe ferþe wey is itake by doynge 
þat we seen in contrees and in citees. 
For we knowen and seen þat citees 
þat ben not vnder oon kyng ben in pouert and in meschef 
and not in pees 
but ben agreued wiþ stryf and werre. 
And citees þat ben vnder oon kyng aƷenward, 
and hauen non werre 
but pees and plente. Chapter IV 
It semeth þat þe philosofer, iii Poleticorum, 
toucheth þre resons 
by þe whiche it semeth ipreued 
þat betere it is 
þat a citee oþer 
a prouynce be reweled 
by many þan by oon. 
For þre semeþ nedful in a prince 
to rewle wel his puple. For first, he schal haue good witte and resoun; 
þe seconde, ri^tful entent and desire; 
þe þridde, 
parfit stedefastnesse. 
Herby we may take þre resons to preue 
þat it is good 
þat many ben princes 
and not onliche oon. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For manye iƷene mowe see more þan oon 
and manye hondes mowe do more þan on and manye wittes mowe knowe more þan oon, 
wherfore Ʒif many ben princes, 
resoun is þe more cleer for þey knowen more þan oon prince alone. 
Þerfore, iii Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat manye suche princes maken as it | 
were oo man wiþ manye eyƷen and many hondes. 
Wherfore suche principate is best, 
for suche a man ymaad in þat wise and multitude of princes 
is most myƷty in principate. 
Þe seconde wey to preue þe same is itake 
by riƷtful entent and desire 
þat nedeþ in a prince. 
And þe prince haþ good entent 
Ʒif he desire 
not his owne profit 
but þe comyn profit. 
Þanne þe lasse þe comyn profit is desired, 
þe worse is þe principate. 
But Ʒif manye ben princes þeiƷ he<y> desire here owne profit Ʒut þey leuen not al þe desire of comyn profit. 
But Ʒif oon is prince alone 
and he desireþ his owne profit, 
for þe profit of oon 
is as it were pryuat benemeng profit, 
þat desireth his owne profit 
at al forsakeþ 
as it were 
at al þe desire of comyn profit. 
Þanne bettere it is 
to manye be princes þan oon. 
Þe þridde wey is itake by stedfastnesse 
þat nedeþ in a prince. 
For a prince scholde be riƷtful and stedefast rewle so 
þat he scholde not be so corrupte noþer 
ouercome 
by wrathe noþer 
by coueitise noþer 
by oþer passions. But as þe philosofer seith, 
oon is sonnere 
ouercome þanne manye. 
Þanne better it is 
þat manye be lordes 
þan oon. 
Þanne it is to wetynge 
þat þe philosofre, 
iii Poleticorum, 
treteþ þis doute and assigneþ manye resons to preue 
þat best it is 
þat manye be lordes. 
And afterward in þe same book 
he toucheþ certeyne poyntes 
by þe whiche suche obieccions and argumentes 
mowe be assoilled. 
And it is not to vnderstondynge 
þat þe philosofer wolde mene þat lordschepe of manye 
is sympliche bettere 
þan lordschipe of oon Ʒif 
eiþer is riƷtful, 
| for he seith ofte in þe same Politikes 
þat a regne is most worthi principate; 
for among riƷtful principates, principate of on þat is icleped a regne is best. 
And among euele principates of oon 
þe principate 
þat is comonliche icleped tiraundise is þe worste. 
But heere of it schal be spoke here after. 
For it schal be declared 
þat þe prince<ipate> 
of a kyng is best; 
so þat to þe more good 
þe more euel is contrarie, 
þe principate of a tyraunt is worst. 
And it is not bettre 
þat manye ben lordes riƷtfulliche þan oon; 
nathalees neuere manye mowe riƷtfulliche be lordes but in so moche 
as þei holden þe stede of on 
and hauen among hem vnite and acord. 35 40 f. 133v 5 
But as it is iseide tofore, 
eche thing is for som cause 
and þe cause is more parfit. 
Wherfore Ʒif manye ben lordes 
riƷtfulliche in so moche 
as þei holden in stede of on, 
it is more riƷtful 
and more worthi 
þat on haue riƷtful principate 
in þew manere þan many. 
Þanne it is to grauntynge 
þat a regne is most worthi principate 
and þat it is betere 
þat oon haue riƷtful lordschepe þanne manye. But for to assoille þe forsayde obieccions and argumentes 
it is to wetynge 
þat for manye men knowen mo þynges þan oon man doþ, 
and oon is corupte sonere þan manye, 
and manye mowe not so erre out of þe entencioun of þe comyne profit 
as oon may allone, 
þerfore Ʒif an hool principate is imaad 
and on prince oþer on kynge is lord 
in al þe hool principate 
oþer in al þe hool regne, 
þe philosofer, iii Poleticorum, 
seith þat thilke prince oþer kyng scholde take to hym manye wise men 
for to haue manye eyen, 
and manye good | men and vertuouse 
to haue manye feet and hondes, 
and scholde be so imaad 
on man 
with many eyene, many fete, and many hondes. 
Þanne it may not be iseid 
þat suche on prince 
knowe not many thynges; 
for in so moche 
as it longeþ 
to rewelyng of þe regne, 
it semeþ þat thilke prince 
oþer kyng knoweþ alle thinges 
þat alle thilke wise men knowen. 
Noþer it may be seid 
þat he may be sone corupte. 
For whanne a kyng desireth 
to be riƷtful lord, 
it is not possible 
þat he be corrupte 
but al þe counsaille and alle þe wyse men and good men 
þat he ‡ asocieth to hym ben peruerted and corrupted also. 
For suche on desireþ 
most þe comyn profit. 
Þerfore Ʒif it is so, 
it is worthi þat he be prince; 
and Ʒif it is oþer wise 
as Ʒif he forsakeþ 
consaile and companye of wise men 
and goode and folweþ 
his owne heed 
and his owne appetite, 
þanne he is no kynge 
but a tyraunt. 
Þanne it were not bettere 
þat suche on were a lord 
þanne manye 
but his lordschipe were worst; 
for as it is declared 
tofore and schal be declared here 
after more playnliche, 
tyranddyse is þe worste principate. Chapter V 
On caas som man wolde wene þat bettere it is þat dignitee of kyng 
and of prince passe by eleccioun þan by heritage. 
For Ʒif þe soþenesse of þis doute 
is iseie atte firste siƷt, 
it semeþ 
þat he þat douteþ 
wheþer it is bettere 
þat dignite of a kyng passe by eleccion 
oþer by heritage douteþ wheþer it is better to make a lord 
by art oþer by lot. 
For Ʒif a kyng is maad by eleccioun, 
it semeþ þat suche rewelyng 
is not iput in aventure and fortune 
but it is imaad by art 
for þe best and wisest | scholde be ichose. 
But Ʒif it is ido by heritage, 
þe rewelynge is iput apon a lot in auenture and fortune, 
for it is vncerteyne what manere man 
þe child schal be 
þat schal haue þe heritage 
and dignyte of kyng. 
Þanne sympliche for to speke, 
betere it is þat a prince 
be maad by eleccioun þan by heritage. 
But [for] in þis matere comynliche men 
hauen corupte appetite, 
takynge heede of beryng [and] condicions of men þat we seen by assay, 
it semeþ more spedful to regne and to cite 
þat þe lord be maad by heritage þan by eleccioun. 
And Ʒif condicions of men ben iknowe, 
by þre weyes we may declare þat bettere it is 
þat suche rewelynge passe 
by heritage 
þan by eleccioun. 
Þe firste wey is itake 
by þe selue kyng 
þat reweleþ þe puple; 
þe seconde, 
by þe sone 
þat schal be heire; 
þe þridde by þe puple 
þat schal be so irewlet. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For, ii Poleticorum, 
þe philos- ofer seiþ 
þat it passeþ spekynge of greet likynge it is to haue som what proper, 
for what is kyndelich 
may not be idel and veyn and it is kyndeliche 
þat eche man loue hymself; 
þanne þe more 
þat a kyng troweþ 
þat a regne 
is his owne proper good, 
þe more kyndeliche he is 
þe more besy aboute þe profit of þe regne. 
Þanne Ʒif a kyng troweþ 
þat he schal be prince 
ouer a regne not onliche 
for his lif tyme 
but also his heritage 
in his owne children, 
so he wol trowe þe more 
þat þe good of þe regne is his owne good 
and be more besy þere aboute. 
And for al þe kynde of þe fader resteþ in children and fadres ben gret|liche imeued to plesynge and likynge of þe children, 
þerfore a kyng wiþ besynesse 
þat a may he is imeued to brynge 
and kepe þe regne in good estaat Ʒif he knoweþ 
þat his children 
schal be lordes þerof. 
But, iii Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer treteþ of þis mater and seith þat it is hard 
þat fadres mowe so betake rewelynge of regne 
to here owne children, 
and meneþ þat þat it is as it were a vertue of God and passeþ þe manere of mankynde. 
But on caas þe philosofer seide so for comyn- liche 
in olde tyme kynges 
bycome tyrantes and þe heritage of þe fader dureth not longe to þe children in þat wise. 
Oþer Ʒif it is sympliche iseide 
þat þat is a vertue of God, 
but for kynges and princes bere hem- self weel in seruice of God, 
selde þe children regnen after here fadres, 
and Ʒif þe children regnen, 
vnneþe oþer neuere regneþ 
þe [children] children. 
Þanne by þe kyng, 
for þei scholde be þe more besy 
aboute þe prophit of þe regne, 
we may argue 
þat it is spedful 
þat rewelyng of regne passeþ 
to children by heritage. 
Þe seconde wey to preue þe same is itake by hym 
þat schal fonge þe charge of þe regne. 
For as here maners 
þat ben neweliche imaad riche ben comynliche worse 
þan here maners 
þat ben riche in olde tyme, 
so here maners 
þat ben newe imaad lordes 
and hauen cyuel myƷt 
and powere ben worse 
þanne here maners 
þat ben lordes of olde tyme. 
For suche conneþ not suffre fortune, 
for newe reryng and vpsettynge of a kyng is as it were a | certeyne vnkunnynge of dignyte of a kyng. 
For comynliche suche bycomen tyrauntes and proute of herte 
and regnen vnwiseliche. 
But Ʒif rewelyng of regne passeþ by heritage, 
here children ben not mysproud noþer to highe of herte, 
for þei accounten not greet þeiö þei haue 
þat lordschepe 
þat here fader hadde. 
Þanne by þe children 
þat schal haue þe fader heritage, 
for þe regne scholde not be vnwiseliche 
ireweled noþer kynges rewle turne in to tyraundise, 
it is spedful þat kynges dignite passe by heritage 
to þe ofspryng. f. 134v 5 10 Þe þridde wey is itake by þe puple 
þat he schal be rewled 
by suche rewelynge. 
For vsage is as it were þe oþer kynde, 
wherfore by vsage rewelyng is imade 
as it were kyndelych rewelyng. 
Þanne Ʒif þe puple 
is obedient longe tyme 
by vsage 
to þe fadres 
and to þe children, 
þei ben as it were kyndelich inclyned 
to be obedient with good wille. 
Þanne for al þyng þat is aƷenst wille 
is swiþe heuy and chargous, 
for þe puple scholde with þe better wille 
be obedient to þe kynges hestes, 
it is spedful 
þat kynges dignite passe by heritage. Þanne settynge and hauynge 
a certeyne hous lynage of þe whiche þe kyng schal be take 
seseþ plee and stryf, 
and doþ awey tyraundise, 
and is as it were kynde †Ʒift of God†. 
It seseth strif and plee, 
for ofte among chesers is strif 
for þe eleccioun of a prince; 
þerfore pees of þe regne is disturbled. 
And it doþ awey tyraundise for, 
as it is declared tofore, 
þei þat regnen by eleccioun louen not so wel þe profit of þe regne 
as þei þat regnen by heritage; 
| 
and for a tiraund desireth 
not profit of þe regne, 
‡ suche bycomen tyrauntes to sone. 
Also þat maken a kynde †Ʒift† for þe puple 
is as it were kyndeliche inclined 
to be obedient to þe hestes 
of a kyng 
þat regneþ by heritage. 
And herby it may be knowe 
þat it is not oonliche spedful to regne to haue a certeyn lynage 
of þe whiche þe kyng schal be take, 
but also it nedeþ to declare þe persone. 
For as strif and plee riseþ Ʒif it is vnknowe 
of what lynage þe kyng scholde be take, 
so riseþ strif and plee Ʒif 
it is vnknowe what persone and what lynage scholde be kyng oþer prince. 
And it is not hard to declare suche a persone; 
for Ʒif kynges dignite passe 
by heritage to þe ofspring, 
it mot passe to þe children. 
For by þe lyne of sibradenesse children 
ben nexte to þe fader and moder. 
And suche dignyte mot sonnere passe to maales þan to femels, 
for þe maal can more resoun 
þan þe femel 
and is more bold of herte 
and lasse folweþ passions. 
And among maales suche dignite mot passe raþer 
to þe eldeste sone þanne to þe oþer; 
for as þe philosofer seith in Poletikes, it is semelich 
þat þe Ʒongere be obedient to þe eldere. 
And also comonliche þe faders louen most þe eldeste sones. 
And for þe kyng scholde haue more charge of þe comyne profit of þe regne, 
it is spedful þat a regne passe by heritage to þe eldeste sone 
for þe fader scholde be more besy 
aboute þe profit of þe regne wetyng 
þat it schal falle 
to his owne sone 
þat he loueþ best. 
And Ʒif me seith þat som tyme þe fader loueþ best þe Ʒongere children, 
suche resons and obieccions 
mowe be sone assoilled, 
for workes and particuler doynge of | mankynde falleþ not al vnder riƷt rewle 
and riƷt rekenyng. 
Þanne in suche matier 
it is inow to trete probableliche 
and to make lawes 
þat ben comynliche good and trewe. 
And for it was itouched tofore honde 
þat Ʒif kynges dignite passe by heritage, 
þanne þe rewelynge of þe regne [is iput] 
vppon hap, fortune and lotte, 
for it is vnknowe 
what manere man 
þe kynges sone wol be good oþer euel, 
it schal be seid 
þat vnneþe ben eny doynges of man- kynde 
but þei be som del iput in perel. 
But it nedeþ most to be waar of doynges 
þat ben most iputte in peril. 
And we seen þat many harmes riseþ 
where no kynde lord 
is in citees and regne, 
for som tyme þerinne is no rewelere. 
And Ʒif þer is a rewelere, 
comynliche a tyrant[y]seþ. 
For we haue iseie manye harmes 
in suche rewelyng 
þat were to longe 
to rekene al arewe. 
Þanne we may saye þat it is spedful 
to þe regne 
þat þe rewelynge passe 
to þe kynges sone by heritage. 
And Ʒif eny defaute 
is in þe kynges sone 
þat schal be heire, 
it may be amended by wise men and goode 
þat þe kyng scholde asocie to hym as hondes and eyƷene. 
But kynges and princes ben foule to blame Ʒif þei ben not swiþe besy þat here children be tauƷt in 30uþe to haue connynge and good maners, 
for comyn profit of al þe regne stondeþ þerinne. 
And it is not inow 
þat for þe eldeste sone schal regne þat þerfore 
onlich he schulde be besyliche itauƷt, 
for it is vnknowe what God ordeyneth 
and it is vnknowe 
wheþere þe eldere sone schal lyue 
and be eyre oþer noo. 
Þerfore for þe co|myn profit scholde not be in perile, 
alle þe children scholde be besiliche ikepte and itauƷt. Chapter VI Qvynto Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer rekeneþ 
þre thinges 
in þe whiche a kyng 
scholde passe oþere men, 
for he declareth þat 
in olde tyme kynges were imaad 
by þre manere passynge. First, 
by passynge in Ʒeuynge. 
For þe puple perseyueþ 
not but sencible good 
and ben þerfore strongliche imeued to loue hem 
þat ben liberal and 5eaf manye Ʒiftes and grete. 
Þerfore in olde tyme manye kynges were imaad in þat wise; 
for Ʒif a man were goodlich to þe puple and Ʒaf hem Ʒiftes, 
þey wolde loue hym 
and make hym kyng. 
Þe seconde, 
a man may be maad kyng 
for passynge in vertuous dedes. 
For goode men and vertuous louen 
þe comyn profit more 
þan priuate profit, 
þerfore he þat is iholde vertuous 
amonge þe puple 
is iholde worthi to be kyng. 
Þe þridde, 
ofte som man was imaad kyng 
for passynge in myƷt and dignite. 
For it is probable to gentel men noble 
and myƷti ben more aschamed 
þan oþere men to do vile dedes, 
and for comynliche suche men ben worthi oþere ben iholde worthi to be princes, 
þerfore in þis wise manye were imaad kynges in olde tyme. 
Þanne Ʒif a kyng is igendred 
and imaad kyng for suche passynges, 
Ʒif his generacioun is riƷtful, 
it nedeþ þat his passynge 
be þe more large and p[ar]fit 
whanne he is kyng in dede. 
For we seeþ in kynde generaciouns 
þat Ʒif fuyre is igendred 
by rarefaccioun and strecchinge and heete, 
| for kynde worthe a fuyre 
by hetynge and strecchinge, 
it nedeþ þat strecchynge 
and hete be more parfit 
in þe fuyre whanne it is igendred 
and is fuyre in dede. 
Þanne Ʒif passynge in Ʒiftes and in vertuous dedes and in myƷt and power may be cause whi a man may lawefulliche be imaad kyng, 
it is semelich 
þat suche passynge 
be more parfit in a prince 
whanne he is prince in dede. 10 f. 135v 15 
As it longeþ to þis doyng, 
a kyng þat wol regne ariƷt scholde be besy aboute þre: first, 
for to be loued of þe puple; 
þe seconde, 
to be besy 
for þe comyne profit; 
þe þridde, 
for to chaste hem 
þat meueþ stryf and discord 
and disturbleth þe puple. 
Wherfore it is spedful for a kyng to haue þe forseide 
þre manere of passynges. 
For Ʒif he is large of Ʒiftes, 
he schal be loued of þe puple. 
And Ʒif he passeþ in vertuous dedes, 
he schal be besy for þe comyn profit; 
for Ʒif a vertue desireþ good most, 
he desireth most good. 
Þanne for þe comyn profit 
and good is more good 
þan eny synguler good, 
a good man and vertuous schal be more besy 
for þe comyne good 
and profit þan for any priuat 
þat is benemyng good and propre. 
Þe þridde, 
it is spedful þat [he] haue greet cyuel myƷt and powere 
for to chaste risares, scomers, 
þat wolde desturble pees of þe regne. 
For it is iknowe 
where inne a kyng scholde passe oþere men, 
it is to declarynge what diuersete 
is bytwene a kyng and a tyraunt. 
And, v Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer toucheþ foure diuersete 
bytwene a tyraunt and a kyng. 
Þe first, 
for a kyng takeþ heede to þe | comyne profit 
and a tyrand to his owne profit. 
For a kyngdome 
is a riƷtful principate 
and tyraundise 
is euel and wrongful lordschipe, 
for þe comune profit is better þanne þe profit of on euel and wrongful lord 
þat forsaketh þe comyne profit 
and takeþ hede 
to his owne profit. 
Of þis first diuersete folweþ þe seconde, 
þat a tyraunt desyreth likynge good 
and a kyng worschepful good. 
For as it passeþ speche how moche likynge a man haþ 
in his owne good, 
so it is as it were passynge speche 
how grete worschep folweþ 
and how greet worschep 
he is worthi 
þat desireth þe comyn profit. 
Wherfore Ʒif a tyraunt desire his owne profit, 
it folweþ 
þat he desireth likynge good; 
but a kyng desireth worschepeful good, 
for he desireth þe comyn profit. 
And of þis seconde diuersete folweþ þeþridde, 
þat atyraunt desireth moneye. 
For a tyraunt forsakeþ 
þe comune profit and telleþ no pris 
but of his owne likynge and desireþ 
þerfore most money trowynge by moneye to haue suche likynge. 
But a kyng desireþ vertue 
and þat citeseyns be vertuous 
for þerof comeþ 
most worschepful good and comyne profit. 
And of þis diuersete þe þridde 
folweþ þe ferþe, 
þat a tyraunt wol not haue to warde of his bodye citeseyns ibore in his owne regne 
but he betakeþ to straungers 
al þe warde and kepyng of his body. 
But a kyng doþ aƷenward, 
for he knoweþ 
þat he haþ most charge of þe comyne profit of þe regne 
and of þe comunes 
and tresteþ most in hem 
þat ben of þe regne, 
and haþ þerfore wardeyns 
for his body 
of his owne and not of | straungers. Chapter VII 
By foure weyes we may declare þat tyraundise 
is þe worste lordschepe. 
Þe firste is itake 
for suche lordschipe desireth 
lest þe comyne profit. 
Þe seconde, 
for it is most vnkyndeliche lordschepe. 
Þe þridde, 
for it is most greuous and neyful. 
Þe ferþe, 
for it letteþ most profit of cyteseyns. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For Ʒif a kyng haþ lordschepe, 
he desireth þe comyne profit; 
for he is no kyng 
but he be vertuous 
and desire þe comyn profit. 
And so, iii Poleticorum, 
it is iseide 
þat suche a prince 
is as þeiƷ it were departed 
in manye oþer 
as it were prince of multitude, 
for suche a prince desireþ profit of manye. 
Also Ʒif manye ben lordes 
for þei ben riche 
oþer iholde vertuous, 
oþer Ʒif al þe puple 
haþ þe lordschipe for þei þat ben lordes 
in þat wyse desireth 
not but here owne profit, 
Ʒut in som wise þei desiren þe comyn profit for in þat wise were manye princes 
and al profit of money 
is in som wise comyn profit. 
But Ʒif a tyraunt is lord, 
for oon þat is lord 
in þat wise desireþ 
not but his owne profit, 
he desireþ not þe comyn profit. 
Þanne for a principate 
is not riƷtful 
but it be in som wise goddysch, 
and for þerinne principaliche 
þe comyn profit 
scholde be desired 
þat is more goddische 
þan eny singuler profit, 
þe lasse comyn profit is desired in tyrauntes 
þer is þe worse principate. 
Circa principium quarti Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer toucheþ 
þis resoun and seith þat as a regne is best and worthiest policie 
(þat is of kyng), 
so tiraundise is þe worste. 
And þe cause is, 
as it is iseide | þer, 
for‡ tyraundise 
ys most ferre fro policie 
(þat is wis domes and good ordenances) 
of þe comyn profit. 
Þe seconde wey to preue þe same is itake 
for suche lordschipe 
is most vnkyndeliche. 
For worching is kyndeliche 
whanne me worcheþ 
in a thing as me scholde, 
wherfore a regne is kyndelich ireweled 
whan men þat ben þerinne ben ireweled 
as able to be reweled. 
And for man haþ fre wil and resoun, 
man is kyndeliche ireweled 
as he is able to be reweled 
whanne he serueþ wilfulliche and isobedient freliche. 
Þe more wilful lordschepe of men is, 
þe more kyndeliche it scholde be cleped. 
Þanne tirandise is þe worste principate, 
for it is most vnwilful 
and most aƷenst kynde, 
for it is most greuous to þe sogettes. 
And, iiii Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer toucheþ 
þis resoun and seith 
þat tyrandise 
is þe worste principate, 
for no fre man suffreth wilfulliche suche principate. 
Þe þridde wey is itake 
for suche principate 
is moste noyful and greuous. 
For as þe principate of a kyng 
is most profitable 
for it is most ioned, 
so tyraundise is most noyful and greuous. 
For whanne oon is lord in a principate, 
vertue and myƷt is ioned 
þere and is þerfore best 
oþer worst principate. 
For Ʒif þe prince haþ riƷtful desire, 
þanne he is a kyng 
and þe principate is best for by cause of myƷt yoned 
for he may do moche good. 
And Ʒif þe prince hath euel desire and wrongful, 
þanne he is a tyraunt 
and þe principate is worst, 
for by cause þat his myƷt is ioned he may do moche harme. 
And, [v] Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer toucheþ þis resoun and seith 
þat tyraundise is | eligarchia extrema 
(þat is þe worst extrema), 
†anoynture† 
for it is most greuous to sogettes. Treuysa: 
whanne fewe men ben lordes 
and ben not good and vertuous 
but riche and myƷty and louen not þe comune profit 
but desireþ here owne profite 
and ouersetteþ oþer men, 
suche principate 
is icleped eliga[r]chia. 
And here tirandise is icleped þe worst eligarchia, 
for it is most greuous to sogettes. 
Þe ferþe wey is itake 
for suche lor[d]schipe letteþ most profit of citesens. 
For a tyraunt fondeþ 
not onliche to do hem harme 
þat ben in þe regne 
but also he is besy 
to lette here most profit. 
And, v Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer toucheþ certeyne profites 
þe whiche a tyraunt fondeþ 
for to lette: pees, vertues and science; 
for tyrauntes wolle not þat citeseyns 
haue pees and acord among hemsilf. 
Also þei wol not þat citeseyns 
be magnifici and vertuous. 
(Magnificus is he þat makeþ grete workes). 
Also tyrauntes wolle not þat citeseyns 
be wise and redy. And whi tirauntes letteþ þe forseide good 
and profit in cyteseyns 
it schal be seid herafter. 
And be it inow 
at þis tyme to knowe 
þat tyraundise 
is þe worste principate 
for þe forsaide resons. 
And it is not hard to know 
þat kynges scholde be most besiliche ywaar 
þat þei be not princes by tyraundise; 
for þe worse lordschepe a prince vseþ, 
þe worse prince he is. 
Wherfore 
Ʒ¿f a kyng scholde do al þe besynesse 
þat he be not þe worste, 
he scholde be most war 
þat he be not lord by tyraundise, 
þat is þe worst principate. Chapter VIII Ʒif a kyng oþer a prince wol wel rewle his men 
and desireth to knowe 
what is his | offices, 
he schal besiliche taak hede of kyndelich thinges. 
For Ʒif al kynde comeþ of God 
þat is cheef prince 
and kyng ofkynges and reweleþ 
al þe worlde and kynde moste riƷtfulliche, 
by rewelyng þat we seen springe 
in kyndeliche thinges 
and of þat rewelynge scholde springe þe rewlinge 
þat scholde be itauƷt 
in art of reweling of kyngis, 
for art folweþ kynde. 
And in kynde we seen þat first, kynde Ʒeueþ to þynges wherby þei mowe come to here ende. 
Þe seconde, 
þei Ʒeuen hem whereby þei mowe putte of lette‡s. 
Þe þridde, 
by suche Ʒiftes þei Ʒeuen hem 
wherby þei mow come to here ende. 
As firste, 
kynde Ʒeueþ to þe fuyre liƷt- nesse wherby it may meue vpward. 
[Þe seconde, 
kynde Ʒeueþ þerto hete wherby it putteþ of contraries. 
Þe þridde by þat it takeþ of 
kynde þe fuyre kyndeliche meueþ vpward.] 
Þanne to good rewelyng 
and kyndeliche nedeþ þre. Firste, 
þat þe puple be so disposed 
þat þei mowe come to þe ende 
þat is desired. Þe seconde, 
þat thinges be put of 
þat letteþ comynge to suche an ende. 
Þe þridde, 
þat it be irewled 
and iholpe to suche an ende. 
For we seen of an arwe 
þat schal be schote to a certeyne marke 
þat first, 
it is imaad riƷt and euene 
þat it may þe bettere come to þe mark. 
Þe seconde, 
it is ifethered 
þat it may þe bettere kerue þe ayere 
þat it be not ilet to come to þe marke. 
Þe þridde, 
it is ischote and ireweled to þe marke. 
Þanne a kyng and eche rewelere of puple is as it were an archere 
and þe puple is as it were an arwe 
þat schal be reweled to an ende as to good. 
Þanne þre longeþ 
to a kynges office, 
for first, 
þei scholde be besy 
þat his men haue wherby 
þei mowe come to þe ende 
þat is desired. 
Þe seconde | wey, 
þei schulde putte of lettes. 
Þe þridde, 
þei scholde rewle his men 
to þe ende. 
And þynges þat seruen 
þat puple may come to þe ende 
þat is desired and lyue wel ben þre – vertues, kunynge, and outward good. 
Þanne a kyng scholde be besy 
þat in his regne 
be studie of lettres 
and þat þer be manye wise men and slei[Ʒ]e. 
For wher is wisdom and welle of writyng 
it nedeþ þat al þe puple haue som lore þerof. 
Þanne for men 
þat ben in þe regne scholde not be wrapped 
in derkenesse of vnkunnynge, 
it longeth to kynges and princes 
to be ful besy 
for studie scole of letters. 
And as it schal be declared herafter, 
Ʒif a lord of a regne 
avaunceþ 
not þe studie noþer he wol þat his men 
be wise and connynge, 
he is not a kyng but a tyrand. 
Þe seconde, 
for to come to þe ende 
þat is desired serueþ habitis, 
goode disposiciouns, and vertues. 
For it is not inow to knowe þe ende and haue þe inwit byschene 
but a man be vertuous 
and haue ordinate appetite 
þat he may wilne to come to þe ende. 
Þanne it longeþ to þe rector 
of a regne to ordeyne his sogettes to vertues. 
Þe þridde, 
for to come to þe ende 
þat is desired 
in wise lif outward thinges 
helpeþ as instrumentes. 
Þanne kynges and princes schulde rewle citees and regnes so þat here sogettes haue inow of outward thinges [þat] serue to lyue wel and to come to þe ende þat is desired in wise lif. 
And how þat it may be do 
and how a cite scholde be ordeyned for to haue þerinne þynges 
þat seruen to suffisaunt lyuynge 
þeig it be som deel declared tofore Ʒit it schal be more clerelich declared here after. 
For it is | iknowe þat it longeþ 
to a kynges office 
to be besy aboute þynges 
by þe whiche þe puple may come to þe ende þat he desireþ, 
it is to declaryng how it longeþ to kynges and princes to putte of lettes 
þat letten men 
to come to þe ende, 
þe whiche ben þre. 
And on þerof springeþ 
as it were of kynde; 
þe oþer, 
of schrewednesse of men; 
þe þridde, 
of euel wille of enemyes. 
Þe firste is declared in þis wise. 
For in hemself men ben dedliche 
and mot nedes dye, 
þerfore it is þat [for] 
þei mowe not in hemself dure alwey, 
þei desiren kyndeliche 
to be perpetual 
in here owne children 
wheþer þe children 
be kyndelich of here owne body 
oþer ifonge oþer wise 
and icleped here children. (And a childe þat is ifonge in þat wise is icleped filius adoptiuus, 
a wel welled sone.) 
For it semeþ to a man 
þat he myƷte lyue Ʒif he myƷte ordeyne his eyre 
after his owne wille after his deþ. 
Þanne þe pesible staat 
may be disturbled and pees of þe citee and ende 
þat is desired in politik lif but kynges and princes be besy how heritage schal passe to hem 
þat comeþ 
after hem þat passeþ. 
Þanne remeuyng of oon 
þat most letteþ good wise lif is good ordeynynge how here heritage 
þat deyen may come to þe ofspringe. 
Þe seconde, pesible astaat of citee 
and of regne 
is som tyme ilette 
by schrewednesse of citeseyns. 
For som ben so schrewede 
þat þei wollen alwey greue oþere men. 
Þanne for þe pees of þe regne 
scholde not be ilette, 
kynges and princes scholde be besy 
to destroye passynge euel doers 
and to chaste hem 
þat trespassen. 
Þe þridde, 
suche lete comeþ 
of euel wil of enemyes. 
For it were as it were not worthi 
to voide inward desese 
but outward peril were iput of, 
þanne it longeþ 
to a kynges office 
to be so besy about cyuel myƷt and powere and aboute sleyþe of armede men 
þat he may put of woodnesse of enemyes. 
And how þat scholde be do it 
schal be declared playnliche 
in þe þridde partie 
of þis þridde book 
in þe tretis of batailles. 
For it is declared how kynges and princes scholde be besy how here puple scholde haue wherby to come to þe ende 
þat he desireth, 
and how þei scholde putte of lettees, 
it is to declaryng 
how þei scholde rewle hem to þe ende 
and heere ben þre. 
For first, 
þei scholde amende þe defautes – as Ʒif ouƷt lackeþ 
to good rewelyng of þe citee, 
þat scholde be amended. 
And þat may be doo 
by counsaille of wise men, 
and herof we schul speke herafter. 
Þe seconde, good ordenance and good statute 
is to be kepte and iholde. 
Þe þridde, good doers and namelich‡ he 
þat helpeth þe comyn profit scholde be rewarded. 
For þei amendyng of defautes 
and kepyng of good ordenance 
helpe moche þat þe puple 
may be reweled to þe ende, 
Ʒut it semeþ 
þat rewardynge of good dedes helpeþ most. 
For as it is iseid, 
iii Ethicorum, 
capitulo De Fortytudine, 
among hem ben men most fortes, 
among þe whiche men þat ben fortes 
ben most iworscheped. 
(And heere he is icleped fortis 
þat wol fi^te whanne it nedeþ 
and whare it nedeþ 
and for what cause it nedeþ 
and aƷenst wham it nedeþ 
and as it nedeþ.) 
Also among hem þ[er] ben wise men and goode, 
among þe whiche wise men | 
and good ben a rewarded. 
Þanne it semeþ 
þat it longeþ 
to a kynges office 
to be besy aboute þe forsaide þre. Chapter IX 
We may rekene ten þat a verrey kyng scholde do and a tyraunt fayneþ 
to do þe same. 
And þeiƷ þulke ten be som del conteyned in þynges 
þat ben itreted tofore, 
nathales for as it is ofte iseide 
in moral matere general 
speche serueþ not no[r] profiteþ litel, 
þerfore it is wel idoo 
to rekene þulke ten al arewe. Forst, 
for it longeþ 
þat a verrey kyng 
to be most besy 
aboute þe comyne profit 
and profit of þe regne, 
and þat þei be besi to spende rentes 
in profite of þe comynte and of þe regne. 
And tyrauntes feyneþ 
to do þe same, 
naþales þei doun not þe same. 
But as þe philosofer seith, 
þei spenden in hoores and strumpetes, 
in flaterers and in oþere vnworthie persones. 
Þe seconde, þe rector of a regne 
scholde not onlich ordeyne 
and spende rentes 
in þe profite of comynte of þe regne, 
but also þei schulde specialich kepe and saue þe good 
of þe comynte 
and of þe regne 
and þe lawes of þe regne. 
And þeiƷ tirauntes feyne 
to do þe same, 
Ʒit þei doun it not 
but þei pelien oþere men and bynemen here good. 
Þe þridde, 
kyng and prince scholde not schewe hemself to dredful and cruel noþer be to homeliche, 
but þei scholde seme sad persones and worschepful; 
and þat may not be withoute vertue. 
Þerfore a verray kyng 
is verrey vertuous, 
and a tiraunt is not vertuous 
but feyneþ hymself vertuous. 
Þe ferþe, 
a kyng scholde despise noon 
of his sogettes 
and do no man wrong 
noþer in douƷttres noþer in wyues, 
noþer in persone | noþer in oþer thinges. 
And Ʒif it happeþ 
þat eny of þe regne forfeteþ, 
noþer for despit noþer for euel wil, 
but for comyn good he schal chaste hym by lawe. 
And tyrauntƷ doun not so; 
but for þei desiren moneye and likynge, 
þei don wrong to citeseyns in wyues and douƷtres and reyuen hem here good. f. 138r 40 
Þe fifte, kynges and princes scholde not onliche louye here owne mayne 
and be homelych and louye gentel men 
and noble and barouns 
and oþere by þe whiche þe good astaat of þe regne may be saued, 
but also, 
as þe philosofer seith in Politikes, 
þei scholde make here owne wifes 
be hoomliche and goodlich 
to þe wyues of þe forsayde men. 
For wymmen drawen swiþe here housbondes 
to here owne wille, 
for eche man is inclyned so 
þat he wol not displese his owne leuest. 
Wherfore Ʒif wyfes of noble men 
and of oþere 
by þe whiche good staat 
of þe regne is isaued seyþe 
þat þei ben dispised of þe princes 
wif oþer of a kynges wif, 
þei wol make here housbondes 
to meue parties 
to make strif 
in þe regne 
oþer in þe principate. 
Þanne a good rector of a regne oþer 
of a citee scholde bere hymself in þis wise. 
And a tyraunt doun not so, 
but he is mysproute of herte 
and despisen oþere. 
Wherfore noþer he noþer persones þat ben nyƷ hem ben goodlich to oþere men. 
Þanne it semeþ 
þat a tyraunt haþ to doyng of a verrey kyng 
but þat is ifeyned; 
for in so moche as he is a tyraunt, 
he doþ not as verrey kyng in dede. 
Þe sixte, 
a verrey kyng scholde be moderate 
in mete and drynke 
and in seruice of Venus, 
for he scholde not be despised 
of his sogettes. 
For as it is iseide, 
v Ethicorum, 
he þat is sobre 
is not despised 
but he þat | is dronke. 
And tyrauntes don not so 
for þei desiren not but here owne profit and money and lust and likynge. 
And for lust most and likynge 
is in mete and drynke 
and in sencible lecherie, 
tirauntes withoute refraynynge 
vsen such lust and likynge. 
And Ʒit worse, 
as þe philosofer meneþ, 
v Poleticorum, 
manye tyrauntes not onliche ben intemporat 
but also þey wollen be holde intemporate and trowen 
þat men acounten hem 
in greet felicite Ʒif þei ben eche day 
in greet outrage of mete and drynke, 
in dronkenesse and in greet festes. 
But þei scholde not do 
in þat wise for Ʒif þei were temporate 
for þei scholde not be despised of þe puple, 
þei scholde not schewe intemporatnesse. 
For so[b]eyrnesse 
is ipreysed as intemporatnesse of lecherie and glotonie ben despised. 
Þe seuenþe, 
a verrey kyng scholde heighte and strengþe citees, casteles and townes 
þat ben in þe regne 
þat it be þe betere iknowe 
þat he be procurator 
of þe comyne profit 
whanne a tyraund 
is besy aboute his owne profit. 
Þe eiƷte, þe philosofer seith 
þat a verrey kyng scholde worschepe wyse men and goode and strangers 
so þat me scholde wene 
þat þey scholde not be so yworschepped in here owne contreye þouƷ þei were at home. 
And so don not tyrauntes, 
and it schal be declared heerafter 
for he worschepeth not wise men 
and goode but destroyen hem. 
Þe nynþe, 
a verrey kyng scholde not by wrong 
and vnriƷt byneme oþere men lordschepe. 
For as it is iseid [in] Poletic[is] reynyng dureþ 
lengere ouer fewe þan ouer manye. 
And þat is nameliche soþ 
Ʒif suche multitude of cyuel myƷt 
and power is ygete with may|strie and wiþ wrong. 
And, v Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer reherseþ 
how a certeyn kyng hadde ilefte a partye of his kyngdom on caas 
for he hadde longe holde it with wrong. 
But he was blamed of his wif þat seide 
þat he scholde be aschamed to leue 
a lasse regne to his children 
þanne he hadde ifonge of his fader. 
Þe kyng answerde and seide 
þat þeiƷ he lefte hem 
a lasse regne in quantite, 
nathalees he lefte to hem 
a grettere regne 
and more induryng of tyme. 
And tyrauntes doþ not so; 
for þeiƷ þei feyne here wey to doo riƷtfullich, 
Ʒut in manye doynges 
þei maken here lordschepe more and more wrongfulliche and benemen 
oþere men here heritages 
with maystrie and with wrong. f. 135v 5 10 Þe tenþe and þe laste, 
kynges scholde bere hem wel in Goddes seruice. 
For as þe philosofer meneþ, 
þe puple is soget 
at þe folle to a kyng 
þat þei trowen 
þat werschepeþ God and haþ God to his frend. 
For þe puple trowen 
þat suche a kyng doþ alwey riƷtfullich 
and no þyng wrongfulliche. 
But heerto we may make anoþer betere resoun sayeng 
þat Ʒif God 
is a kynges frend 
by his ordenaunce 
þat knoweþ al þyng, 
and by his myƷte þat no þyng may wiþstonde, 
as it is spedful 
for his sauacioun 
he schal alwey wel spede in his workes and dedes. 
Also ofte for holynesse of þe kyng God doþ moche good to hem 
þat ben in þe regne. 
And last we saide þat a kyng scholde bere hym wel 
in Goddes seruice, 
for þat scholde be þe ende and complement (folfillyng) of oþere, 
for þerto alle oþere doynges ben iordey|ned. 
Þanne a verrey kyng 
in dede bereþ hym wel in Goddes seruice verreyliche, 
and a tyraunt 
is not suche oon 
but feyne on caas 
þat he is suche on. Chapter X Qvinto Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer toucheþ manye cauteles of þe whiche as it longeþ 
to þis doyng we may rekene ten 
by þe wyche a tyraunt fondeþ 
to kepe hymself 
in his lordschipe. 
Þe firste cautel of a tyrant 
is sleynge and destroyenge of excellent men. 
For whanne a tyraunt loueþ 
not but his owne profit, 
excellent men and noble 
þat ben in þe regne mowe not suffry 
þat but arisen aƷenst hym. 
And whanne þe tyraunt knoweþ 
þat he is a suche oon, 
he þenkeþ not 
but how he may destroye and slee excellent men. 
And Ʒut whanne som men wolle be tyrauntes, 
he sleeth not onliche oþere excellent men 
but also þei poysenen here owne breþeren 
and here owne nyƷe cosyns; 
and þat is tokene of þe worste tyrandise. 
But a verrey kyng doþ aƷenward and desireþ 
þe comyn profit and knoweþ 
þat he is iloued 
among þe comyns 
of þe regne and sleeth not 
but saueþ excellent men gentile and noble, 
and moche more his owne cosyns 
by þe whiche þe good staat 
of þe regne 
may be saued and ikepte.30 35 40 
Þe seconde cautel of a tyraund 
is destroyenge of wise men. 
For þei knowen þat þei doun aƷenst resoun and desireth not comyn profit 
but his owne, 
þerfore þey wolde 
þat alle his sogettes were lewede and vnkonnynge 
lest þei knowe 
al his wikkednesse 
and excite puple aƷenst hym. 
For alwey he þat doþ 
euele hateþ rigt and loueþ not wise men, 
| for þei wolde not 
þat his workes be blamed; 
wherfore a tyraunt doþ 
euel workes and dedes 
and destroyen wise men 
wiþ al his myƷt. 
And a verrey kyng doþ 
þe verrey contrarie knowyng 
þat he doþ riƷt and resoun and saueþ wise men. 
And he avaunseþ and worschepeþ hem for þei 
k[n]owen his good doynge and conforteþ þe puple to louye hym. 
Þe þridde is notsuffryng studies and loore. 
For a tyraund in so moche 
as he is soche 
oon not onliche destroyeth wise men, 
but also for he barreth 
þe wey and forbedeþ loore and studies 
lest som men be wise; 
for alwey he dredeþ 
to be vndertake 
and iblamed by wisdome. 
And a verrey kyng of þe contrarie, 
and he avaunceþ 
and saueþ studies say- enge þat þe comyneprofit 
and good staat of þe regne 
is amended 
in so moche 
as it longeþ 
to þe tente of þe principate. 
Þe ferþe, he wolde not suffre felowschipes noþer gaderyng of frendes, 
for a tyraunt wol þat citeseyns and oþere þat ben in þe regne be not felowys noþer iknowe togeders. 
For as þe philosofer seiþ, 
knoweleche makeþ fey and trist for by cause 
þat a man knoweþ anoþer and tristeþ on hym; 
and a tyrant loueþ not þat, 
for þei dreden lest citeseyns trist eche in oþer and rise aƷenst hym for wronges 
þat he doþ hem. 
And a verrey kyng doþ agenward 
and soffreþ companye and felowschipe of citeseyns 
and wol þat citeseyns 
be knowe eche 
to oþer and triste eche in oþer. 
For by cause þat he desireþ 
þe profit of þe citeseyns and of sogettes, 
it is kyndelich 
þat he be loued of hem. 
Wherfore he wol þat þei ben accorded 
and ioned and come togeders, 
for þanne þei louen þe profit of þe kyng 
þe more wilful|liche and wiþ on herte. 
For it were an iuel puple 
at al þat knewe 
þat þei hauen a verray kyng 
þat louen þe comyn profit 
but þei louede þe kyng aƷenward. 
Þe fifte cautel of a tyraunt 
is to haue manye spies 
and assaye and knowe alle thinges 
þat [c]iteseyns don. For whanne tyrauntes ‡ knowe þat þei ben not beloued of þe puple 
for þei don hem 
moche harme and greuen hem 
in manye maner wise, 
þei wollen haue manye spies 
þat þei mote mete wiþ hym Ʒif eny of þe puple 
casteþ ouƷt aƷenst hem 
þat ben tirantes. 
For whanne citeseyns trowen 
þat a tiraunt haþ manye spies, 
þei dar not come togeders 
to caste ouƷt aƷest hym. 
For þeiƷ no spie be among hem so igadred, 
Ʒut alwey þei dreden 
lest som spies be among hem. 
And a verrey kyng kepeþ not haue suche spies among citeseyns and among hem þat ben in þe regne 
but among enemyes and strangers. 
And whether kynges scholde haue spies 
in þe regne for oþer cause þan for risyng of þe puple aƷenste hem it schal be seide here after. 
At þis tyme it is inowƷ to knowe 
þat a kyng nedeþ not spies 
as a tyraunt nedeþ.35 40 Þe sixte cautel of a tyraunt [is] not oonliche he wol not suffre felowschipe and companyes and frendschipe, 
but also felawschepe and frendschipe 
þat is imaad 
þei wolle desturble and destroye. 
For by frendes tyrauntes wol destroye frendes, 
and þe puple by grete men, 
and lordes by hemself. 
For þei seen while discord 
is among citeseyns 
and among riche men, 
his powere may not sone be withstonde | 
for þanne eche partye dreden oþere so 
þat noþer partye arisen aƷenst þe tyraunt. 
And a verrey kyng doþ aƷenward, 
disturbleþ not hem 
þat ben in þe regne 
but norscheth pees 
and acord amon[g] hem. 
For elles he were not a verrey kyng, 
for elles he desireþ not þe comyn profit. 
Þe seuenþe, 
he wol make his sogettes 
so pore þat þe tiraunt nedeþ no warde. 
For tyrauntes wollen þat here sogettes be so pore þat þei ben 
so ioccupied to gete here liflode þanne þei mowe not a while to caste ouƷt aƷenst þe tyrauntes 
and þat tyrauntes 
nedeþ nouƷt to haue warde 
by cause of þe cely sogettes. 
And for a verray kyng desireþ profit of þe sogettes, 
he greueth hem not noþer makeþ 
hem pore but fondeþ 
for to do hem good and profite. 
Þe eiƷte cautel, 
a tyraunt procureth werreþ, 
and sendeþ fiƷttynge men to straunge contrees, 
and alwey to make hem fiƷte þat ben in þe regne 
so þat þei ben alwey ioccupied 
with charge of werre so þat þei mowe not a while to caste ouƷt aƷenst þe tyraunt. 
And a verrey kyng greueþ 
not þe sogettes 
meuynge werre and bataille, 
for he loueþ þe comyn profit 
and wol not þerfore 
þat þei þat ben in þe regne take worre 
but for deffence of þe regne 
oþer for som riƷtful cause. 
Þe nynþe is warde of his body 
not by hem 
þat ben of þe regne, 
for þei tristen not on hem, 
but by strangers. 
And a verrey kyng doþ þe con- trarie 
as it is playnlich iseid tofore. 
Þe tenþe cautel of a tyraunt [is] 
whanne he haþ maad strif and partees in þe regne, 
by oon partie he wol destroye anoþer 
and departe þe loue. 
And | a kyng doþ 
þe contrarie and makeþ non diuysions and partees in þe regne. 
But Ʒif þere be dyuysions 
and parties þerinne, 
he fondeþ to amende it. Chapter XI 
Alle þe cautels of tyrantes 
þat we rekened in þe chapitre 
tofore þe philosofer reducte to foure, 
for tyrauntes desiren foure. First, 
þat here sogettes be vnkonnynge. 
Þe seconde, 
þat þei be cowardes 
and feynt of herte. 
Þe þridde, þat noon of hem triste on oþer. 
Þe ferþe, 
þat þei ben so pore 
and so ouersette 
þat þei mowe not rise aƷenste tirauntes. 
To þis foure 
alle þe forseide ben redu[c]te. 
For as it longeþ 
to þis doynge Ʒif 
eny man scholde arise 
oþer 
cast ouƷt aƷenst a tyraunt, 
it comeþ of oon of þe forseide foure. 
And first, 
it may come of grete hert so 
þat þe riser is so gret of hert 
þat he acounteþ 
no þingges greet. 
Þe seconde, 
of wit and of sleyþe so 
þat he troweþ 
to caste and deuyse so manye weyes and wiles þat he may destroye þe tyrant. 
Þe þridde, 
it may come of myƷt and power so 
þat þe risere troweþ and tristeþ in oþere citeseyns 
þat þei wolle helpe hym wiþ ciuel myƷt and power to rise 
and to destroye þe tyraunt. 
Þ[e ferþ]e, 
it may come of gret idelnesse 
as Ʒif citeseyns 
ben ful riche and ful idel; 
for þe þouƷt of mankynde 
may not ben idel, 
whan citeseyns ben not ioccupied 
to gete here liflode þey bythenken and casten 
in what wise þei mowe maak partie 
and desturble þe citee and rise aƷenst gouernours of citeseyns. Þanne aƷenst þis foure tyrantes fonden to destroye excellent men 
þat þeyre sogettes 
be not bold of herte; 
and fondeþ to destroye wyse men 
and lette scooles and studies 
þat þei þat | 
ben in þe regne ben lewede and vnkonnynge; 
and suffreþ not companye 
and felowschipe among citeseyns 
for noon of hem scholde triste on oþer; 
and fondeþ to make hem pore 
and to occupie hem in werre 
and in oþer doynge 
þat þei ben not idel. 
Þes ben þe cautels of tyrauntes. 15 f.140r 20 
But on caas no man 
is ful tiraunt, 
for euel destroyeth itself; 
and Ʒif any were ful tyraunt, 
it myƷt not be suffred 
as it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum. 
And on caas vnneþe oþere 
is eny ful kyng 
but he do som tiraundise; 
for Ʒif a kyng dede no tyraundise, 
he were as it were an half god. 
Þerfore it is 
þat Iordes hauen 
som what of cautels of tyrauntes 
and som what of good doyng of kynges. 
And þe nere a lordschepe 
is to kyngdom 
and þe ferþere fro tyrantdise, 
þe better it is. 
And we wollen rekene þe workes of eiþer 
and discreuen cautels of eyþer. 
For contraries isette nyƷ togeders 
ben þe bettere iknowe, 
þe workes of a kyng ben iknowe for best Ʒif þe contrarie workes of a tyraunt ben declared worst. 
And it is best iknowe 
þat kynges scholde forsake tiraundise, 
for þe worste is more to forsakynge 
and þe best is most to folowyng. Chapter XII Wittes of men ben [so] inclined to euel 
þat it is ful good and profitable [in] 
þe wey of ‡ maners 
and þewes to declare by manye weyes 
and to preue 
by manye resouns 
þat euel and vices ben iuel and vile of hemself 
and to forsakyng, 
so who þat is not inclined by oon wey may be brouƷt 
in by anoþer 
to forsake euel. 
And after þat we hauen declared þat tiraundise 
is most to forsakynge of kynges and princes, 
we wollen preue þat kynges and princes 
sch|olde be most besiliche ware 
þat þei become not tirauntes 
for al corupcioun and wrong 
in oþere principates 
is holiche igadred in tyraundise. 
And as it is declared tofore, 
þ[r]e principatees ben good and þre euel. 
For it was iseid 
þat Ʒif oon is lord 
for þe comyn profit, 
þe principate is riƷtful and is icleped regnum, a regne; 
and Ʒif on is lord 
for his owne profit, 
þe principate is euel 
and is icleped [tyraundise. 
And Ʒif fewe ben lordes 
for þei ben vertuous, 
þe principate is riƷtful 
and is icleped aristocracia 
oþer principate of good men. 
And Ʒif þei ben lordes 
not for þei ben good 
but for þei ben riche, 
þe principate is euel 
and is icleped] elegarchia. 
And Ʒif al þe puple haþ þe lordschipe 
and desireth þe profit of al, 
boþe riche and of oþere, 
þe principate is riƷtful; 
and Ʒif þe puple doþ tiraundise 
and ouersetteþ riche men þe principate 
is euel and is icleped democracia, 
and is to menyng wikkede 
and euele principate of þe puple. 
Þanne tyraundise and wikked principate 
of riche men 
and euel lordschipe of þe puple 
ben euel principates 
and euele rewelynges, 
but tiraundise is þe worste principate. 
For as þe philosofer preueþ, 
v Poleticorum, 
al þe euel þat is in euel principate 
of riche men oþer 
in euel lordschipe of þe puple 
is hoolliche igedred in tyraundyse. 
And þat is declared in þis wise. 
For Ʒif riche men hauen lordschipe wrongfulliche, 
as it longeþ to þis doynge, 
þei desiren þre: moneye, lordliche likynge, 
and warde of body. 
Þei desiren moneye, 
for eche prince desireþ echyng of þyng 
by þe whiche he is prince. 
Þanne Ʒif a man is prince 
for he is good and vertuous, 
he desireth bettere workes 
for to be 
þe betre and þe more vertuous; 
but Ʒif he is prince 
for he is riche, 
þat he may þe bettere be prince 
þei desiren echyng and gaderynge of richesse. 
Wherfore Ʒif riche men ben | wron[g]fulliche lordes, 
þei ben not princes 
for þei ben goode 
but for þei ben riche, 
and al here entent is to gaderi money. 
Also riche men 
þat ben wrongfulliche princes desiren bodiliche likynge 
and sencible lust. 
For Ʒif a man wol ouƷt for a certeyn cause, 
þei wol more þe cause – as Ʒif a man wol haue a drenche 
for to haue heele, 
he desireþ more þe heele 
þan þe drynche. 
Þanne for comynliche men 
and nameliche men 
of euel wil ordeynen money 
and richesse 
to bodilich likynge 
and to sencible lust, 
it folweþ þat riche men 
þat ben wrongfulliche lordes 
and desiren not þe comyn profit 
but money desireþ bodilich likynge. 
Þe þridde, riche men þat ben princes in þat wise 
ben most besy aboute kepyng of þe bodye. 
For no man forsakeþ þe comyn profit and desireþ moneye and likyng 
but he greue þe puple 
in manye manere wise, 
for suche oon pileþ þe citeseyns 
for to haue moneye; 
and for to haue likynge, 
he doþ þe citeseyns wrong 
and despit in wyues and douƷtres. 
Þanne he knoweþ 
þat he is ihated among þe puple and tristeþ not to hem 
and is most besi to kepe þe body. 
And al suche euel doynge in principate, 
þat is to say lordschip 
þat is in euel principate of riche men, 
is igedred in to tyraundise. 
For as it is iseid tofore, 
a tiraunt desireþ 
not þe comyn profit but moneye. 
Also he desireþ not werschepful good 
but likynge good. 
Þe þridde, 
a tyraunt is most besy 
aboute warde of his bodi, 
for he knoweþ 
þat þei hauen igreued many men. 
And it is irad of a tiraunt 
þat was al day iblamed of his | owne brother 
for he was alway elynge and heuy 
and schewede neuere glad chere. 
And þis tyraunt wolde make his broþer 
knowe þe cause 
and let strype hym naked and honge ouer his heed 
a wel scherp swerd 
by a wel smale þreed 
and made men stonde aboute hym 
with alblastres ibend and quarelles þerinne. 
And whanne his brother 
was swyþe sore aferd 
and dradde sore þe swerde 
þat heng ouer his heed 
and þe alblastres 
þat were ibent aboute hym, 
þanne þe tiraund seide, 
“Broþer, 
be glad and schew good 
cheere.” And he seide 
þat he myƷte not 
for he was in so greet perile. 
“Ne,” iquod þe tyraunt, 
“may I be glad, 
for I am in more peril; 
forl hauegreued men 
in so manye manere wise 
þat alwey I drede þe 
deþ.” Þanne it is ful spedful 
to a kyng to be war 
þat he bycome not a tyraunt, 
for tyrauntes leesen þe lif withoute ende and hauen þerto vnneþe oon good day in þis world; 
for þei knowen þat þei ben alwey in perel. 
Also tyrauntes hauen not so moche moneye as verrey kynges, 
for hem nedede to spende moche in veyn. 
And also verrey kynges ben lordes by loue 
and hauen more good by loue 
þan tyrauntes hauen 
by spoylynge of þe puple. 
For we hauen iknowe tyrantes 
þat hauen ileued 
in more desese and nede þan verrey kynges. 
Þanne tyrauntes hauen not so moche bodiliche likynge as verrey kynges. 
For to haue manye frendes 
and be loued of þe puple 
is most likyng, 
and trist in no man 
and trowe 
to be hated of þe puple 
is most sorweful, 
þanne a tyraunt is priued of most likyng 
for þei knowen 
þat he is hated of þe puple. 
Hit | is iknowe 
þat it nedeþ 
to be waar of tiraundise for þe euele 
of an euel principate 
and [a principate of riche men 
is igedred þerinne. 
Þanne it is to knowe 
þat it nedeþ to be waar of þe] eueles of euel prin- cipate of puple igedred þerinne. 
For whanne þe puple hauen principate wickedliche, 
þei desiren not to saue eche man 
in his owne estaat, 
but þey fonden to ouersette gentil men 
and noble 
and so doþ a tyraunt. 
For as it is declared tofore, 
he fondeþ wiþ al his myƷt 
to ouersette excellent men 
and to destroye and slee riche men, gentle and noble. 
Þanne it is most nedful to kynges 
to be war of tyrandise 
in whiche ben so manye euele doynges igadered. f. 141r 35 40 Chapter XIII 
For we make þis book for lore of kynges and of princes 
þat þei mowe riƷtfulliche and streigt rewle þe puple 
þat is vnder hem, 
for leuyng riƷtful rewelyng is ido tiraundise 
and wrong to sogettes 
and not desire þe comyn profit. 
ÞeiƷ we haue declared 
by manye weyes by þynges 
þat ben iseid 
þat it is euel 
and perelous 
to a kyng 
to do tiraundise 
and rewle not þe puple ariƷt, 
Ʒut it slewtheþ vs not to brynge newe resouns 
to preue þe same. 
And we wollen declare in þis chapitre 
þat for manye causes sogettes arisen aƷenst tirauntes, 
and for tyrauntes lif was ful perelous 
and leuynge of riƷtful rewelyng, 
þerfore kynges scholde besiliche studie 
þat þei forsake not riƷtful rewelynge 
noþer do tyraundise. 
And, v Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer rekeneþ sex causes 
whi sogettes risen aƷenst tyrauntes. 
Þe firste is for drede. 
For manye ben feynt hertede, 
and whanne þei dreden to moche and trowen 
not to scape 
and ben in | wanhope, 
a‡ reseþ þerfore in oþere men 
and ben imaad bolde men and hardye. 
Þerfore it is iseid in a prouerbe 
þat he þat chaseþ to swyþe a ferful man maken hem hardy. 
And so oþere bestes comonliche dreden man; 
and but þei trowede 
þat man wolde do hem harm, 
þei wolde selde oþer neuere rese on man. 
Þan comonlich for drede bestes liggen 
in awayte on man 
and reseþ on hem, 
and ofte in þis wise sogettes arisen aƷenst þe tyrant and sleeþ 
hym dredyng 
þat he wol do hem harme. 
Þe seconde cause 
wherfore sogettes risen aƷenst þe tiraunt is for to be wroke of þe wrong 
þat he doþ hem, 
for it is kyndeliche to desire wreche. 
Þerfore Omerus seide 
þat wreche is swettere þan hony, 
for it is desire of peyne for wreche. 
Þanne for it is likynge 
in þat wise to desire wreche, 
manye arysen aƷenste a tyraunt and reseþ on hym som tyme for strong wrathe 
to be wroke of wronges 
þat he doþ. 
Þe þridde, 
som men arisen aƷenst a tyraunt 
and sleeth hym som tyme, 
for comynliche tyrauntes don þynges 
wherfore þei ben despised. 
For þei desiren not þe comyn profit 
but bodilich likynge, 
comynliche þei ben not sobre but glotons 
and not chaast but lechours 
and ben þerfore despised 
and sone men risen on hem. 
Here of we hauen ensaumple as þe philosofer reherseth, v Poleticorum, 
of oon Sardanapallus 
and of anoþer Dionysius. 
For Sardanapallus forsook þe comyn profit 
and Ʒaf hym al to lecherie. 
And a certeyn duk despisede hym 
for his bestial lif 
and resede on hym | and sclow hym. 
And so Dionisius 
was a tyrant 
and tolde more pris of glotonye þanne of þe comyn profit 
and was despised of sogetes, 
for he was as þei he were alwey dronke. 
And oon Dyon seiƷ hym 
as it were dronke alwey 
and hadde despit of hym 
and roos aƷenst hym. 30 35 f. 141v 40 Þe ferþe, 
men risen aöenst a tyraunt for to haue worschep and wyn- nynge. 
For worschep and honour 
is acounted most good 
among out- ward good, manye, seynge þat a tyrant loue 
[onliche his owne honour 
and worschep and honour 
not his sogettes and loue] 
not þe comyne profit and desireþ 
to haue honour and worschep 
as þei seen 
þat þe tiraunt haþ, 
a reseþ on hym and sleeþ hym. 
Also manye men acounteþ money most good, 
and seeþ þat þe tiraunt desireþ 
not but his owne wynyng and gaderyng of moneye and reseþ 
on hym and takeþ his tresour. 
Þerfore, v Poleticorum, 
it is iseid 
þat som men reseþ 
on tirauntes seyng þat þei hauen greet wynnynge and werschep. 
Þe fifþe, 
som men arisen aƷenst tirauntes 
not for to haue þe principate 
but for to be holde men of singuler dedes. 
For som men wolde haue 
a greet name and doþ 
þerfore som wonderful and singuler dede. 
And for þei acounten risynge aƷenste a tyraunt dredful 
and wonderful to þe puple, 
a‡ riseþ þerfore aƷenst hym. 
But as þe philosofer meneþ, 
suche þat risen aƷenst a tiraunt for þis cause ben ful fewe; 
for it nedeþ to suppose þat þe[i] recchen not to be saued. 
Þe sexte, 
som men arisen aƷenste tyrauntes and sleeþ 
hem for to deliuere 
þe contreye of wrong 
þat þei doun. 
For þese causes men risen aƷenst a tiraunt. 
Þanne for no risynge scholde be aƷenst a kyng 
and for a kyng 
scholde not 
al|wey drede to be slayn of his sogettes, 
þei scholde most besiliche be waar 
þat he bycome not a tyrant. 
For Ʒif he doþ sogettes non wrong, 
he is continent and sobre and lyueþ not bestial lyf þat is to despisyng; 
he werschepeþ gentel men 
and oþere þat ben in þe regne as heere astaat axeþ; 
þei spoylen hem not noþer ouersetten hem, 
but he bereþ hym 
in alle thinges not as a tyraunt 
but as a verrey kyng; 
and makeþ al men þat ben in þe regne louye hym 
and bynemen hem 
al malice and cause 
whi þei scholde rise aƷenste hym. Chapter XIV 
TheyƷ we haue itauƷt kynges and princes 
in manye chapitres tofore 
þat þei do not tyrandise 
but þat þei rewle here puple ariƷt, 
Ʒut in þis chapitre we wol brynge forþ 
oþere resons to preue þat Ʒif kynges de- siren 
þat here lordschepe dure, 
þei scholde be bysyliche waar þat þei bicome not tyrauntes. 
For tyraundise and euel principate 
is destroyed 
in mo diuers maneres þan a riƷtful principate of a verrey kyng. 
And, v Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer rekeneþ 
þre maners of destroynge of tyrauntes, 
and seith þat tyraundise destroyeþ [itself, 
and on tyraundise destroyeþ] anoþer, 
and a regne destroyeþ t[i]raundise. 
Tiraundise destroyeþ itself. 
For as it is iseid tofore, 
euel destroyeth itself; 
and Ʒif it is hool, 
it may not be suffred. 
And for wykkednesse 
and euel þat is igadred in tyrantdise 
it may not longe dure. 
Þerfore it is iseid in Poleticis 
þat þe grettere þe tyraundise is, 
þe lasse tyme it dureþ, 
for riƷtwisnesse saueþ citees and principate. 
Wherfore whanne riƷtwisnesse is forsake, 
a wey is imaade 
to destroye þat principate. 
Þanne þe more a polocie and ordenaunce forsakeþ riƷtwisnesse, 
þe sonere 5 of it|self it is destroyed. 
Þanne Ʒif kynges and princes wol 
þat here lordschepe dure, 
þei scholde be bisiliche war 
þat þei forsake not riƷtwisnesse noþer go out of þe wey noþer bycome tyrauntes. 
And Ʒif it happeþ in eny wise 
þat þei doun tirauntdise, 
þei mote abate tiraundise with al here myƷt. 
For þe lasse þe tyraundise is, 
þe more durable is þe principate. 
40 5 f. 142r 10 [Þe seconde], 
on tiraundise destroyeþ 
anoþer þat is contrarie þerto; 
for þei good be not contrarie to good 
for it is good in [on] wise, 
Ʒut euel may be contrarie to euel 
for euel is in many maner wise. 
For a man may hit þe mark 
but in on maner wise, 
and þerfore þerinne is noon euel noþer contrarienesse. 
But he may fayle of þe mark 
in manye maner wise; 
wherfore faylynges may be contrarie, 
as Ʒif þe schot is to long oþer to schort. 
And so a schot ouer þe marke 
is contrarie to a schot 
þat comeþ 
not fulliche to þe marke, 
and a schot to fere in þe on side 
is contrarie to a schot in þe oþer side. 
And so in oure purpos 
oo riƷtful principate 
is not contrarie to anoþer riƷtful principate, 
but a wrongful principate 
is contrarie to anoþer principate wrongful. 
Þanne on tyraun- dise 
may be contrarie to anoþer tiraundise and destroye it, 
as tiraundise of þe puple 
is contrarie to tyraundise of an euel prince 
[and on euel prince] is contrarie to þe tirandise of anoþer euel prince. 
For whanne oon prince oþer anoþer 
þat is prince alone doun tyrandise on þe puple, 
[þe puple] 
þat is ouersette wol not be ouer[sette] 
of suche a prince 
[and] wolle rysen aƷenst hym ‡ 
and don tyraundise aƷenste hym 
and putteþ hym out and sleeth hym. 
Þanne is al þe puple imaad 
as þei it were oo tyraunt, 
wherfore | principate and tyraundise of þe puple destroyen tyraundise of a prince. 
And also tyraundise of a prince 
distroyeth tirandise of anoþer prince. 
For ofte on prince is a tirant and riseþ aƷenst another tirant 
and bynemeþ hym his principate. 
Þanne kynges and princes scholde be besiliche iwar 
þat þei do no tyraundise, 
for principate of tyraundise 
is destroyed 
in so manye manere wise. 
Þe þridde, tiraundise is distroyed 
not oonliche by itself 
oþer by oþer tyrandise 
but also by a regne. 
For not onliche euel 
is contrarie to euel, 
but also good is contrarie to euel; 
and <noƷt> onliche a tiraunt 
is contrarie to a tyraunt, 
but also a kyng riseþ 
aƷenst a tyrant Ʒif he seeþ 
þat it is to doynge. 
Þanne a tyraunt 
is in so manye manere periles and his principate is destroyed 
in so manye manere wise. 
And lordschipe of a kyng 
is not in so many perels noþer is distroyed 
in so mani maner wise. 
For þeiƷ a tirant fonde wiþ 
al his myƷt 
to ouersette a verrey kyng, 
Ʒit no verrey kyng [greueþ a verrey kyng]; 
for no good man and vertuous purseweþ 
oþer good men and vertuos 
but saueþ hym and helpeþ 
with al his myƷt. 
For Ʒif enny gode men 
oþer vertuos greuede good men and vertuos 
þan he leueþ 
to be good and vertuos. 
Þanne a kyng scholde be besilich iware of tyrandise leste he fal in to þe forsaide perels. Chapter XV Qvynto Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer toucheþ x þat saueþ polecie, wisdom, and ordinance 
and þat a kyng mote do kepe hymself in his regne 
oþer principate. 
Þe firste, 
he schal not suffre smale trespaces in his regne, 
for [many smale trespasses, 
as þe philosofer seiþ, 
maken oon greet, 
as] many smale costes mfaken] 
thereto oon greet cost. 
For many smale trespasses disposen, 
þat is to say m[a]ken redy, 
to grete trespasse. 
(For þe grettest trespace 
of al is to deffende Godand his lordschipe togrete trespasse.) | He þat reccheþ not of þe leste falleþ litel and litel 
in to þe moste. 
Þanne þe principies scholde be wiþstonde and wronges scholde be forbode þei 
it were for [li]te. 10 f. 142v 15 
Þe seconde þat saueþ policie, wisdome, 
in rewelyng of kynges 
is wel doynge to hem 
þat ben in þe regne, 
bryngynge hem to som principate 
and do hem worschepe and no wrong. 
For as þe philosofer seith 
in Politicis doynge good 
to citeseyns not onliche saueþ riƷtful policie (wisdome), 
but also þerby þe principate 
is þe more durable þei som wrong be medled þerinne. 
Þe þridde, 
for to make hem aferd 
þat ben in policie (wisdome); 
for harme þat is f[e]r 
in dede and niƷ in drede 
saueþ policie (wisdome). 
For citeseyns ben þe more soget and obedient to þe prince Ʒif 
þei dreden harme of straungers, 
for outward werre aleyƷþ inward strif 
and makeþ citeseyns þe more acorded. 
Herof we hauen ensample of þe Romayns. 
For whanne hem failede outward werre, 
þei bygunne to haue werre among hemself. 
And þis cautel is profitable 
onliche to twey pryncipates: 
to a principate [þat] is imade of men 
þat ben ivsed to werre, 
and to a principate 
in þe whiche on bygynneþ newliche to regne. 
For men þat ben ivsed to werre 
and reccheþ 
not of oþere vertues 
but onliche of fortitudo, staleworþnesse, 
ben by þe philosofres, vii Poleticorum, 
ilikned to ire 
þat is cleer and bryƷt 
while it is ivsede | 
and rusteþ Ʒif it be not ivsed. 
Andso [s]oche fiƷtyng men ben obedient to þe prince 
while þei vsen werre, 
and konneþ not haue hemself 
in þew manere Ʒif þei l[e]uen werre. 
Þanne alwey me schal make suche aferd of werre 
and of harme of straungers. Also Ʒif oon bygynneþ 
neweliche to be prince, 
me wol arise sone aƷenst suche a prince. 
Þanne leste citeseyns arise aƷenste þe prince, 
and also for to be þe more acorded 
to be obedient to þe prince, 
me scholde make hem aferd of perels of straungers. 
But Ʒif þe regne haþ longe istonde in pees 
and Ʒif þat lord is kyndelich lord 
so þat it is as it were out of mynde 
whan his forfadres bygonne to regne, 
þan þe forsaide cautel is litel worþ. 
Þe ferþe þat saueþ polecie, wisdome, 
is for to be waar of rysynges and strif of gentil men and noble; 
and þat Ʒeuyng to hem lawes, 
for lawes ben not sone withseide. 
And suche lawes scholde be maad in a regne 
by þe whiche strif of gentil men myƷt be assaied; 
for Ʒif barouns stryuen, 
þan þer ben parties imaad in þe regne, 
and so is a way imaad 
to destroye þe principate of þe kyng. 
Þe fifte is takyng besiliche heede how þei beren hemself 
þat þe kyng 
haþ þe worschepe and avaunsede 
to som greet office 
oþer to som principate. 
For no thing so kepeþ and saueþ polecie as for to avaunse good men and vertuous 
and Ʒeue hem lordschepe and principate. 
Wherfore most sauacioun of polecie, wisdome, 
is Ʒif þe kyng takeþ 
besiliche heede whatm] he avaunceþ and setteþ 
in greet office and dignite: 
and Ʒif þei doun wel, 
make hem grettere lordes; 
and Ʒif þei doun euel, 
make here lordschepe lasse. 
And þei myƷte do so 
Ʒeuele þat þei scholde lese al here lordschepe 
and on caas here lyf also. 
Þe sixte is for | 
to Ʒeue no man 
to swithe gret lordschipe. 
For grete lordschipe of greet goodnesse of fortune corrumpeþ 
comynliche menne hertes 
and maken hem trespasse aƷenst riƷtwisenesse. 
And þis cautel is most profitable touchinge men þe whiche þe kyng haþ not assayed 
and iknowe longe tyme. 
Þerfore it is most nede to be waar þat no man be sodeynliche isette vp in þe gretteste principate. 
Þe seuenþe þat saueþ polecie, wisdome, 
and regne is Ʒif 
þe kyng 
oþer þe prince louede þe comyn profit of þe regne 
and þe polecie (wisdome) 
in þe whiche he is prince. 
For eche man [þat] loueþ 
is besi and dredeþ 
lest eny thyng falle amys 
in þyng þat he loueþ. 
And drede makeþ men to haue good counsaile as it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum. 
For where many counsaills ben, 
þere is greet sauacioun. 
Wherfore Ʒif þe kyng loueþ þe comyn profit of þe regne, 
þe regne schal be saued. 
For dredynge euel þat myƷte falle in þe regne, 
he wol haue manye coun- saylles 
in what wise he may helpe þe comyn profit of þe regne 
and wiþstonde perils 
þat myƷte befalle. 
Þe eiƷtþe þat saueþ þe regne and polecie 
is cyuel myƷt and powere. 
For as it is iseid in Magnis Moralibus, 
riƷtwisnesse saueþ citees and comyntees. 
But riƷtwisnesse in a regne may not be saued but þei þat trespassen 
aƷenst riƷtwisnesse be ponesched by laweful myƷt and powere. 
öif a kyng oþer a prince wol 
saue riƷtwisnesse and ponysche hem 
þat trespassen, 
þei scholde haue manye spies 
to spie and waite dedes of citeseyns, 
where þei hauen þat þei spenden, 
and | how þey mowe Ʒeue rekenynge 
of here liflode. 
For he þat may not Ʒeue suche rekenyng 
it is a tokene 
þat he lyueþ 
by þefte oþer 
by euel gete good. 
And in þis wise he may saue riƷtwisnesse and kepe 
and saue þe regne 
fro euele doers 
and fro men þat trespassen aƷenst riƷtwisnesse. 
Þe nynþe þat saueþ þe regne 
is a good kyng and vertuous. 
For as it is iseid, 
v Poleticorum, 
more vertue nedeþ 
in kepyng of citee 
and regne þan 
in a duk of an oste. 
[For a duk of an oste] 
nedeþ principalliche experience and assay; 
but þe wardeyn of citee 
and of regne 
mot be vertuous and epeikes, 
þat is to menyng passyng riƷtful. 
For suche on schal be 
as it were an half god; 
for as he passeþ 
oþere men in dignite and in myƷt, 
so þey scholde passe hem in goodnesse. 
And þis schal most saue þe regne and polecie 
Ʒif þe kyng is good and vertuous, 
for þanne he loueþ 
most þe comyn profit of þe regne. 
Þe tenþe is þat þe kyng knowe þe polecie 
by þe whiche he is prince 
and what may destroye þat wisdome 
and what may saue it. 
And suche thinges 
may best be iknowe 
by experience and assaye. 
For whanne a man haþ longe assayed 
and iknowe þe nedes of þe regne, 
it may be sone iknowe what saueþ þe good staat of þe regne 
and what destroyeþ it. 
Þanne a kyng scholde ofte byþenke and haue mynde of þynges 
þat were idoun in þe regne in olde tyme 
and how it was irewled in olde tyme 
and how þe good state of þe regne 
was best isaued in olde tyme 
that he may knowe 
how he scholde be prince 
and what destroyeþ oþer saueþ þe regne in þe rewelynge þerof. 
But suche þynges | 
may be knowe þe regne 
may not be reweled ariƷt. Chapter XVI 
It is iseid tofore 
þat foure scholde be knowe in rewelyng 
of a citee – þe prince, 
þe consaile, 
þe Ʒeld halle and þe puple. 
Þanne after þat we hauen by helpe of God termyned of þe prynce 
and distyngwed 
how manye maner principates þer ben, 
and whiche þerof ben riƷtful 
and whiche wrongful, 
and declared þat a regne 
is best principate 
and tiraundise worst principate, 
and declared what is þe office of a kyng 
and what hym nedeþ for to do 
for to rewle his puple ariƷt: 
†þe þridde†, 
we preuede with manye resons 
þat a kyng scholde be bysiliche ware 
þat he bycomeþ not a tyraunt, 
and as it longeþ to þis doynge, 
we hauen itreted 
atte fulle þynges þat scholde be seide touchinge a prince. 
Þanne it is to tretynge of counsaile 
and of þynges 
þat scholde be treted touchynge counsaille. 
But for þe philosofer, iii Ethicorum, 
seiþ þat a man schal take 
consaille not of þynges 
of þe whiche a fool takeþ counsaile 
and a wode man 
bot of þe whiche wise men 
and redye takeþ counsaile, 
þerfore first it is to wetynge 
wherinne counsaille stondeþ and wherof consaile scholde be take leste we as vncunnynge counsaillours 
wolde take consaille of þynges 
in þe whiche stondeþ no counsaille. 
And as it longeþ to þis doynge, 
we may touche sexe 
þat falleþ not vnder consaile. First, al þyng þat is inmutable 
and may not chaunge 
is out of oure consaile. 
For we taken consaille 
for to be reweled 
in oure dedes and nedes 
and for to voide euel 
and for | to haue good. 
Þan þynges þat may not ben voided 
and þynges 
þat may not be changed 
falleþ not vnder counsaille. 
Þerfore, iii Ethicorum, 
it is iseid 
þat of euere lastynge þynges and of þynges 
þat may not chaunge 
no man axeþ consaille, 
for no man axeþ consaille of þe dyameter 
þat may not be imeete by þe costa noþer of oþer thinges 
þat may not change. Trevisa: 
for þe menynge herof 
it is to wetynge 
þat in quadrate liche long 
and brood ben foure lynes liche longe. 
And þe foure sides þerof and eche of thilke foure side 
lynes is icleped costa. 
And a lyne idrawe in lengþe 
fro þe oo cornere 
of þe quadrate 
to anoþer comer 
in þe oþer side 
is icleped dyameter, 
and þat diameter is lenger þan costa. 
And it may not be knowe in nombrarie 
in what proporcioun þe dyameter 
is longere þan costa. 
10 15 Þe seconde, also of þynges 
þat meuen alwey 
in on manere wise 
is no counsaille itake, 
for þynges þat meueþ alwey 
in on manere wise 
mot nedes meue in þat wise. 
For of þynges þat ben necessarie and nedful 
is no consail itake; 
but of þynges þat may be indifferentliche come 
oþer not come, 
falle oþer not falle, 
is counsaille itake. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
iii Ethicorum, 
þat of þynges 
þat ben alwey 
in meuynge and meueþ alwey 
in oon manere wise, 
as of þe cours | of þe sonne 
and of risyng of þe sterres, 
no man axeþ counsaille. 
For þei þe sterres meue, 
3ut þei meuen alwey 
and mowe not chaunge here cours for owre workes; 
þerfore of suche doyng 
is no counsaille itake. 
And Ʒif any counsaille schulde be take of suche doyng, 
þat is not by itself, 
be it in so moche 
as it serueþ 
to oure dedes and workes 
for som work of man- kynde 
is best idoo 
in hoot tyme 
and som in cold tyme, 
þanne þe cours of sterres 
þat is in diuers tymes cause of heet and of coold 
may not by hitself 
but by happe falle 
vnder consaille so 
þat we may knowe what workes we scholde do 
and in what tyme. 
Þe þridde, 
by þynges þat fallen <oft> 
and by kynde is non consaile itake. 
Þerfore of rayn 
þat falleþ 
ofte in wynter 
and of hete þat falleþ 
ofte in þe somer 
is no conseille itake, 
for suche doynge is kyndeliche and stondeþ 
not in oure choys noþer in oure workes. 
Þerfore of hem 
is no counsaille itake, 
but in so moche as þei seruen 
in diuerse tymes 
to oure diuerse workes. 
Þanne of suche thinges 
is no counsaille itake, 
as no counsaille is itake 
of þe cours of þe sterres and of oþere suche 
but as þei seruen 
to dedes of mankynde, 
þanne it is wel iseid [in] Etic[is] 
þat of drye weder 
and of rayn 
is no counsaile itake. 
Þe ferþe, 
of þynges 
þat falleþ selde and be fortune 
is non consaile itake. 
For al þat axeþ counsaile wol haue som thing by chois 
and by eleccionand 
by hisowne entent, 
þanneof [þ]ynges 
þat comeþ 
withoute oure entent 
is non consaille itake. 
Þerfore it is iseid [in] Ethic[is] 
of þat þynges 
þat comeþ 
by for[tune] 
is non counsaille itake, 
as of fyndyng of tresour. 
Þe fifte, 
also not of al workes 
Of mankynde is consaile itake; 
for not al workes of mankynde falleþ 
vnder oure consaile noþer chaungeth 
for oure dedes | 
þat is idone byfore 
but specialliche for þyng 
þat cometh afterward. 
Þerfore [in] Ethic[is] it is iseide 
þat noon of þe Lacedemones 
takeþ counsaille 
how þe Citees scholde beste lyue. 
Also noþer Frensche men taken counsaille 
how þe Indes scholde best lyue. 
Þanne þynges þat counsaille scholde be take of ben not inmutable 
noþer vnchangable, 
noþer ben alwey in þe same wise, 
noþer ben of kynde, 
noþer of fortune, 
noþer alle workes of mankynde falleþ vnder consaille. 
Bot me consailleþ 
onliche of dedes 
þat we may do; 
for as it is iseide, 
iii Ethicorum, 
alle men taken consaille of workes 
þat we may do. 
[Þe sixte], 
for noþyng þat we desiren fynaliche to haue 
by oure owne workes fallen vnder counsaile, 
for consaille is not of þe ende 
but of menes to come to þe ende. 
For in counsaille it nedeþ 
to suppose a fynal ende 
þat is fynaliche desired 
and not take counsaille 
þerof but of menes 
by þe whiche we may come to þat ende. 
A fisyciandesireþ fynalliche heele 
and takeþ þerfore no counsaille wheþer he scholde heele 
þe sike oþer no. 
But he takeþ for certayne 
þat þe sike scholde be heled 
and takeþ counsaille of weyes and menes 
by þe whiche þe sike may best be heled. 
Also a rector of a citee and regne takeþ no counsaille wheþer citeseyns scholde haue pees among hem 
and wheþer a regne scholde be in good staat; 
but he takeþ þes for certeyn and knoweth 
and takeþ counsaile 
in what manere it myƷte best be idoo. 
Þanne counsaille 
is itake of þyng 
þat stondeþ 
in owre workes 
and ben not finalliche desired noþer ben as it were fynalle ended 
but as menes to þe ende. | f. 144v 25 30 35 Chapter XVII 
Eche counsaile 
is a certeyne questioun, 
[for] as it is iseid, 
vi Ethicorum, 
he þat takeþ counsaile wel oþer euel axeþ 
som what for to make resons. 
Þerfore eche man 
þat consaileþ axeþ, 
but not aƷenward. 
For as it is iseide, 
iii Ethicorum, 
þei eche consail be a questioun, 
Ʒut not eche questioun is a counsaile. 
For Ʒif consaille is itake 
onliche of thinges 
þat stonden in oure dedes, 
consaille is a questioun not of alle thinges 
but oo[n]liche of doynge and dedes of mankynde. 
Of speculatif thinges 
and of kynde of thinges 
and of euere lastynge thinges 
may be manye questions, 
but suche questions 
ben not icleped consailes. Treuysa: cours of sterres and planettes 
and of oþere thinges of kynde 
þat may not chaunge ben icleped speculabilia; 
doynge and dedes of mankynde 
ben icleped agibilia. 
Hit is declared what is counsaile, 
for counsaile is a questioun of doynge 
and dedes of mankynde. 
And it is to wetynge 
in what wise consaile scholde be itake 
and what maner doyng we scholde haue þerinne. 
And as it longeþ to þis doynge for to wite 
how counsaile scholde be take, 
sex mot be knowe. 
Þe firste is þe more 
a þyng is in certeyn, 
þe lasse it nedeþ to haue counsaile þerof; 
and Ʒif it is al in certeyne, 
þanne nedeþ no counsaille. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
iii Ethicorum, 
þat of certayn workes of lore is no counsaille; 
as of lettres þe writere takeþ no counsail 
but he be al vnkunnynge 
how þey scholde write þe letters, 
for he knoweþ 
þat wel by craft of writynge. 
Þanne counsaille 
is itake of þynges þat we may do 
and ben not al certeyn 
how þei scholde be do; 
þerfore we | douten and taken counsaille þerof. 
And it is ivsed in consaille takynge 
þat whan eny nede of þe regne [is] ipurposed, 
by þe mo weyes it may be sped 
and þe lees certeyne weyes it hath, 
þe more it nedeþ to take counsaile 
for to chese þe beste of þylke weyes. 
Þe seconde, 
it is to knowynge 
þat in consaille we scholde not axe consaile 
of al smale thinges 
but of grete thinges. 
For as is iseid tofore 
þat drede makeþ men take counsaille, 
þanne it semeþ 
þat he þat takeþ counsaile dredeþ and douteþ leste he faile 
by som happe of þe beste good 
oþer leste he haue som damage oþer euel. 
Þanne consaile scholde not be take of ful smale thinges 
of þe whiche comeþ 
but litel good 
oþer lette of litel harme. 
Þanne in counsaile 
þe manere scholde be knowe 
þat we scholde take consaile of grete thinges. 
Þe þridde, 
whanne we wolle take counsaile, 
we schal take oþere men to vs 
and trete þe mater among hem. 
For þey a man myƷte 
of his owne wit fynde weyes and maners to do wel and wiseliche in certeyne dedes, 
Ʒit he is vnwise 
þat tristeþ 
al to his owne witt 
[and] he wol not huyre menynge of oþere men. 
For in consailles þis is a greet wisdome 
for to trete wiþ oþere men 
þat is to doynge, 
and þis may be declared 
by twey weyes. 
For as it is iseide tofore, 
counsaile scholde be of grete thinges; 
and in suche þynges eche man scholde clepe oþere men 
to counsaile wetynge 
þat manye men mowe knowe moo þynges þan on man may knowe. 
Wherfore it is iseid, 
iii Ethicorum, þat we taken counsaillours 
in grete thinges, 
as it were †vntrowynge† 
þat we be not | siffisaunt to deme ariƷt. 
Also þe same is declared for consaile 
is of particular doynge, 
and þerinne experience is moche worth. 
For as it is iseid, 
primo Methaphisicorum, 
in suche doynges he þat is expert 
and haþ asayed doþ more profit 
þanne a craftes man. 
Þanne for manye men ben more expert 
and hauen more assaied 
þan on man alone, 
to suche doyng oþere men schulde be cleped 
þat þe beste wey may be chose 
by here counsaille. 
And what counsaillours scholde be cleped it schal be declared in þe processe. 35 40 f.145r 5 Þe ferþe, 
it is to wetynge 
what is iseid in counsaille 
scholde be prevey. 
For manye nedes ben ilett 
by wriyng and tellyng out of counsaille. 
And on caas counsaille 
haþ þerfore þis name consilium, 
for som men wolde mene þat concilium 
is al oon 
for in counsaille 
many sitteþ togeders. 
But on caas we may bettere saye 
þat þis name consilium 
is componed of con þat is to menyng togeders, 
and of silio, siles, 
þat is to menynge be stille in scilence. 
So þat consilium þat is consaille scholde 
be what manye men knowen 
and ben stille and spekeþ not þerof. 
And in consaile þis doynge scholde be most iholde, 
and nameliche whan comune 
nedes and doynge of þe regne ben itreted, 
so þat eche consaillour forsakeþ 
þe doynge of singuler profit 
and haue eyƷe onliche 
to þe comyn profit. 
And what is iseide 
in suche counsaille scholde be preuey 
for profit 
of þe regne scholde not be lett. 
For among þe Romayns trouþe of consaillours 
eched þe empire and þe lordschipe, 
for þei were so preuei 
þat al þat þei herde was 
as preuey as thei had neuer iherd. 
Þerof | Valerius Maximus, 
ii libro De Factis Memorialibus, 
capitulo De Institutis Antiquis, 
preyseþ þe consaillours of Rome 
and seiþ 
þat þe preuey consistorie 
of þe empire 
was trewe and hiƷ and iwarded wiþ stille and preuey helfulnesse; 
and þei þat come in to þe †ligt† 
þerof forsoke priuat loue and louede so þe comyne profit so 
þat I schal not seye 
þat [n]oon 
but þat oon herde trowynge 
þat manye men hurde. 
Þe fifte, 
in counsaile it is to wetynge 
þat me scholde not speke plesynge wordes 
but sothe and trewe. 
For whanne flaterers fonden to plese þe kyng oþer prince, 
þei sparen þe sothe and trewþe 
and speken flateryng wordes and putten al þe principate and regne in peril. 
Þerfore a wis man 
þat heet Aristides seide þat counsailours 
scholde haue twey condiciouns so þat þei scholde not be playne 
and telle out counsaille, 
noþer flaterers and more charge 
to speke plesynge wordes 
þan soþe wordes and trewe. 
Also as þe philosofer reherseth, 
iii Rethoricorum, 
a poet þat heet Alexander seyƷ in counsailles 
þat oon was preuey and soþ seggere 
and preysede hym and saide, 
“þis is a 
counsaillour,” as þeiƷ he wol mene in comparisoun to hym 
þe oþere scholde not be cleped counsaillours 
but on caas flaterers. 
Þe sexte is þat in counsaille 
it is to doynge 
þat men take counsaile to do 
in dede anoon 
as it is icounsailled 
Ʒif it is good tyme. 
For Ʒif it is good tyme of doyng, 
Ʒif we wille to do ariƷt 
a certeyne dede 
and we doun it nouƷt, 
þat is for we knowen not 
whether it be spedful oþer no. 
Þanne it is wel idoo 
to trete besiliche 
a grete dede wheþer | 
it be to doynge oþer no. 
But after þat it is wel iknowe 
by longe consaile what is to doynge, 
it scholde be doun anoon Ʒif þer is good tyme of doynge. 
Þanne it is wel iseid, 
vi Ethicorum, 
þat we counsaillen longe tyme and worcheþ anoun, 
and þat it nedeþ 
to consaille slowliche and to do 
and werche swyftliche 
as þe consaille demeþ. f. 145v 5 Chapter XVIII 
Alle þat he scholde haue in [se]mynge 
þat makeþ good euydences and persuasions 
and is wel itrowed, 
a good counsaillour scholde haue in dede. 
For by cause a man makeþ good euedences in counsailes 
and is itrowed, 
for he is iholde a good counsaillour 
to make good euedences. 
But þeiƷ a man be holde good 
and wel to trowynge, 
it nedeþ not 
þat he be suche on in dede; 
but it is inow 
þat he be holde suche on, 
for man demeþ what he knoweþ outward 
by þe skylful euedences. 
Þerfore man haþ suffisaunt euydence 
and fey by oon 
þat is wel to trowynge 
Ʒif he holde hym a good counsaillour. 
But for to be a good consaillour 
it is not inow to seme suche oon, 
but it nedeþ þat he be suche oon in dede. 
Þanne it is wel iseid 
þat eche þat makeþ euedences 
and hath a good consaillour 
in semyng mot haue 
suche oon in dede. 
Wherfore Ʒif we wolle knowe what consaillours 
a kyng scholde haue 
and what thinges 
and how manye ben nedful in counsaille, 
it is spedful to knowe 
in how manye manere wise persuasions 
and euedences 
ben imaad to meue men to trowe wordes 
þat þei hyren. 
And þes ben þre 
as in eche speche mote be þre – þei þat speken, 
and þe auditoure | 
to wham þey speken, 
and þe þyng of þe which þe speche is. 
And first, it may be þat þe auditour haþ euydence 
and is imeued to trowe wordes 
þat he ahireþ 
by cause of hym þat spekeþ, 
and þat is ⌜Ʒif⌝⌜he⌝ 
þat aspekeþ is good oþere iholde good. 
For good men ben itrowed 
þouƷ þei conne make non resouns. 
But suche fey and trowyng comeþ 
of hym þat spekeþ, 
for by cause þat men ben good 
and wollen not lye 
þei ben sone itrowed. 
Þe seconde, 
auditours mowe by hemself 
haue suche fey and trowyng 
and þat may be Ʒif he 
þat spekeþ 
is goodliche and frend, 
and nameliche iholde goodliche and frend. 
For as men ben comynlich disceyued of hemself, 
trowyng þat þei ben more worthi 
and more wis þan þei ben, 
and comynliche in nedes 
and causes men trowen 
þat þei seen more 
þan þei seen 
and þat þei speken more to purpos þan þei don, 
so for a man is iholde a frend, 
comynliche men ben disceyued of frendes. 
For as it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
louynge and hatynge demeþ diuerseliche, 
for comynliche we demen good of dedes of frendes 
and euel dedes of enemyes. 
For we ben passionate touchinge oure frendes as we ben touchinge vsself so þat we trowen 
þat þei ben bettere and more worth 
þan þei ben. 
Wherfore Ʒif auditours trowen goodliche men and frendes and men 
þat ben suche iholde, 
suche trowynge comeþ 
of þe silf auditours 
to þe whiche þe speche is imaad 
and ben passionate of hemself 
and inclined to trowe hem 
þat ben frendes. 
Þe þridde trowynge comeþ 
of þe selue thinges, 
and þat is Ʒif þe spekere is wise oþer iholde wis, 
for a | wise man knoweþ þe thinges and nedes and causes. 
For it is iseid, primo Ethicorum, 
þat eche man demeþ wel of þynges 
þat he knoweþ. 
Þanne of nedes and þynges 
þat a wise man spekeþ of comeþ fey and trowynge, 
and þis trowynge and persuasioun is of itself. 
For Ʒif a man makeþ hymself wel itrowed 
and makeþ good euydence by hymself, 
it comeþ of þynges and nedes of þe whiche he spekeþ and cunnynge of mankynde of resouns and of argumentes 
by þe whiche auditours 
ben imeued to trowynge. 
And for wise men conneþ do so 
and it is itrowed 
þat þei þat ben iholde wise cunneþ do so, 
þerfore Ʒif a man makeþ trowynge by thinges þat þei speken of, 
[oþer he] mot be wise 
oþer iholde wis. f. 146r 10 15 Þanne eche þat makeþ wel euedences 
and is wel itrowed 
mot be good oþer 
a frend oþer wise 
þeiƷ he be not so in dede 
but iholde such oon. 
Also it is iseid 
þat þynges 
þat he þat makeþ good euedences 
and is itrowed scholde haue in semynge, 
a good consaillour scholde haue in dede. 
It is declared atte fulle 
what manere consaillours 
a kyng scholde haue, 
for þei scholde haue consaillours 
þat ben good frendes and wise. 
For Ʒif þei ben good, a ‡ lyeth not 
by cause of hemsilf, 
for good men haten al euel and al þat is to hatynge; 
for as it is seid, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
lesynge is euel of itself 
and is to hatynge. 
Þe seconde, 
consaillours scholde not be oonliche good 
but also frendes; 
and so not onliche ‡ 
þei lyen not 
by cause of hem 
þat spekeþ and Ʒeueþ counsaille, 
[but also by cause of hym þat þei spekeþ 
to and Ʒeueþ counsaille]: 
for frendes consailleþ 
frendes good and trowþ | 
wiþ al here myƷt. 
Þe þridde, 
consaillours schulde be wyse, 
for þei lien not of thinges 
þat þei speken 
of but knowen þe nedes 
þat ben to doynge and weten how it scholde be do. 
Þanne þes þre ben nedful in counsailours: goodnesse, frendschepe [and wisdome]. 
For to counsaile ariƷt, 
as it is iseid, 
þei scholde be good frendes and wise. Chapter XIX Ʒif þe philosofres wordes, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
ben iknowe, 
of fyue men taken counsaile: 
of rente and payementes, 
of food, of warde of citees, 
of pees and of werre, 
of Ʒeuynge of lawe. 
Touchynge this fyue, 
consaillours mot be wis and cunnynge. 
For first consaille is of paiement and fongyng 
in þe whiche tweyne most be knowe. First, 
þat þe kyng take no payementes 
wrongfulliche of his citeseyns, 
for it is ipreuede tofore 
þat a kyng scholde be good and vertuous and avaunce and werschepe hem 
þat ben in þe regne and loue policye. 
And þat may not be Ʒif 
þei bynemen hem here good wrongfulliche. 
Also it is to wetynge and to be waar 
þat þe kyng be not deceyued 
in payment and fongynge. 
For it is spedful 
þat þe kynges counsaille 
saue his rigt wiþ al here myƷt, 
for suche good is iordeyned for þe comyn profit 
and for þe defence of þe regne 
and for þe good astaat þerof. 
Þanne consaillours scholde knowe rentes, prouentes, profites, 
and paymentes of þe regne 
þat scholde come to þe kyng, 
what payement and how greet, 
so þat Ʒif eny payement 
is to moche and wrongfulliche itake, 
it scholde be abated; 
and Ʒif it is to litel 
and | to scarse, 
it sholde be ieched 
and imaad more. 
Þe seconde consaile is of foode. 
For to knowe Ʒif a citee oþer a regne 
þat haþ a prince 
and a rector be sufñsaunt to itself in vitailes 
and in seruantes to suffisaunt leuynge, 
me scholde take heede 
what store of vittailles 
is in þe regne 
and in eche citee þerof, 
and how moche may be b[r]ouƷt þerto, 
and how and by wham 
it may be brouƷt þerto, 
so þat goode counsaile 
and good ordinaunce 
may be maad in þis mater. 
Hit is not to takyng litel heede of vitailles 
so þat eche citee haue suffisaunt lyuynge, 
for elles it were not a cite. 
And also in suche thinges 
þat ben suffisaunt to þe lif scholde be chaunge 
and byggynge and sellynge. 
Also it is to takynge hede of mesures and wiƷtes of sellers; 
and whanne it is spedful, 
þe prise of sellynge scholde be taxed Ʒif sellers 
wolde selle derrere 
þan þei scholde. 
Þe þridde counsaille scholde be of warde 
and kepynge of citee and of regne, 
and þat in twey maner wise. 
For þe firste nedeþ warde and kepynge 
þat strif and risyng 
and euel doynge arise not þerinne. 
Þerfore it is besiliche 
to takynge heede 
whiche citeseyns 
ben iholde goode and whiche euel, 
so þat þe euel scholde be besiliche aspied and awayted. 
And Ʒif þei ben itake 
wiþ euel doynge, 
þei scholde be iponysched oþer ido to deþe; 
for kynges and princes scholde not suffry passyng euel doers alyue. 
Also þe place scholde be aspied 
in þe whiche þei vsen most to do harme. 
For as som men don more harme þan oþere, 
so som places ben more accordyng 
to do harme inne þan oþere. 
As in a citee sum stretes | 
ben more suspecte þan oþere 
and þerinne euele doers 
mowe betere be hid 
and ascape hym þat pursewen hem. 
Also withoute citees ben wodes 
and places with schadewes more accordyng þan oþere to do harm inne. 
Þanne counsaille scholde be take 
þat suche place scholde be wel ikepte. 
Also in kepynge of citee 
and of regne consaile scholde be take not oonliche for citeseyns and for hem 
þat ben in þe regne 
lest oon do oþer wrong, 
but also for straungers. 
For it is to takynge heede 
[Ʒi]f þe regne in eny side 
myƷte be ouersette wiþ enemyes, 
and Ʒif eny cite of þe regne myƷt take harme of enemyes. 
Þerfore straungers 
schold not be maad wardeynes 
noþer kepers of passages, 
of hauenes, 
noþer of stroyte entrees 
noþer of oþer suche place 
by þe whiche straungers and aliens myƷte entre, 
but suche place of entryng scholde be besiliche ikepte and iwarded. 
Þe ferþe counsaile [is of pees and of werre þat] 
is not to takynge of pees 
and of werre [of citeseyns]. 
For pes of citeseyns 
is finalliche desired 
and werre is contrarie þerto, 
and no man of riƷt witte takeþ 
counsail of þe fynal ende for consaile 
is not but of thinges 
þat ben in doute. 
For counsaile is as it were a certeyne questioun 
and as a certeyne proporcioun 
þat is in doute. 
And of þe ende þat is principat- liche desired no man douteþ whether it be to pursewynge oþer no, 
and eche man knoweþ 
þat þe contrarie is to voidynge. 
Þerfore pees of citeseynes scholde be kepte 
and isaued by myƷt and strengthe, 
and here strif and werre scholde be voyded with myƷt and strengthe. 
And herof is no questioun noþer counsaile scholde be take. 
But wheþer | we schul haue pees 
oþer werre wiþ straungers 
it is to doute 
oþer may be doute, 
and þerof counsaile scholde be take. 
And in þis doynge tweyn ben to wetynge; 
first, 
þat neuere wrongful werre be itake. 
For doyng wrong to oþere men and ouersette hem wrongfulliche 
is euel of itself 
and scholde be forsake. 
Þanne Ʒif þe werre semeþ riƷtful, 
it is to takyng hede of myƷt 
and strengthe of þe regne 
oþer citee þat wol werre, 
how greet þe myƷt is 
and how greet helpe may come 
þerto of outward place. 
Also it is to takyng hede of myƷt of aduersaries; 
for as þe philosofer seith, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
we scholde haue pees with goode men 
and with euele men 
we scholde fiƷte oþer not fiƷte. 
Ʒif þei ben strengere þan we so 
þat we mow not withstonde hem 
Ʒif þei mysdoþ vs, it is wisdom 
þat we rise not aƷenst hem 
but we see oure tyme 
whanne we may take wreche of hem. 
Þe fifte of þe whiche consaille scholde be take 
is Ʒeuynge of lawes. 
For as it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
sauacioun of citees stondeþ in lawes, 
for citees and regnes ben isaued by riƷtful lawes. 
For wiþoute riƷtwisnesse may not a regne stonde. 
And kynges scholde knowe how manye manere lordschipes 
þer ben 
and how manye manere principates, 
and what principate is most durable, 
and how þe principate 
in þe whiche a man‡ [is] lorde may be saued and destroyed. 
And chesynge þe beste manere of principate 
þei scholde Ʒeue riƷtíul lawes 
by þe whiche þat principate may be saued. 
And | whiche is þe beste manere of principate 
and what is a kynges office 
and how a kyng scholde kepe and saue hymself 
in his lordschipe 
tofore it is declared. 
Wherfore by thinges 
þat ben iseid 
by help of assaye 
and experience of particuler doynges 
þat ben alway iseie 
in courtis of kyngis and of princes, 
a ‡ rector of a citee and of regne may leme how counsaille scholde be take in Ʒeuynge of lawes 
and what lawes scholde be iƷeue to saue his principate. 
In chapitres þat folwen we thinke to make grete inquisiciouns of lawes 
so þat by thinges 
þat ben iseid and schal be seid soþ and trowþe may be þe betere iknowe. Chapter XX 
For in þe chapitre tofore we hauen itreted of princes 
declarynge what manere man scholde be a prince 
and tretede of counsaile 
what manere men scholde be consaillours 
and of what thinges 
and how manye counsaille scholde be take, 
now by þe ordre 
þat is iset it is to tretynge of þe Ʒeld halle and of dome, 
declaryng how þat doom scholde be Ʒeue, 
and [how] manye manere lawes þer ben, 
and oþere þat longeþ to þis matere. 
But for doom scholde be Ʒeue by lawe oþere 
by free wille oþer by eyþer, 
ar we declare how doom scholde be Ʒeue 
as it is possible, 
we wol declare þat it is possible 
al þynges scholde be demed by lawe 
and ful fewe mow be vppoun fre wille of iuges. 
And þis may be preued 
by foure weyes 
of þe whiche þre ben itouched, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
and þe ferþe is itouched, vi Poleticomm. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For Ʒeuers of lawes ben lees | 
þanne iuges 
þat demen by lawes 
þat ben iƷeue. 
For in eche citee nedeþ to haue a comyn Ʒeld halle 
to þe whiche causes and plee 
þat risen 
in þe citee mot be brouƷt. 
And by lawes þat ben imaad 
in a citee manye citees 
may be reweled. 
And in þe same citee 
in þe whiche lawes ben imaad 
ben moo iuges þan makers of lawes. 
For Ʒif lawes ben riƷtful, 
þei scholde be 
as it were inmutable. 
Wherfore in suche lawes scholde be litel chaungyng oþer none but iuges 
þat demen by þilke lawe deyen and ben corupte. 
Also wiþoute compcioun and deeþ iuges 
ben iput out of here office 
and oþere ibrouƷt in here stede. 
Þanne nameliche in passynge of tyme 
in þe same citee 
nedeþ 
to haue manye iuges, 
for þei ben 
as it were alwey chaunged and renewed. 
But it nedeþ not in þat wise 
haue manye makers of lawes, 
for lawes ben not alwey 
so ichaunged and renewed. 
Wherfore Ʒif makers of lawe 
ben fewere þan iuges, 
for it is esiere 
to fynde fewe wise men þan manye for to dispose alle thinges wiseliche, 
it is spedful 
þat alle thinges be demed by lawe 
as it is possible 
and ful fewe 
by fre avisement and wille of iuges. f.147v 20 25 30 35 
Þe seconde wey is declared in þis wise. 
For it is more esy 
and betere to knowe 
what is riƷtful Ʒif 
it is long tyme 
bysiliche itreted þanne Ʒif it 
nedeþ anon to 5eue centence and doom. 
Also makers of lawes mowe avise hem longe tyme 
and by greet counsaile what lawes þei scholde make. 
But for instaunce of partees iuges scholde not drawe lawes 
along noþer tarye þe partees, 
but spede hem and hauen þerfore | 
not long tyme inowe 
to avise hem 
what is riƷtful 
in suche an ende. 
Panne for me scholde not erre in demynge, 
al þyng scholde be demed by lawes 
as it is possible, 
and fewe by fre avisement 
and wille of iuges. 
Þe þridde wey is declared in þis wise. 
For makers of lawes maken lawes in general 
who þat euere doþ 
so he schal be ponysched so, 
vnwetynge wheþer frend oþer enemy schal do so 
and haue suche a peyne. 
Ʒif he knewe þat a frend scholde do suche a dede, 
on caas þey wolde wiþdrawe þe peyne in demynge; 
and Ʒif he knewe þat an enemy scholde do suche a dede, 
on cas he wolde lenye to þe contrarie 10 
and sette more peyne. 
And now for lawes ben iƷeue onliche in general so 
þat þei þat Ʒeuen þe lawe knowen not in particuler 
what schal befalle, 
a‡ ben þerfore not inclined 
to do wrong 
in demynge for loue noþer for hate. 
But iuges faren not so, 
for here domes ben not of dedes 
þat ben to comyng but of dedes þat ben apassed, 
and not in general 
but in particuler 
and inclined to a certeyn persone. 
And ofte suche thinges 
hauen purpos annexed þerto. 
Þerfore a iuge may sone erre, 
for þei þat louen and haten and taken hede 
of worldeliche profit 
demen not alwey euene. 
Wherfore for doome scholde not be wrong, 
it is good in so moche 
as it is poscible 
þat alle thinges be demed 
by lawe and ful fewe 
by fre avisement and wille of iuges. 
And þe philosofer toucheþ þes þre resons, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
and seith þat it is most riƷtfulliche to deme by lawes 
þat ben isette as forþ as it is possible, 
and to deme wel fewe 
by fre avisement | 
and wil of iuges. First, 
for on oþer fewe wise men 
ben sonnere ifounde þan manye. 
Þe seconde, 
for lawes ben imaad 
by avisement of longe tyme and domes 
ben iƷeue of þynges 
þat risen and sodeynliche. 
And þe þridde is most of alle, 
for lawes ben imaad of thinges 
þat ben to comynge and in general. 
But a parfit iuge demeþ of certeyne thinges 
þat ben apassed oþer present 
and is iloued oþer hated, 
and to eche purpos is ofte som profite annexed. 20 25 f.18r 30 
Þe ferþe wey ‡ to preue þe same may be declared in þis wise. 
For as it schal be declared herafter sum thinges 
mot be demed 
by fre avise- ment and wil of iugis, 
for particular doingis mowe not be rekenid 
at fulle noþer 
al þingis schulde be demid bi lawe, 
naþeles as forþ 
as it is possible 
al þingis schulde be demid 
by fre avisement and wil of iuges. 
For as þe philosofir seyth, sexto Poleticorum, 
þe lasse enemyte is in hem 
þat folwen for þe doom, 
þe sonnere þei scholde haue an ende and execucioun of þe doom. 
Wherfore [for] a iuge demynge mysdoers 
haþ not so greet enemyte 
as þei scholde Ʒif þei demede hem 
by his owne 
fre avisement and wille, 
for þe iuge scholde not be inclined 
for drede of enemyte 
to tarie riƷtful doom 
oþer to spare riƷtful doom, 
as forþ 
as it is poscible al þynges 
scholde be demed by lawe and fewe 
by fre avisement and wille of iuges. 
For a iuge is ful excused 
whan he demeþ by lawe, 
for it semeþ not his doynge 
but he is compelled by þe lawe to Ʒeue suche a doom. Chapter XXI Ivges scholde take heede 
to make suche processe in doom 
so þat angry wordis 
and hote and euil sittingge 
þat 
me|ueþ to wraþþe 
and to hate be forbode in doom. 
For manye þat pleden, 
knowyng þat here cause is nouƷt, 
telleþ not what is ido 
and what is not idoo 
but fonden to meue þe iuge to wrethe 
and to hate aƷenst here 
aduersaries 
and to goodnesse and mercy toward hemself. 
But þat suche wordes 
scholde be forbode 
we may preue by þre weyes. 
Þe firste, 
for suche wordes maken þe iuge erre 
þat nedeþ to be 
as þe rewle in demynge. 
Þe seconde, 
for suche wordes 
bynemen þe ordre of demynge. 
Þe þridde, 
for þei ben inpertinent to þe purpos. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For we schal knowe 
þat a iuge 
in demynge of plee 
for to deme ariƷt scholde be bytwene hem þat pleden, 
as þe tonge demynge of sauours oþer 
as of eche oþer wit demynge of sencible knowynge 
þat longeþ 
þerto scholde be bytweyne sauours 
oþer 
bytweyne sencible propre thinges. 
For a cencible wit is mene proporcioun betwyne sencible thinges 
þat longeþ þerto, 
as þe siƷt is mene proporcioun bytwene thinges 
þat ben iseye 
and þe huyryng betwene thinges 
þat ben ihurd 
and so in oþere. 
And while þe witte 
is not infecte by oon contrarie, 
it Ʒeueth riƷtful doom of cencible thinges 
þat þei felen. 
As while þe tonge 
is not infecte wiþ euel humour, 
it demeþ ariƷt and demeþ 
þat bitter is bitter 
and swete is swete; 
and Ʒif it is infecte wiþ colera oþer wiþ flewme oþer 
with som oþer euel humoure, 
þanne as þei he were not in þe myddel but idrawe to þe on contrarie side, 
it demeþ amys 
and demeþ of swete 
þat it is b[i]tter and aƷeward, 
as it fareþ in sike men 
whanne here | 
taast is infecte. 
So a iuge while he is mene 
bytwene partees 
and as it were an euene rewle 
not inclined 
to þe oon partie, 
he seith þat riƷt is riƷt 
and wrong is wrong. 
And Ʒif þe iuges is inclined 
to þe on partie 
by mercye oþer 
by frend- schipe 
and forsakeþ 
þe oþer partie for wrethe oþer for hate, 
þanne he is as it were a crokede rewle and demen amys. 
And for euel sittynge wordes 
is cause of suche doynge, 
it is al oon to suffre suche wordes 
in doom 
and to make þe rewle crokede. 
Þanne Ʒif it is inconuenyent 
to make þe rewle croked, 
it is inconuenient in doom 
to suffre euele sittynge wordes. 
For as it schal be declared, 
iuges scholde be more inclined to mercy 
þanne to ponyschyng, suffryng; 
and wordes þat meueþ to mercye and goodnesse schulde be more suffred þan wordes 
þat meuen to wrethe and to hate. 
Þe seconde wey to preue 
þat suche wordes 
scholde not be suffred is itake for suche wordes 
mysterneþ þe ordre of demynge, 
for in demyng is a certeyn ordre. 
For þer is som what as it were heyƷest 
and som what as it were mene 
and som what as it were lowest, 
as þe heighest [is] þe lawe oþer þe prince oþer som who þat makeþ þe lawe, 
as mene is þe iuge, 
as þe loweste is he 
þat is acused oþer parties þat pleten, 
þe iuge is mene bytwene makere of lawe 
and hem þat pleden. 
For þe mene scholde haue 
som what of eiþer side, 
þe iuge as mene takeþ som what of eiþer side. 
For of þe makere of lawe he takeþ 
what is riƷtful and nouƷt riƷtful. 
And Ʒif riƷt is iknowe by lawes of hym 
by whoos lawes | 
þe iuge is irewled in demynge, 
he lemeþ what is riƷtful in nedes 
and dedes of mankynde; 
þanne of þe makere of lawes 
þe iuges lemeþ what is rightful, 
and of þe parties he lerneth what is ido 
oþer not idoo. 
And Ʒif he lemede <not> 
of hem what is riƷtful 
(trowthe and good conscience techeth what is riƷtful), 
‡ þat is by accident 
in so moche as þei aleggen lawes 
þat ben imaad by þe makere of lawes. 
Þanne for passionale wordes inclinen to wille and maken som what sum riƷtful 
þat is not riƷtful, 
for passionat men – as men 
þat louen and haten 
and ben glad oþer sory 
– ben not alle idemedin on wise, 
it is al oon tosuffre passionale wordes 
in doom 
and to ouertome þe ordre of demynge. 
For Ʒif it is isuffred, 
þe parties ben imaad makers of lawes 
and isette in þe heiƷeste 20 gree in demynge 
and scholde be in loweste. 
And þere suche ordre is ouerturned, 
for þe partees wiþ suche wordes maken som what sum riƷtful 
þat is not riƷtful; 
and þat is not þe office of þe parties 
but of makeris of lawis. 
For be þe maker of lawis 
oþer bi is lawis 
þe iuge schulde know what is riƷtful 
and what is not riƷtful, 
and not bi þe partees 
þat pleden noþer 
by suche wordes ispoke. 40 5 Þe þridde wey is itake 
for suche wordes 
ben inpertinent to þe purpos 
and ben wiþoute cause. 
For whanne plee is of eny thing 
oþer of beynge, 
no þyng scholde be seide in doom 
but pertinent to þe þyng oþere cause 
þat is ipleted. 
Spekyng of suche wordes 
tofore þe iuge, 
and telle wronges 
þat þe oþer partie 
haþ idoo to þe iuge 
and good 
þat þei hamself 
hauen idoo to þe iuge, 
and mouen þe iuge 
in þis wise to ma|lice toward þe oþer partie 
and to loue toward hymself 
is not to purpos. 
Wherfore suche doynge scholde not be suffred. Chapter XXII 
We may rekene foure 
þat is nedful to iuges 
for to Ʒeue riƷtful domes 35 and trewe. 
Þe firste is auctorite of demynge; 
þe seconde is redinesse of þynges; 
þe þridde, experience and assay of doynges and of dedes; 
þe ferþe, riƷtful wille. 
For as it longeþ to þis doynge, 
in eche plee foure scholde be knowe. 
Þe partees þat pleden; 
þe cause þat is ipleted; 
lawes by þe whiche plee schal be demed; 
and þe makere of þe lawe 
oþer þe princes 
þat Ʒeuen auctorite for to deme. 
And for to deme riƷt it is spedful to iugis 
to take hede of al þes, 
for þe dome schold not be wrongfulliche iƷeue 
and without auctorite, 
noþer vnlaweful, 
noþer fals, 
noþer presumptuous. 
For Ʒif iuges beren hem not wel to the Ʒeuere of þe lawes, 
þanne þey Ʒeuen a wrongful doom 
þat is icleped vsurpate; 
for þei taken more vpoun hem þan þei scholde. 
And þanne iuges beren hem not wel to þe Ʒeuere of lawe 
whanne þei passen here 
auctorite and commyssioun. 
Þe seconde, iuges Ʒeuen a iuel doom 
þat is icleped temerarium 
Ʒif þei beren hemsilf not wel to þe lawes, 
as Ʒif þei ben vnredy in knowynge of lawes; 
for wiþoute knowynge of lawes 
cause may not be demed ariƷt. 
Þe þridde, iuges Ʒeuen an yuel doom 
þat is icleped iniquum Ʒif þei beren not hemself 
wel to þe partees þat pleden. 
For as it is iseid, 
a iuge scholde be as it were 
a riƷtful rewle bytwene twey partees. 
[Wherfore Ʒif suche rewle] 
ben|den forþward þe mene, 
lenynge toward þe oon partie 
for loue and froward 
þe oþere partie for hate, 
þanne þei mote deme wrongfulliche; 
for þanne þe doom comeþ 
not of loue of riƷt 
but of loue 
oþer hate of þe parties. 
Þe iiii, 
Ʒif iuges beren hem not wel to þe nedes and dedes, 
and Ʒif þei be not expert 
in wordes and dedes [of] mankynde, þey wol ‡ Ʒeue doom 
þat is suspecte, 
for som tyme for liƷt suspeccioun 
þei Ʒeuen doom aƷenst oþere men. 
Þanne þe doom is not riƷtful 
but þer by auctorite of demynge, 
cunnynge of lawe, loue of riƷtwisnesse, 
and experience of doynges and dedes. 
For as in cure of bodiliche siknesse 
som tyme he þat is expert doþ more profit þan he þat haþ þe craft 
for þei knowe particuler condicions, 
so in doom of dedes 
and causes som tyme þei þat ben expert doþ more profit þa[n] 
þei þat knowen þe lawe. 
Þanne alle þe forsaide nedeþ to deme ariƷt. 
Þanne it is declared 
what manere iuges of causes 
a kyng scholde haue. 
For þei scholde be meke 
and not passe here 
commynssioun and auctorite, 
wis and kunnynge in lawe, 
and konnynge to applie þe lawes 
to þe plee. 
And þei scholde louye riƷt 
and Ʒeue doom 
not for loue noþer 
for hate of partees, 
but for loue of riƷtwisnesse. 
And þei scholde haue experience 
and assay of doynges 
and dedes 
and knowe particuler doynges 
for to declare causes þe bettre. Chapter XXIII 
As it longeþ to þis doynge we may rekene ten þe whiche 
þe philosofer rekeneþ, primo Rethoricorum, 
to þe whiche a iuge most take heede 
for to spare men | 
and for to be more mylde þan cruel. 
Þe firste is mankynde. 
Þe seconde is þe Ʒeuere of lawe. 
Þe þridde, 
ful knowyng of lawe. 
Þe ferþe is entente 
þat worcheþ. 
Þe fifte, multitude of good workes. 
Þe sixte, lengþe of tyme 
þat is apassed. 
Þe seuenþe, goodnesse passynge malice. 
Þe eiƷte is pacience 
þat is accused. 
Þe nynþe, 
Ʒif he þat trespasseþ 
is able to be amended. 
Þe tenþe is lownesse 
þat trespassen. f. 149v 40 And first, mankynde crieþ 
for myldenesse for hem þat trespassen. 
For mankynde is feble of itself 
and chaungable and inclyned to euel; 
<‡> Ʒif it happeþ 
þat a man trespasse, 
brotelnesse of kynde cryeþ mercye. 
Þerfore it is iseid, primo Rethoricorum, 
þat epie[i]kes haþ mercy of mankynde, 
and he is icleped epy[e]ikes 
þat is aboue riƷt 
oþer aboue riƷtwisnesse. 
Þanne þe philosofer clepeþ hym supra iustum 
þat sparen mankynde, 
for myldenesse scholde be aboue cruelnesse and aboue riƷtwisnesse. 
Þe seconde þat scholde meue a iuge to myldenesse 
is þe Ʒeuere of lawe. 
For on caas þe kyng oþer prince þat Ʒeueþ lawe, 
Ʒif þei knewe þe condicions of hem 
þat trespassen, 
þei wolde haue mercye on hem. 
Wherfore Ʒif þe iuge may knowe 
þat þe makere of lawe wolde despence and spare hym 
þat is gilty, 
þei scholde be more merciable þan cruel. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
þat a iuge scholde take more heede 
to þe makere of lawe þan to lawe. 
Þe þridde þat meueþ to myldenesse 
is mylde vnderstondynge of lawes. 
For to fere mysdoers, 
lawes conteynen þe | more cruelnesse. 
Wherfore Ʒif wordes of lawe be þe more cruel 
for to fere euel doers, 
it is semeliche 
þat greet payne be moderat 
by mylde vnderstondyng. 
Þanne þis is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
þat a iuge schulde take heede 
not onliche of þe workes 
of þe lawe 
but to þe vnderstondynge of þe lawe. 
Þe ferþe is intencioun of hym 
þat doþ þe dede. 
For þei þe dede of þe whiche a man is accused be of þe kynde of euel dedes, 
Ʒit on caas his entencioun was not euel; 
oþer Ʒif it was euel, 
on caas it was not so euel 
as it semede by þe dede; 
oþer for dedes 
þat ben in doute scholde be demed 
to þe bettere side – Ʒif þe iuge may knowe in eny wise 
þat he þat trespassede trespasede 
not by his owne 
fre wil but by vnkunnynge oþer by myshappe, 
þanne þe iuge scholde be inclyned to myldenesse. 
Þerfore it is iseide, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
þat a iuge scholde take hede not onliche to þe dede 
but also to þe eleccioun. 
Þe fifþe þat meuen to mercye 
is multitude of goode dedes. 
For on caas he þat haþ now 
itrespassed haþ 
tofore hond ido manye goode dedes, 
þanne a iuge scholde not so moch take heede to a party, 
as to þis particuler doyng 
in þe whiche on haþ itrespassed, 
as to þe hoole, 
as to many goode dedes 
þat he dede tofore honde. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
þat a iuge scholde not take heede 
to þe partees 
as to al þe hoole. 
Þe sexte is lengþe of tyme apassed. 
For it may be 
þat on doþ 
manye goode dedes 
in litel tyme, 
þanne tweyne thingis bene 
þat schold meue a kyng and eche oþer lord 
to louye his sogette – 
oþer for he haþ ido hym gret seruyce, 
oþer for he haþ iserued hym longe | tyme. 
And comynliche þes tweyne comyn togedres; 
for Ʒif þei seruede hym long tyme, 
he dede hym moche seruyce and agenward. 
Nathales þes tweyne mow be departed, 
for a man serueþ not anoþer 
but in þew tyme 
whanne it is to doynge. 
And it may be þat in long tyme 
is but litel to doynge 
and in litel tyme moche to doynge. 
And þis sixte þat meueþ to myldenesse 
is not þe fifte þat ‡ takeþ heede of lengþe of tyme, 
for þe fifte takeþ hede of manye workes. 
Wherfore Ʒif it happeþ 
þat a sogett trespasseþ in eny party of tyme 
þat haþ wel ibore hym 
al þe tyme tofore honde, 
with hym it is to doynge merciabliche. 
And it is to takynge more heede to moche as to al þe hoole tyme tofore honde þanne to þis litel partye of tyme 
in þe whiche he haþ itrespassed. 
Þerfore it is iseide, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
þat a iuge scholde take heede not onliche 
how it is now wiþ hym þat is accused, 
but also what manere man he haþ 
ibe long tyme tofore honde. f. 150r 5 10 15 
Þe seuenþe 
þat meueþ to myldenesse is goodnesse passynge malice. 
For as good passeþ euel 
and is more worthi to be chose þanne is euel, 
so it is bettere to haue mynde of good and of gracious dedes 
þat we hauen ifonge of a man 
þan of wronges 
þat we hauen ifonge of hym. 
And in þis doynge Iulius Cesar 
was gretliche ipreysed for, 
as it is iseid, 
he hadde no mynde of wronges 
but for <Ʒ> at hem. 
Also Ʒif on trespassede aƷenst vs þat haþ ido vs moche good tofore honde, 
we schulde do merciabliche by hym | 
and haue more mynde of þe good þat he haþ ido vs þan of þe wronge. 
Þerfore, primo Rethoricorum, 
þe philosofer wol meue iuges to mercy aƷenst hem 
þat trespassen aƷenst hem, 
and seith þat þei scholde haue more mynde of good 
þat þei hauen ifonge of hym 
þat trespassen þan of wrong 
þat he haþ idoo. 
Þe eiƷte is his pacience 
þat is accused. 
For Ʒif oon is accused 
of eny trespas 
for þe whiche he is ponysched by þe iuge, 
Ʒif he takeþ 
þat ponyschynge pacientliche, aworthe, and gruccheþ 
not in þe penaunce 
þat is isette hym, 
it is to doynge þe more merciabliche by hym. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
þat it is to foreƷeuynge to mankynde Ʒif he 
þat haþ peyne takeþ it pacientliche. 
Þe nynþe is ablenesse to be amended. 
For som men ben able to ben amended and ichasted 
þat þei ben amended 
onliche by blamynge oþer 
by a word and leueþ to do amys. 
And suche scholde be gretliche ispared 
and ful goodliche itreted. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
þat a iuge scholde spare þe more Ʒif he 
þat trespasseþ 
wol be more idemed 
by word þan by dede. 
Þe tenþe þat meueþ to mercye and to myldenesse 
is his lownesse and myldenesse 
þat trespasseþ. 
For Ʒif he þat trespasseþ loweþ hymself and mekeþ hym atte fulle and putteþ hym hoolliche 
atte iuges wille, 
he scholde be þe more ispared. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
þat a iuge epyeikes 
(þat is passynge riƷtful) 
schulde spare mankynde Ʒif he seeþ 
þat [he þat] trespasseþ draweþ more to þe iuges wille þan to deceyt. 
| 
For it is al aƷenst reson of mankynde 
to spare hem not 
þat mekeþ hem, 
for bestes sparen suche. 
For ho[u]ndes greuen not hem 
þat meken hem and fallen doun tofore hem. 
Þerfore it is iseide, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þat wrethe 
<cess>eþ aƷenst hem 
þat mekeþ hem. 
Also houndes ben mylde and biten not hem þat sitten.40 f. 150v 5 
Þanne it is declared 
how iuges scholde be more mylde þan cruel. 
And Ʒif iuges scholde do so, 
moche more kynges and princes scholde so 
for kynges and princes scholde haue more goodnesse. 
Also þei scholde be mylde and goodliche not onliche touchinge riƷt, 
for þerwiþ-oute may not þe pees of þe regne 
and good staat of citeseyns stonde, 
but sauynge comune profit and pees of þe regne as forþ as it is possible 
þei scholde be inclyned to mercye. 
And how mercie may stonde with riƷt 
it schal be declared here after. Chapter XXIV 
For lawes be som what of riƷt 
by þe whiche we ben irewled in oure dedes, 
demynge by lawes 
what is riƷt 
and what is wrong in oure dedes, 
it is playnliche iknowe þat 
as we distingweþ riƷt 
we may distingwe lawes and aƷenward. 
And boþe of riƷt 
and of lawe we may make fyue distinccions. 
Tweyne þerof ben itouched, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
þe þridde is isette, 
v Ethicorum, and þe ferþe is ivsed among legistres, 
and we may putte þe fifte. RiƷt, 
þat is lawe, 
is distingwed, 
for som is iwrete 
and som not iwrete, 
and som is comyne 
and som is propre, 
and som is kyndeliche 
and som is lawefulliche and imaad. 
| 
And þe philosofer makeþ þis þre distinccions of riƷt and of lawe. 
But legistres distynguen 
in þe ferþe manere and meneþ 
þat som riƷt is icleped ius gencium, 
as it were riƷt oþer lawe of nacions. 
And som riƷt and lawe is icleped ius ciuile, 
riƷtful lawe of ciuel. 
Þanne as legistres setteþ differences bytweyne kyndeliche riƷt and riƷt of nacions, 
we may sette difference 
bytwene kyndeliche riƷt and riƷt of bestes 
and Ʒeueþ þe fifþe distinccioun of riƷt menynge 
þat þer is foure manere of riƷt: 
kyndelich riƷt, riƷt of bestes, riƷt of nacions, 
and ciuel riƷt. 
And þese fyue distincciouns 
þat we maken of riƷt 
oþer of riƷtful 
we may make of lawe. 
Þanne for to declare alle þese 
and for to brynge al þese diuersitees to acorde, 
it is to wetynge 
þat þer is double riƷt-wisnesse 
þat is icleped iusticia 
oþer double lawe, 
lawe of kynde and lawe imaad. And kynde riƷt is icleped 
what is acordyng to kynde, 
oþer riƷtful is icleped 
þat folweþ kynde resoun 
and to þe whiche we ben kyndeliche inclined. 
And a positif riƷt is deuyded, 
for som what is riƷtful not of kynde 
but by ordinance 
oþer heeste of men; 
also, 
for kynde of thinges 
is þe same in eche place, 
for what is fuyre in oon place 
as in Fraunce is fuyre in anoþer place 
as in Ytalie, 
for thinges ben þe same in eche place 
þei he haue not þe same names. 
But statutes of men and ordenaunce of cite- seyns and hestes of princes 
ben not þe same in eche place. 
Perfore it is þat kyndelich riƷt [is distingued fro positif riƷt, 
for kyndelich riƷt] 
haþ þe same myƷt in eche place 
as it is iseid, 
v Ethicorum. 
But positif riƷt and riƷtful bindeþ not | 
noþer vnbyndeþ 
ar it be iordeyned by statute, 
and þanne it byndeþ first. 
And cause whi it nedeþ to haue riƷt and riƷt- ful positif to riƷt of kynde 
is for manye thinges 
ben riƷtful by kynde – 
as by kynde it is riƷtful 
þat a man speke, 
for we hauen kynde inclynacioun for to speke 
and for to telle 
oþere men by speche 
what we hauen in þouƷt. 
But for to speke þis langage oþer þat it is not kyndeliche 
but as men likeþ, 
þerfore it is 
þat al men speken 
but not al men speken þe same langage. 
Þerfore, [i] Periarmanyas, 
þe philosofer seith 
þat voice and speche 
is at likynge and seith, primo Poleticorum, 
þat kynde Ʒeueþ vs speche. 
Þanne as spekynge is kyndeliche, 
so spe[k]yng is positif and at likynge. 
So ponyschyng of þeues 
and sleyng of euel doers is kyndeliche, 
for kynde resoun wol þat it be so and we hauen kynde inclynacioun þerto for suche doyng comeþ 
of kynde of þynges. 
For it is kyndeliche 
þat a partye be put in perel 
for sauacioun of al þe hoole, 
as a roted lyme is itorne and igurd of for to 
saue al þe body – 
so a þeef and an euel doere 
þat desturbleþ pees of citeseyns 
and ariseþ aƷenst comyn profit. 
Þerfore kynde riƷt wol 
þat he be dede 
as a roted lyme is igurd of for to 
saue þe comyn profit fro perel. 
Þanne it is kyndeliche 
þat suche dedes be iponysched, 
but for to ponysche suche dedes in þat manere oþer in þis wise it is positif. 
Þerfore among al men 
þat wol lyue cyuel lif, 
euel dedes ben iponysched; 
but not among alle men 
þe same euele dedes ben iponysched 
by þe same paynes. 
Þanne where | kyndeliche riƷt endeþ 
þere positif riƷt bygynneþ to springe, 
for alwey ordinaunce 
þat is ifounde by craft of men 
is igrounded in þynges 
þat comeþ of kynde. 
And positif riƷt þat is ifounde 
by wit and craft of men 
may not be wiþoute kynde riƷt as þynges 
þat ben by craft 
mowe not be wiþoute thinges þat comeþ of kynde. 
Wherfore Ʒif kynde riƷt wol þat þefes and euel doers be ponysched, 
positif riƷt supposeþ 
þat and passeþ 
forþere and ordeyneþ 
how suche scholde be ponysched. 
For þis is iknowe, 
as it longeþ to þis doynge 
we may assigne double difference 
bytwene kynde riƷt and positif riƷt. 
Þe firste is for kynde riƷt is iknowe at firste, 
and positif riƷt is not anon iknowe 
but it is ifounde 
by witte and craft of men. 
And for kynde ryƷt and kynde lawe 
is so anoon yknowe 
and what is sympliche of kynde, 
it is iseid þat kynde riƷt and kynde lawe 
is iwrete in owre hertes. 
For men þat hauen no is iwrete in here hertes. 
And for positif rigt and lawe 
is not so iwrete in herte, 
it mot be iwrete in som outward substance 
for to kepe it in mynde. 
Also eiþer riƷt and lawe, 
boþe kyndelich and positif, 
may be wrete in som outward substaunce. 
But it is not so greet nede 
to write kynde rigt 
and l[aw]e outward 
as it is to write so positif rigt and lawe, 
for it may not so passe out of mynde 
as positif rigt may. Þe seconde diuersete 
is for kynde rigt 
is þe same among alle men | 
and is þerfore icleped comyne rigt 
oþer comyn lawe. 
But positif rigt and positif lawe 
is diuers in diuerse citees 
and is þerfore icleped proper rigt and proper lawe. 
As þe philosofer reherseþ, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
þerfore Empedocles clepeþ 
kynde rigt oþer kynde lawe fuyre 
þat streccheþ alwey 
by gret clernesse; 
for fuyre in his owne spere and place streccheþ 
more þan oþere elementes 
and is more large 
þan alle þe oþere 
and is ilikned to kynde rigt 
and to kynde lawe 
þat is more large and more comyn þan positif rigt and lawe 
and more clerliche iknowe. f. 151v 10 15 Herby it may be knowe 
þat al þe distinccions 
þat þe philosofer makeþ of rigt 
oþer of riƷtful 
mowe be reducte to positif riƷt 
and to kynde riƷt. 
For as it is declared, 
kynde riƷt is not iwrete 
but it is comyn and by kynde, 
and po[s]iti[f] riƷt 
is icleped riƷt iwrete, 
imaad and laweful. 
And what is þe soþe menyng of þe riƷt of naciouns 
þat is icleped ius gencium 
and of riƷt of bestes 
þat is icleped ius animalium, 
in þe nexte chapitre it schal be declared. Chapter XXV 
Alle þe distincciouns of riƷt and of lawe 
þat þe philosofer toucheþ in þe nexte chapitre 
tofore ben of twey menbris of þe whiche oo membre is conteyned vnder riƷt and lawe of kynde 
and þe oþer vnder riƷt 
and lawe of ciuel oþer lawe positif. 
But as it is iseide, 
Iegistres don to þe þridde membre 
and clepeþ it ius gencium, 
as it were riƷt and lawe of naciouns. 
And by þat manere of spekynge 
þe ferþe menbre may be do to and be icleped ius animalium, lawe of bestes. 
For euedences herof it | 
is to wetynge þat man 
in þat he is man 
and itake 
by his owne propre resoun 
is oþer þan oþere bestes; 
but in þat man is a best 
and itake by comyn resoun, 
man accordeþ with oþere bestes. 
Þanne Ʒif thinges ben of kyndelich riƷt 
to þe whiche we hauen kynde appetite and inclinacioun, 
‡ suche kynde appetite 
folweþ oure kynde 
in þat we ben men 
and in þat we ben oþere þan oþere bestes; 
and such riƷt oþer lawe 
is icleped ius gencium, 
as it were riƷt of men oþer of nacions. 
And Ʒif þat inclinacioun and appetite folweþ oure kynde 
in þat it accordeþ 
with oþere bestes, 
so it is icleped ius naturale, 
kynde riƷt oþer lawe. 
Þerfore in þe Institutes, 
De Iure Naturali, 
where þis matere is itreted, 
it is iseid 
þat ius naturale, 
kynde riƷt, 
is þat kynde techeþ alle bestes. 
And as it is iseid þere, 
suche riƷt is not onliche of mankynde 
but of alle bestes 
þat breden in heuene oþere 
in erþe oþer in þe see. 
And by þis doynge of kynde riƷt, 
maal and femel comen togeders and gendren children 
and bryngen hem forþ. 
For Ʒif man is kyndeliche inclined herto, 
and Ʒif suche inclinacioun 
and appetite folweþ mankynde, 
‡ [it folweþ] 
not in þat þat it is mankynde 
but in þat þat it is kynde of beestes 
and in þat þat it accordeþ 
with oþere bestes; 
for oþer bestes 
ben inclyned 
that maal and femel come togeders 
and gendre children 
and feede and norische hem. 
And ius gencium, 
riƷt of men oþer of nacions, 
is not comyne to oþere beestes 
but it is comyn to al mankynde. 
And of þis riƷt 
and lawe comeþ nyƷ alle contractes as byggyng and sellyng | 
and huryng and settynge to huyre and oþere suche doynges 
withoute þe whiche companye of mankynde 
is not suffisauntto itself in leuynge. 
Þerfore it is þat borwynge and leyenge to wedde 
þat helpeþ to leuynge of mankynde 
is conteyned vnder þis riƷt and lawe 
þat hatte ius gencium, lawe of folk. 
And oþere bestes comuneþ 
not in suche doynge. 
Þanne ius gencium, lawe of folk, 
is as it were kynde riƷt idrawe of kynde. f. 152r 15 20 
Also þat riƷt and lawe 
þat kynde techeþ 
alle beestes and folweþ oure inclinacioun in þat we accorden wiþ 
oþere beestes is icleped kynde riƷt in comparisoun to þe riƷt 
þat hatte ius gencium. 
For Ʒif thinges þat ben iseid 
in þe nexte chapitre ben iknowe, 
kynde riƷt is som what comyne 
and som what yknowe. 
And þe more riƷt is iknowe 
and þe more comyne it is 
and þe more vnchangeable, 
þe more it is worthi 
to be cleped kynde riƷt. 
And þat riƷt þat kynde techeþ alle bestes 
and by þe whiche alle beestes acordeþ 
is more comyn 
þan þe riƷt þat hatte ius gencium; 
and so it is more yknowe, 
for þyng þat is most comyne 
is most iknowe to vs. 
For þe more general a þyng is, 
þe better we knowen it. 
Also suche riƷt is more vnchangeable; 
for þe more þe rewles of lawe ben applied to a special matere, 
þe mo defautes þei drawen and failleþ 
in þe moo caas 
and ben þe more chaungeable. 
Þanne suche a riƷt is worthi 
to be clepede kynde riƷt 
in comparisoun to þe riƷt 
þat hatte ius gencium. 
For it is iknowe how þe riƷt 
þat hatte ius gencium, law of puple, 
is oþer þan þe riƷt 
þat hatte ius naturale, it may be knowe how þe riƷt | 
þat hatte ius animalium 
is oþer þan þe riƷt 
þat hatte ius naturale. 
For as mankynde 
in so moche as man is a beest 
þei accorden with kynde of oþere beestes, 
so in so moche as he is man, 
he leueþ and haþ beynge and acordeþ 
with treen 
and with herbes 
and with oþere substaunce 
and with alle þynges þat ben. 
For man desireþ kyndelich to be kept 
and saued in beyng, 
and so doun alle oþere doynges; 
and desiren kyndeliche to gendre children 
and to brynge hem forþ, 
and so doþ oþer bestes; 
and desiren to lyue in companye 
by good couenantes and forewardes, 
and among alle bestes 
þat is proper to mankynde. 
Þanne Ʒif reweles and dedes and doynge ben igrounded in þat þat man desireþ kyndeliche to be, 
so suche reweles mow be of kynde riƷt 
as mankynde 
is a manere beynge and accordeþ 
with alle thinges þat ben. 
And Ʒif thilke rewles ben itake for man desireþ 
kyndeliche to gendre children 
and to brynge hem forþ, 
also þey mowe be of kynde riƷt 
as it is iseid 
þat kynde riƷt is 
þat kynde techeþ alle beestes. 
But Ʒif þei ben itake for man desireþ 
to lyue in companye by foreward and couenant, 
so þei ben of kynde riƷt as kynde riƷt is idrawe to þe riƷt þat hatte ius gencium 
and is proper oonliche to mankynde. 
Herby it is iknowe þat as þe riƷt þat hatte ius gencium is not so kynde riƷt as þe riƷt þat kynde techeþ alle bestes, 
so þe riƷt þat kynde techeþ alle bestes is not so kynde riƷt as þe riƷt þat folweþ þe inclinacioun of oure kynde 
in þat we accordeþ 
not [onlich] wiþ 
oþere beestes 
but also wiþ alle þynges þat beþ. 
For suche riƷt is more iknowe and more comyne 
þan þe oþere, 
for desire | of good and of beynge and voydynge of harme and of not beynge 
is more of kynde 
riƷt þanne desirynge of gendryng and bryngynge forþ of children. 
Þanne þis schal be þe ordre: 
riƷt þat folweþ oure kynde in so moche 
as we desiren beynge and good is more riƷt of kynde 
þan þe riƷt of beestes 
oþer þe riƷt þat kynde techeth alle beestes; 
also suche riƷt is more kynde riƷt þan þe riƷt þat hatte ius gencium, lawe and riƷt of men oþer of naciouns; 
and is more kyndelich þan riƷt and lawe of ciuel 
þat is al positif. 
Þanne þre ben in som wise of kyndelich riƷt 
in so moche as inclynacioun folweþ oure kynde. 
For Ʒif þat inclinacioun folweþ oure kynde 
in so moche 
as it is mankynde, 
þanne is þe riƷt þat hatte ius gencium. 
And Ʒif it folweþ oure kynde 
in þat we accorden with oþere beestes, 
so is þe riƷt þat kynde techeþ alle beestes. 
And Ʒif it folweþ oure kynde 
in þat we accorden with alle thinges, 
þanne is þe riƷt þat is excellentliche icleped kynde riƷt. 
For desiryng of beynge 
and of good and voydynge of corupcioun and of harme 
þat we desiren kyndelich, 
in so moche as oure kynde accordeþ wiþ alle thinges, 
is so of kynde riƷt; 
for oþere rewles and oþere lawes, 
boþe kynde lawes and cyuel lawes, 
springeþ here of 
and is igrounded here inne, 
for in alle me takeþ heede of getynge of good 
oþer of voidyng of harme. 
But for to trete þis 
atte fulle nedeþ an heyƷere doynge, 
and be it inow 
at þis tyme 
for to knowe how þe riƷt ius gencium and þe riƷt ius animalium 
and also ius ciuile ben oþere þan ius naturale, 
kyn|deliche riƷt. Chapter XXVI 
It semeþ þat þe rigt ius cyuyle 
oþer ius gencium 
þat is positif is ilikned to þre: 
to kynde rigt, 
oþer to lawe of kynde 
of þe whiche it springeþ; 
to þe comyn profit wherfore it is iordeyned; 
and to þe men þat schal be reweled þerby. 
Panne lawe sch[o]lde haue [þ]ree 
as it is ilikned to þes þree. 
As it is ilikned 
to lawe of kynde, 
it mot be riƷtful; 
as it is ilikned to þe comyn profit, 
it mot be good and profitable; 
and as it is ilikned to men 
þat scholde be rewled þerby, 
it mot be accordynge and couenable 
to vsage of contraye and of tyme. 
For in nedes and in dedes 
som what mot be graunted 
to þe vsage of contrey and of tyme 
and to maners of man; 
for as suche ben diuers, 
it nedeþ to haue som diuersetee in lawes. 
Firste, lawe of mankynde 
þat is positif mot be riƷtful 
as it is ilikned to kynde resoun 
and to lawe of kynde. 
For but if it be riƷtful, 
it is no lawe bote corupcioun of lawe; 
for no þyng is riƷtfulliche iordeyned of man 
but it springe in som wise of lawe of kynde and but <if> kynde resoun wol 
þat it be iordeyned. 
Þe seconde, lawe of men 
þat is cyuel scholde be profitable 
as it is ilikned 
to þe comyn profit. 
For Ʒif þe comyn profite 
is not desired in a lawe, 
it is not riƷtful but euel and tyraunt lawe. 
For as a kyng is oþer þan a tyraunt 
for a kyng 
is icleped rex 
and haþ þe name of riƷtful rewelynge and desireþ þe comyn profit 
and a tyraunt rewleþ 
amys and desireþ his owne profit, 
so þe lawe of a kyng is riƷtful 
in þe whiche þe comyn profit is desired 
and is oþer þan þe euel tyrauntes lawe in þe | 
whiche priuate profite is desired. 
For it nedeþ in riƷtful lawes 
þat comyn profit be desired, 
for alwey þe ende rewle 
is of al oþere dedes. 
For it is comynliche iseid 
Ʒif we desiren þes þynges 
and wolle come þerto, 
we mote do suche dedes. 
Þanne lawes 
þat ben rewle of oure dedes 
schulde be suche as nedeþ to profit and to þe ende þat is desired. 
Þanne for þe comyn profit 
is betere þan priuat profit 
and haþ more resoun of þe ende 
þan priuat profit, 
for priuat profit 
is iordeyned 
for †þe comyn profit†, 
it nedeþ þat lawes be maad 
not suche as nedeþ 
for priuat profit 
but suche as nedeþ 
for þe comyn profit, 
for it haþ more resoun of þe ende. 
And so þerby lawes scholde be maad and rewles of oure dedes. 
And for priuat profit is not good 
but for it is iordeyned 
for þe comyn profit, 
for þe partye is foule þat accordeþ not to þe hoole, 
Ʒif eny propre profit 
is desired in lawes, 
þat scholde not be but for so moche 
as it is iordeyned 
for þe comyn profit. 
Þe þridde, 
lawe as it is ilikned to þe puple 
þat schal be reweled 
þerby scholde be pesible 
and acordyng 
to þe contraie 
and to þe vsage and maners of men. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
iiii Poleticorum, 
þat it nedeþ not to make contreyes 
accordynge to lawes 
but lawes accordynge to contreys; 
and þe lawes mot be diuerse 
by diuersete of contrees. 
Þanne he þat wol make lawe scholde besiliche take hede of maners 
and condicions of men and Ʒeue hem suche lawes 
as hem semen spedful for hem. 
For it is iknowe what lawes and wat kynges and princes 
scholde be and þat lawes 
scholde be made riƷtful | ‡ and profitable and accordyng to þe men 
þat schal be reweled þerby, 
it may be sone iknowe 
þat it is spedful to regne 
and to citee to make suche lawes. 
For som men ben so good 
þat þei ben inclyned for honeste 
for to do vertuos workes 
and to leue euele workes. 
And som men þei he be not suffisaunt of hemself 
by here owne disposicioun 
to do good and leue euele, 
Ʒut þei ben able to be tauƷt of oþere men 
and to be drawe to goode by wordes 
oþer onliche by blamynge. 
But som men ben so euel 
þat þei ben not inclyned 
to good of hemself 
oþer amended by oþere men. 
Þanne namliche for suche men 
it nedeþ to make lawes 
þat hauen powere to constreyne 
as it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum. 
Þanne lawes ben imaad 
as it is spedful 
þat he be maad, 
nameliche for þei 
þat wol lette þe pees of citeseyns scholde for drede of payne leue to do amys. [Chapter XXVII] 
As it is declared, 
lawes ben certeyne rewles of oure dedes and ordeyneþ 
vs to þe comyn profit 
and hauen power 
to compelle and constrayne. 
By tweye weyes we may preue 
þat not eche man scholde make lawes. 
Þe firste is itake for lawes ordeyneþ vs to þe comyn profit. 
Þe seconde, 
for þei hauen power 
to compelle and constrayne. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For he þat scholde ordeyne 
and rewle men 
to som good scholde make lawes and rewles of dedes 
by þe whiche men mow come to þat good. 
Þanne for þe comyne profit 
is principaliche desired 
of al þe comynte 
as of al þe puple 
oþer of þe prince 
þat scholde | be comyn persone and solempne, 
lawes þat ordeyneþ vs to þe comyn profit 
scholde be maad of þe prince 
þat scholde ordeyne a[nd] rewle 
oþer men to suche good, 
oþer lawes scholde be maad of al þe puple Ʒif al þe puple 
haþ þe principate 
and haþ power to chese a prince. 
Þanne no lawe is imaad 
but of hym þat scholde rewle oþere to þe comyn profit. 
For as þe lawe of God 
and of kynde is imaad of God 
þat rewleþ alle þynges to hymself ward 
and is most comyn good and profit 
for he is good of alle good, 
so þe positif lawe of mankynde 
is imaad of þe prince 
oþer of al puple Ʒif al þe puple haþ þe principate. 
Also þe prince oþer al þe puple Ʒif þei hauen principate 
scholde ordeyne and rewle oþere men to comyn profit. 
And eche particuler persone þat is [‡ partie] 
of multitude sum scholde holde þe lawes, 
but not eche persone scholde make lawes. 
Þe seconde wey to preue þe same is itake for lawes 
hauen power to compelle and constreyne. 
And eche man of þe puple 
may warne and charge anoþer to do wel. 
Bote suche wamynges and chargynges 
ben not icleped lawes, 
for þei mowe not compelle and constrayne. 
But strecchinge þe name of lawe, 
eche heste and eche warnyng 
may be cleped lawe. 
And in þat manere of spekynge 
as þe philosofer seith, 
primo Poleticorum, 
Homerus seide þat eche man makeþ lawes 
to children and to wyues. 
For Homerus wolde mene 
þat wamynges and heestes þat an housebond Ʒeueþ to wif and to children 
and to oþere of his hous 
mowe be cleped lawes; 
but | þat is not by proper takyng of lawes. 
For as on singuler persone 
is iordeined to good and profit of an hous 
þat is more hool and more comyn profit 
þanne a singuler persone, 
so profit of an hous 
is iordeyned 
to cyuel profit <and to profit> of a regne 
þat is also more hoole and more parfit. 
Wherefore Ʒif of þe more parfit 
þat haþ more reson of þe ende lawes 
scholde be take and rewles of dedes, 
it folweth þat not of priuat profit noþer of profit of hous 
but of þe comyn profit 
þat is desired in þe regne 
and citee lawe scholde be take and rewles of dedes. 
And for þe housebonde noþer a priuat persone haþ power to constrayne 
and to compelle propreliche noþer 
to sle euel doers 
but a prince oþer a solempne persoun 
þat is ouer a regne oþer a citee oþer 
ouer anoþer comynte, 
þerfore lawes 
þat mowe compelle and constrayne schulde not ben imaad 
bute of hym 
that is ouer the comynte 
that hath the principate of lordschipe. For it is iknowe 
þat not eche man scholde Ʒeue lawe, 
it may be sone iknowe 
þat lawe byndeþ 
not 
but it be publisched among þe puple. 
For lawe is a certeyne hest of þe souerayne 
by þe whiche we ben ibounde 
and irewled in oure dedes, 
for þe heste of a souereyne byndeþ 
not 
but it be iknowe to þe sogettes. 
Ʒif a lawe schal bynde, 
it mot be ipublisched, 
icried and iknowe. 
But for lawe of kynde and lawe positif ben diuerse, 
þei ben diuerseliche ipublisched and iknowe. 
For lawe of kynde 
is igeue of God in oure hertes, 
it is þerfore iknowe in eche man 
whanne he bygynneþ to knowe 
what is to doyng 
and what is not to doynge, 
[in þat þes] longeþ to kynde rigt. 
Bute lawe of men is promulgate 
and iknowe whanne it is iwrete and icried and declared outward. 
Þanne for in riƷt lawes 
þat ben not 
con|trarie to lawes of kynde stondeþ of sauacioun of regne and citee, 
kynges and princes schulde besiliche take heede what lawes þei scholde Ʒeue to here men and puple. 
But whanne lawes ben imaad and iƷeue for suche lawes scholde bynde, 
þei scholde crie suche lawes 
and make hem iknowe. 
And whanne þei ben iknowe, 
make hem ikepte and iholde. 
For as þe filoso- fer seiþ, 
4 Poleticorum, 
abou[t]e lawe schuld ben dubbil charge: first, 
þat lawis ben wel imad. 
Þe ii, 
þat þei ben wel ikepte and iholde so 
þat men be wel obedient to lawes 
þat beþ so imaad. Chapter XXVII[I We hauen declared in chapitres tofore 
what lawes kynges 
and princes scholde make: 
riƷtful lawes, profitable, 
and acordyng to þe puple 
þat schal be rewled þerby. 
And in þis chapitre we wol trete whiche ben þe effectes of lawes 
and what workes 
and how many suche lawes scholde conteyne. 
And it is iseide 
þat þe effectes of lawe by fyue, 
oþer fyue 
ben þe workes of lawe: comaunde, suffre, forbede, reward, ponysche. 
And as it is iseid tofore, 
lawes ben certeyne rewles of oure workes; 
and as phisik rewleþ humours of mankynde 
and makeþ hem euene 
by dyetynge, 
by drenches, 
and oþere medicines 
þat ben conteyned in phisik: 
so by lawes 
and by oþere thinges 
þat ben itauƷt in þe science of polecie 
(þat is on rewlyng of citee and of regne), 
þe science of polecie ‡ wolle rewle þe workes of mankynde 
and make hem riƷtful so 
þat citeseyns mowe lyue riƷtfulliche and wel. 
And aboute workes of mankynde 
may be double charge 
– oon whanne þei ben to comynge 
and not Ʒut idoo; 
| þe oþer whanne þei ben ido in dede. 
And in eiþer wise makers of lawe scholde haue charge of workes of mankynde. 
And touchynge workes 
þat ben to comynge 
and not Ʒit idoo 
þre longeþ to lawes: 
hotynge, and suffrynge, and forbedynge. 
And touch- inge workes 
þat ben ido in dede 
tweyne doynges longeþ to lawes: ponyschinge and rewardyng. 
For as it is comynliche iseide, 
workes of mankynde 
ben in þre manere diuersite, 
for some ben good and vertuous; 
and som be euel; 
[and som ben mene,] 
as þelke workes 
þat ben of hemself indifferent, 
noþer good noþer euel. 
For manye workes ben of hemself 
as it were indifferent, 
noþer good noþer euel, 
þei he mowe 
by þe entent of hem 
þat worcheþ be good oþer euel, 
to preys- ynge oþer to blamynge. 
As takyng vp ‡ of a strawe 
fro þe ground 
is of itself a work indifferent 
noþer good noþer euel, 
naþalees Ʒif on takeþ vp a strawe wiþ euel entente as for to putte his felowe 
in þe eƷe þanne 
it is a schrewed work 
and to blamynge. 
And Ʒif þei gedren vp strawe for to make clene an hous oþer to do som oþer good worke 
for þe good entent of þe worchere, 
þe work 
þat is of itself indifferent 
may be vertuous 
and to preysynge. 
Þanne by þis þre manere of workes 
þat ben to doynge 
þre doynges longeþ to lawes: 
hootynge, touchynge good workes; 
forbedynge, touchynge euel workes; 
and suffrynge, touchynge workes 
þat ben indifferent. 
Nathalees it is to takynge heede 
þat for lawe is comynliche iset | 
to alle men and comynliche not alle men 
reccheþ to þe myddel of goodnesse 
for not alle men mowe be parfit at alle poyntes, 
it longeþ to þe makere of lawe not onlichje 
to suffre indifferent workes 
not forbedyng noþer hotynge suche workes, 
but also it longeþ to hym 
to suffry suche workes 
þat ben not notabliche euel. 
For Ʒif þe makere of lawe 
wolde forbede and ponysche al manere euel 
were it not so lite, 
vnneþe oþer neuere he myƷte rewle eny puple. 
Þerfore not onliche indifferent workes mowe be suffred but also þe Ʒeuere of lawe 
may suffre workes of litel malice. 
For it is iknowe what longeþ to lawes touchynge workes 
þat ben to doynge, 
it may be sone iknowe what longeþ þerto. 
And so tweyne longeþ þerto, 
ponyschyng and rewardynge. 
As notable euele workes 
scholde be forbode 
or he be do 
and iponysched 
whan þei ben ido; 
and notabliche good workes ben counsaile 
and ihoote ar a be do 
and rewarde whanne 
þei ben ido 
and not iponysched. 
Þanne fyue doynges longeþ to lawes, 
tweyne touchinge good workes, 
hotyng ar þei ben idoun 
and rewardyng whanne þei ben ido; 
and tweyne touchynge euel workes, 
forbedyng or þei ben ido 
and ponyschyng whan þei ben ido. 
But on longeþ to lawes touching workes 
þat ben indifferent oþer 
as it were indifferent, 
and þat is suffryng. 
And for þes ben thus itreted, 
sey we þat kynges and princes 
þat scholde be besy aboute þe comyn profit and aboute | rewelyng of regne 
and of citee scholde 
also besiliche avise and take heed what lawes 
and what statutes 
þei setten to þe citeseyns 
so 
þat þei scholde besiliche examine by hemself 
and by here counsaillours 
and take heede what goode workes scholde be ihoote 
and what euel workes scholde be forbode and iponysched 
and what scholde be let passe and isuffred. Chapter XX[IX The philosofer, 
iii [Polet]icorum inquireþ 
wheþer it were bettere for regne 
and cite 
to be rewled 
by þe best kyng 
oþer 
by þe beste lawe, 
and maken tweyne resons 
þat it were bettere for a regne 
to be rewled by þe beste lawe 
þan by þe beste kyng. 
Þe first wey is itake 
for a kyng scholde be 
as it were instrument of þe lawe. 
Þe seconde, 
for a kyng may be corupte sonere þan þe lawe. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For as it is iseid, 
v Ethicorum, 
a prince scholde be wardeyn and kepere of riƷt and of riƷt lawe, 
for a good prince 
is as it were of riƷt lawe so 
þat what riƷt lawe commaundeþ 
þe kyng 
by ciuel powere scholde 
make it be iholde and ikept. 
Wherfore Ʒif what is more principale 
is betere 
in rewelyng þanne þe instrument, 
it is bettere to be rewled 
by þe beste lawe þanne by þe beste kyng. 
And so toucheþ þe philosofer, iii Poleticorum, 
and seith þat bettere it is þat lawe haue principate 
þan kynges and princes for kynges and princes scholde be ordeyned 
to be kepers and seruantes of lawes. 
Þe seconde wey to preue þe same is itake 
for a kyng 
may be corrup sonnere þan lawe. 
For a kyng is a man, 
he haþ not onlich wit 
but also wit wiþ desire and coueitise; 
þei a kyng may not be corupte 
by witte and | vnderstondyng, 
Ʒit he may be corupte for þey haue þerwiþ desire and coueitise. 
Þerfore it is iseid, iii Ethicorum, 
þat som tyme woodnesse and coueitise 
mysturnen þe beste men 
[and] sleeth hem atte last. 
For þe beste man is islawe by coueitise: 
þei he be not islawe 
in beyng of kynde, 
nathales he is islawe 
in beyng þe best; 
for whanne þe beste man 
bygynneþ 
to be wood 
and wrongfulliche coueitous, 
þeis he be not islawe 
in beynge of kynde, 
Ʒit he is islayn in beynge þe beste 
for he is no lengere þe beste. 
Also a kyng haþ wit 
and vnderstondynge with coueytise. 
But for lawe perteyneþ to resoun, 
it semeþ wit alone. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
tercio Poleticorum, 
þat he þat commaundeþ [þat] wit and vnderstondyng haþ principate commandeþ 
þat God and lawe haþ principate; 
but he [þat] commaundeþ 
þat a man be a prince, 
for coueitise, 
commaundeþ þat a beest be prince. 
Þanne by þes resons it semeþ preued 
þat bettere it is 
þat regne and cite be rewled 
by lawe þan by a kyng. 
But, iii Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer declareþ 
þat þis is not alwey to doynge, 
for as he seith þe lawe seith generalliche þyng 
þat schal not be generalliche iholde. 
For be lawes of mankynde 
neuere so wisliche imaad, 
þei mot faille in som caas. Þanne betere it is 
þat a regne be rewled by a kyng 
þan by lawe, 
for þe defaute of þe lawe 
may be mended by þe kyng. 
Also for to knowe 
what is to spekynge in þis matere 
it is to wetynge 
þat a kyng and eche prince 
is mene bytwene lawe 
of kynde and lawe positif. 
For no man is riƷtful prince 
but he worche by riƷt resoun, 
for resoun scholde be rewelere of workes of mankynde. 
Where|fore a kyng 
is icleped rex 
and haþ þat name of regendo, 
rewelynge, 
and scholde rewle 
oþere men 
and be rewle of oþere men. 
Þanne in rewelyng oþere men 
a kyng scholde folwe riƷt resoun. 
Þanne þei scholde folwe of kynde 
þat springeþ of riƷtful resoun. 
Þanne in rewlyng a kyng scholde be vnder lawe of kynde 
and in so moche 
as þei holden þe lawe of kynde, 
he reweleþ riƷtfulliche; 
but he is aboue lawe positif 
for he makeþ suche lawe 
by his owne auctorite. 
Also neuere kyng demeþ ariƷt 
but he lyne on lawe of kynde and worche by riƷt resoun; 
so neuere lawe positif byndeþ riƷtfulliche 
but it lenye on auctorite 
of a kyng oþer ‡ of anoþer prince. 
For, 
as it is iseid tofore, 
riƷt‡ positif and laweful haþ no diuersete in þe bygynnynge 
wheþer it scholde be in þis wise oþer no; 
and whanne it is imaad lawe, 
þanne it is diuerse 
by cause of auctorite of hym 
þat makeþ þe lawe. 
Wherfore lawe positif is vnder þe prince 
as lawe of kynde is aboue hym. 
And Ʒif me seith þat som lawe positif 
is aboue þe prince, 
þat is not for it is positif 
but for þerinne is som vertue of lawe of kynde. 
Þanne Ʒif me axeþ 
wheþer it is better a regne oþer a citee to be rewled 
by þe beste kyng oþer by þe beste lawe, 
Ʒif we speken of lawe of kynde, 
it is soþ 
þat þat lawe is more pryncipal in rewelynge 
þanne is þe kyng hymsilf; 
for noon is riƷtful kyng 
but in so moche 
as he lene to þat lawe. 
Wherfore it is wel iseid, 
iii Poleticorum, 
þat in riƷtful rewelyng 
non beest scholde be prince, 
[but God and vnderstondynge. 
For þanne a beest is 
prince,] 
as whanne a man fondeþ | 
not to rewle oþer 
by resoun 
but by passioun and lust and likynge, 
in þe whiche we accorden wiþ 
oþere bestes. 
For þanne God is prince and vnderstondynge 
whan a man rewleþ oþer 
by riƷtful resoun 
and by lawe of kynde, 
þe whiche lawe eche man vnderstondeþ by Ʒift of God. 
But Ʒif we speken of lawe positif, 
betere it is to be reweled 
by þe beste kynge 
þanne by þe beste lawe, 
and nameliche in cases in þe whiche suche lawes faillen 
and seyþ generalliche 
þyng þat is not iholde generalliche. 
Þanne herby þe resoun concludeþ 
þat it is imaad for þe contrarie 
þat bettere it were 
to be rewled by a kyng þan by lawe, 
for lawe may not determyne particuler doynges. 
Þerfore it is spedful 
to a kyng 
and to oþere princes 
to rewle lawe positif 
by riƷtful resoun 
and by lawe of kynde 
þat God prenteþ 
in eche mannes þouƷt. 
And it is spedful also for kyng and prince 
to be aboue laweful riƷt 
þat is positif 
and not to holde lawe 
where it is not to holdyng. 
Herby it may be knowe 
how cruelnesse and myldenesse 
mow stonde wiþ riƷt and with lawe. 
For by cause of particuler circumstaunces 
and of chaungynges 
of dedes of mankynde as þe philosofer meneþ, v Ethicorum, 
dedes of mankynde 
mowe not be mete 
and imesured with a rewle 
þat may not faille noþer bende as wiþ 
a rewle of yre, 
but he mot be mete and imesured wiþ 
a rewle of leed 
þat may be aplayed 
and acordyng to workes of mankynde. 
Þanne som tyme it nedeþ 
to bende þe lawe 
toward þe oon partie 
and do more myldeliche by hym þat trespasseth þan þe lawe seith; 
and some tyme it nedeþ to bende lawe | 
toward þe contrarie and ponysche hym þat trespasseþ more 
greuouslicheþan þe lawe seith. 
For particuler circumstaunces 
þat mowe not alle be rekened 
in þe lawe excuseþ 
som tyme þe trespas. 
And þanne riƷtfulliche and by resoun 
it is to doyng myldeliche wiþ 
hym þat trespasseþ. 
And som tyme þe circumstaunce greueþ 
and þanne þe dede scholde be ponysched wiþ 
þe more reddor. 
Þan þei cruelnesse [and] myldenesse 
seme aƷenst laweful riƷt and positif, 
nathales þei ben not al aƷenst þe lawe and riƷt Ʒif þei ben resonablich ido 
and as circumstaunce axeth. 
Þanne in demynge it is iseid 
þat som doynge comeþ 
of equite 
and somme of reddor 
and somme of myldenesse; 
for while þe rewle of lawe 
is riƷt and euene 
and not ibend 
toward þe oo partie, 
it is iseid þat domes 
þat ben imete with suche 
a rewle comeþ of equite. 
And Ʒif for good condicions of hym 
þat trespasseþ 
þe rewle of lawe 
is ibend to þe partie of mercye, 
þanne it is iseid 
þat þe rigt doom comeþ 
of grace and of myldenesse. 
But Ʒif þe forseide rewle is ibend toward þe contrarie, 
þanne þe doom comeþ of cruelnesse. 
And for al þees mowe be do resonabliche and riƷtfulliche, 
myldenesse and cruelnesse 
mowe stonde wiþ riƷt. Chapter XX[X Som men þer were 
þat triste moche on here owne witte and seide 
þat diuynyte 
is not nedful 
for we hauen bookes of philosofie and science 
in þe whiche it is itreted of alle thinges; 
and þei menen þat it nedeþ 
not to haue lawe of þe gospel and of God, 
for we hauen lawe of God 
and of kynde | 
þat forbedeþ 
al euel and comandeþ 
al good and vertues. 
But al wiþoute lawe of kynde and of men 
it is spedful 
to haue lawe of þe gospel and of God. 
And þat we may preue 
by þre resons 
þat þe doctorfes] makeþ comynliche. 
Þe firste is itake by ponyschyng of synnes, 
þe seconde by oure knowyng, 
þe þirdde by þe fynal ende 
þat we desiren to haue. 
Þe firste is declared in þis wise. 
For as it is iseid tofore, 
lawe of men ponyscheth not alle synnes 
and þat is for double cause. 
Þe firste is for comynliche 
þe puple may not recche to þe cheef parfitnesse of leuynge, 
þerfore som synnes 
mot be lette passe 
vnponysched by lawe of men so 
þat principate may longe dure among men. 
For it were not poscible 
þat a man were ‡ longe prince 
Ʒif he wolde ponysche al synnes and trespaces. 
Also þei al trespasses 
þat ben iknowe myƷt be iponysched of þe prince, 
Ʒit it is not poscible 
þat al trespasses ben ipunsched. 
For not alle trespasses bene iknowe to the prince ‡, 
for 25 som ben so 
preuey as inward þouƷt and likynge 
þat mowe not be ponysched 
by lawe of men. 
Þanne al wiþoute lawe of men 
it nedeþ to haue anoþer lawe so 
þat non euel be vnponysched 
noþer good vnrewarded. 
And herto suffiseþ not lawe of kynde as it schal be declared in þe processe. 
Þanne it nedeþ 
to haue lawe of þe gospel and of God 
þat forbedeþ 
boþe in- ward trespas and outward, 
and þei þat trespassen þeraƷen schal be ponesched heere oþer elles where. 
Herby it may be iknowe how lawe of man forbedeþ 
coueytise and likyng | 
and how it forbedeþ not, 
as it forbedeþ þe hond and not þe þouƷt. 
And it was iseide tofore 
þat þat scholde be declared. 
Þanne it is to wetynge [þat] Ʒif his entencioun 
þat makeþ 
þe lawe is iknowe, 
by lawe of men al synnes ben forbode 
oþer scholde be forbode; 
for no kyng nother maker of lawe 
haþ riƷtful entent 
but his entent be to make citeseyns 
as vertues as he may. 
Þan for no man comeþ to parfit vertue 
but his entent be forsake ‡ 
alle þe forsayde euel doynges, 
Ʒif lawe is iknowe touchynge 
th’entent of þe makere of lawe, 
it forbedeþ euele þouƷtes and euel leuynge. 
And as þe philosofer seith, 
ii‡ Polethicorum, 
þere he desputeþ aƷenst Socrates 
by þis manere wise, 
euel likynge is more forbode 
þan outward dede; 
for outward dedes bryngen vs most to vertues 
5¿f þei ben good and to vices 
Ʒif þei ben euel, 
for þei comen of þe innere appetite. 
But Ʒif lawe of men 
is iknowe not touchinge his entencioun 
þat makeþ lawe bote toching þe ponysching, 
so it is not iseide 
þat lawe forbedeþ þouƷt and euel likynge 
for it ponyscheþ 
no suche trespace. 
And in þis manere wise lawe of men 
not onliche forbedeþ [not] inward euel likynge, 
but also it forbedeþ 
not alle outward trespasses. 
For som tyme in lawes of men smale trespasses 
ben ilat passe 
as it were vn-knowe 
for to voyde grettere trespaces, 
as som tyme symple fomycacioun 
is ilet passe and not iponysched 
for to voyde greet fomicacioun and spouse breche. 
Þe seconde wey preuynge 
þat it is nedful to haue lawe of þe gospel and of God 
is itake by owre knowynge | 
and by owre vncerteyne doom. 
For of particuler doynges 
þat fallen 
and of dedes of mankynde 
ben so manye dyuerse domes of men so þat of þe same dedes and nedes 
among diuerse men ben diuerse lawes, 
and som what is riƷtful by doom of som men 
and vnriƷtful by doom of oþere men. 
Þanne for in doom of mankynde may falle doute and errour, 
it is spedful to haue lawe of þe gospel 
and of God in þe whiche may be non errour. 
Þe þridde wey is itake by fynal good 
þat we desiren to haue. 
For suche good passeþ 
and is aboue þe myƷt of vs and of oure kynde, 
þe lawe of kynde 
and þe lawe of men 
þat helpeþ vs to come to good 
þat we may haue by kynde 
ben not suffisaunt to brynge vs to good 
þat passeþ kynde. 
Þanne lawe of þe gospel 
and of God is nedful 
by þe whiche we ben iordeyned to þat good. 
Þanne kynges and princes 
þat scholde be as it were half goddes 
and haue vnderstondyng 
wiþoute myslikynge 
and be ensample of leuynge and rewle of dedes 
scholde haue hemself 
so to lawe of God 
and to lawe of kynde and of men 
so þat as þei passen 
oþere men in myƷte and in dignite, 
so þei scholde passe hem in vertue and in goodnesse. Chapter XXX[I Secundo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer disputeþ aƷenste Ipodomus and axeþ Ʒif 
it is spedful to citeseyns 
to chaunge lawes of þe cuntrey and to brynge in newe vsages. 
And as it is iseid tofore, 
Ipodomus ordeynede 
þat he þat fondeþ 
eny lawe profitable for a citee 
scholde haue | worschep in þat cite. 
And for comynliche men desiren worschep, 
manye were imeued and fonde 
vp manye newe vsages and seide 
þat þei were profitable 
for a citee 
and vndede so 
þe olde lawes of þe contrey. 
Þanne þe doute is wel iaxed 
wheþer þe menyng of Ipodomus be good and Ʒif it is spedful ofte to chaunge lawes 
also þei we se lawes 
þat semeþ more profitable and bettre. 
And þe philosofer in Poleticorum makeþ foure resouns 
by þe whiche it semeþ ipreued 
þat it is spedful to chaunge lawes. 
First is itake by science and art, 
þe seconde by schrewednesse of som lawes, 
þe þridde by symplenesse of makers of lawes, 
þe ferþe by vncerteyn particuler circumstaunces. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
In oþer doynges we seen þat Ʒif þe lattere men seen 
þe bettere menyng, 
þe menyng of þe raþere men is reproued. 
As in phesik moche menyng of oolde men is forsake; 
and in craft of wrastelyng, 
as þe philosofer meneþ in Poletikys, 
many thinges þat olde men taugte ben renewed 
and ichaunged by newe men. 
Wherfore so he seith 
þat it scholde be in lawes 
þat Ʒif we seen bettere, 
lawes of contre scholde 
no lengere be hoolde. 
Þe seconde wey to preue 
þe same is itake 
by schrewednesse of som [lawes]. 
Lawes of contray may be euel 
as þe philosofer meneþ, 
as lawes of barbares; 
as som tyme among þe Grees 
was a lawe þat þei þat bare ire and oþer metal bouƷte 
wyues eche of oþer. 
And it is in alle wyse barbari 
and vnskylful to ordeyne lawes 
þat citeseyns myƷte selle here wyues. 
Also summe | lawes ben nyce as þe lawe 
þat þe philosofer meneþ and reherseþ 
þat som men made: 
þat Ʒif a citeseyn were islawe 
and eny of his kyn wolde rese on eny citeseyne, 
Ʒif þat citeseyn wolde flee 
for eny presumpcioun 
he scholde be holde gulty of þe deeþ. 
For þe makere of lawe seide 
þat he wolde not flee 
but assay hymself gilty. 
But it is folye to ordeyne suche lawe; 
for whether a man be gilty oþer no, 
Ʒif he drede to be wounded 
it is kyndeliche 
þat he flee ┌hem┐ þat ┌hym┐ purseweþ ‡. 
Þanne for som lawes of contrey ben schrewed and nyse, 
þei scholde be chaunged. 
Þe þridde wey is itake 
by symplenesse of makers of lawes. 
For som tyme makers of lawes 
ben symple men 
ofwitte and of cunnynge, 
þanne it were vnresonable but wise men 
þat comen afterward 
myƷte chaunge lawes of contrey 
þat ben imaad by symple men. 
Þanne in suche a caas lawes 
of oolde tyme scholde be changed. 
Þe ferþe is itake 
by vncerteyn particuler circumstaunces. 
For particuler dedes ben vncerteyne 
and mowe notbe parfitliche irekened, 
þerfore by þe makers of lawe neuere so wise, 
Ʒut som particuler circumstance of dedes of mankynde 
may be vnknowe to hem. 
Þanne Ʒif by cause of experience of particuler dedes newe men seen 
som what þat is bettere, 
it is not inconuenyent to putte of olde lawes 
of contrey for newe lawes 
þat ben bettre. 
And so it semeþ 
þat þes resons preuen 
þat as ofte as eny better 
þyng comeþ to mynde, 
lawes of contrey scholde be chaunged. 
But symple affirmyng herof 
is perilous to reg|ne and to citee; 
for as þe philosofer seith, ii Poleticorum, 
it is al oon to vse to brynge in newe lawes 
and to vse 
to be not obedient to lawes, 
for lawes hauen greet strengþe of vsage 
and it is hard to do aƷenst þyng 
þat is ivsed and iholde long tyme. 
And vsyng to be not obedient to lawes 
is vsyng to be not obedient to kynges and princes, 
and so it is destroyeng 
of principate of þe regne. 
And how gret harme Ʒif we be not obedient to princes 
þe philos- ofer preueþ, 
i Rethoricorum, 
and seith þat we doun more harme 
Ʒif we be not obedient to princes 
þan we don Ʒif we ben not obedient to phisicians, 
for phisicians desiren good and profit 
for þei willen hele þe body. 
But verrey Ʒeueres of lawe 
and verrey kynges desiren profit of þe soule 
and to brynge citeseyns to vertues. 
Þanne for to knowe 
what is þe holdynge 
in þe doute 
þat is iaxed, 
it is to wetynge 
þat Ʒif lawe positif is riƷtful, 
þei mot lenye 
on lawe of kynde 
and determyne particuler doynges. 
And suche a lawe may faille in tweye manere wise: first, 
Ʒif it is contrarie to lawe of kynde; 
þe 15 seconde, 
Ʒif it determyneþ 
not suffisauntliche particuler dedes. Ʒif positif lawes of contrey faillen 
in þe firste manere, 
þanne þei ben not lawe 
but corupcioun of lawes 
and þerfore 
þei scholde be not holde. 
For þey5 positif lawes be ido to lawes of kynde, 
Ʒut þey ben not contrarie to lawes of kynde 
but we wolde clepe contrarie 
to lawe of kynde 
what is not Ʒift of kynde 
but ido þerto and ifounde 
by crafte of men. 
By þe whiche manere of spekynge man 
is kyndeliche naked 
and cloþyng is aƷenst kynde, 
for to be icloþed 
and be naked semeþ contrarie. 
And legistres vsen þis maner of spekyng 
as it is iwrete, 
ex Instituta, De Iure Naturali, 
where it is iseid 
þat lawes of men 
ben contrarie to lawes of kynde. 
For by lawe of kynde 
alle men 
seþþe þe worlde was first ymaad were ibore fre. 
Þanne þraldom is aƷenste kynde, 
for it is not þe Ʒift of kynde 
but it is iordeyned 
by lawes 
for profit of men. 
But it is al oon to clepe so a þyng aƷenste kynde 
and to speke bostersliche, 
for þat is propreliche aƷenst kynde 
þat is aƷenst kynde resoun. 
For by cause of comyn profit of men þraldom is ibrouƷt in, 
as we preuede tofore in þe seconde book. 
Som men seruen oþere 
and ben obedient 
þei it be do to lawe of kynde 
as cloþynge 
is ido to þe naked body 
þat is ibrouƷt forþ by kynde. 
Natheles cloþynge 
is not aƷenste lawe of kynde for kynde resoun wiþseiþ it not. 
Þanne lawes þat faillen 
for þei ben schrewede 
oþer aƷenst lawe of kynde 
as þat lawe was 
þat citeseyns myƷte selle here wifes, 
and alle oþere lawes 
þat ben schrewede and vnriƷtful, 
scholde not be hoolde 
but destroyed and vndo. 
But Ʒif lawes failleþ for he determyneþ 
not completliche particuler dedes 
þei better lawes 
ben ifounde 
and more suffisaunt, 
it is not to vsynge tochaunge lawes. First, 
forsom tymein suchedoynge isdeseite, 
for beste lawes 
ben itrowed worst 
and most suffisaunt 
ben itrowed lest suffisaunt. 
Nathalees þey more suffisaunt lawe 
in som poynt be newe- liche ifounde, 
Ʒut olde lawes of contray scholde be holde; 
for þe more oon profite in oo side | 
in Ʒeuynge more suffisant lawe, 
þe more he anoyeþ in anoþer side, 
bynemynge þerof vsage of longe tyme 
by þe 5 
whiche lawe haþ greet strengþe. 
Þanne it is not iliche of art and of lawes, 
for art and science hauen al here strengþe of resoun; 
but lawes not so, 
but hauen strengþe of vsage of long tyme. 
Þanne kynges and princes scholde kepe and hoolde good vsages of principate and of regne 
and [not] of chaungyng 
of lawes of contrayes 
but þei ben contrarie to riƷtful resoun. Chapter XXXI[I 
In matere of rewelyng of regne and cite, 
as it is iseid tofore, 
foure were to tretyng: 
what manere man a kyng 
oþer a prince scholde be, 
what counsaillours, what iuges, 
and what manere puple. 
Þanne for þe þre ben isped, 
it is to spekynge of þe ferþe 
þat is þe puple. 
But for to knowe what manere puple 
þe puple scholde be 
and how þei scholde bere hemself to þe prince, 
it helpeþ gretliche to wete and knowe 
what is a cite 
and what is a regne. 
It is oure entente 
to declare in þis chapitre 
what is a citee 
and what is a regne ‡. 
For euery man may wel wete 
þat houses makeþ toun and townes maken þe regnes. 
And it is to wetynge þat þeiƷ a citee be in som wise som what kyndelich for we hauen kynde desire to make a citee, 
it is not a cite imade 
noþer ibulde [but] 
by wit and work of mankynde. 
And þynges þat ben imaad be work of mankynde 
and ben iknowe by þe ende 
and profit for þe whiche it is iordered. 
And principaliche we knowen 
what is an hous 
Ʒif we knowen 
þat it is imaad 
for þis profitable ende 
for to defende vs fro reyne, 
fro coold, 
and fro heete. 
Wherfore Ʒif we wolle knowe 
what is a citee, 
þe profites wherfore | it serueþ to bulde a cite scholde be rekened 
and it scholde be knowe whiche 
is þe cheef profit 
among þilke profites. 
And þe philosofer, [iii] Poleticorum, 
discreueþ what is a citee 
and rekeneþ sex profites 
wherfore a citee is iordeyned. 
For first, a citee is iordeyned 
for communicacioun of place 
þat men mowe wonye togedre. 
For þerof ‡ comeþ likynge and murþe, 
for withoute companye no man haþ murþe of possessioun. 
For Ʒif a man hadde moche gold and seluer 
and alle manere vitailles and leuede wiþoute companye so 
þat oþir men knowe not his richesse 
noþer he miƷt comyn his richesse to oþer men, 
þei wolde not telle gret pris of his richesse. 
Þan cite is imaad for men 
scholde dwelle togeders 
in oon place and lyue in murþe 
and in likynge. 
Þe seconde, 
a citee is imaad not onliche 
for to lyue in murþe 
and in likynge, 
but for þe silue lyuynge. 
For men þat ben in þe same citee seruen eche oþer 
to þe lif 
and eche helpeþ oþer in þynges 
þat nedeþ to þe lif. 
Þe þridde, 
a citee is imaad for defence 
and for to putte of wrong. 
For oon man leuynge solitarie lif is not suffisant to wiþstonde enemyes 
and to voide wrong 
þat hym is idoo, 
a citee is imaad: 
for oon þat lyueþ solitarie lif may not defende hymsilf fro enemyes. 
Yf he is part of þe multitude of þe citee, 
he may lyue saufliche and wiþoute drede. 
Þe ferþe, 
a citee is iordeyned 
for chaungynge 
and for contractes. 
For it is iseide tofore 
þere we tretede of lawes 
þat chaungynges and contractes ben imaad 
by þe lawe 
þat hatte ius gencium, 
and makynge of chaungynges 
and contractes longeþ propreliche to mankynde. 
And for no man [haþ] alle | thinges þat nedeþ to þe lif 
but he chaunge som thinges 
þat he haþ for thinges 
þat ben not, 
þerfore byggyng and sellyng, 
chaungynges and contractes, 
ben nedful and ben alle 
þe eslichere ido Ʒif men dwellen ifere. 
Þerfore a citee is imaad 
for men scholde dwelle ifere. 
Þe fifte profit 
wherfore a citee is imaad is communicacioun of wedlok. 
For men þat wonyen togeders 
ben frendes and louen 
þe bettre eche oþer, 
oþer for som oþer good 
þat þei seen come þerof, 
a‡ maken contracte of mariages and ben alyes. 
Þe sexte profit wherfore a citee is imaad is free and vertuous leuynge. 
For þei mowe bettere ponysche hem 
þat trespassen and ben euel doers 
Ʒif þei wonyen ifeere in a citee 
þanne þei myƷte an‡ þei wonyed disparpuled and ladde solitarie lyf, 
þanne þerfore it is 
þat manye leuen euel doynge 
and vsen good workes 
and doynge for drede of payne; 
and in þat doynge 
þei ben disposed 
to bee good men and vertuous, 
for vertues and vertuous dedes ben most good. 
Þei [for] alle þe forsayde profites 
in som wyse a citee is imaad, 
Ʒut a citee is pri[ncipal]liche imaad 
for free and vertuous leuynge. 
Wherfore Ʒif of þe moste þe cheef ende 
and of þe most profit 
þat is desired 
in a þyng knowynge is itake, 
it is wel iseid, iii Poleticorum, 
þat nyƷ place, comunicacioun of wedlok, deffence, chaungynge of thinges, 
and of oþere suche ben þe thinges 
withoute þe whiche a citee scholde not be. 
Nathalees a citee is principalliche imaad 
for to lyuye wel and vertuous and in felicitee. 
Þanne Ʒif me axeþ 
what is a citee, 
it schal be seid 
þat it is comunicacioun of citeseyns | 
for to lyue wel and vertuouslyche 
and for profit 
and by itself suffisaunt lyuynge. For it is iknowe wat is a citee, 
it may be sone iknowe what is a regne. 
For a regne passeþ 
a citee 
in multitude of gentel men and noble. 
And a citee 
is a partye of a regne, 
and in a regne ben mo gentil men and noble þan in a citee. 
Þanne a regne may be discreued 
in þis wise – 
þat it is a greet multitude 
in þe whiche ben manye gentil men and noble, 
leuynge by vertue, 
ordeyne vnder oon þe beste, 
as vnder a kyng. 
And leuynge by vertues [is] 
þe ende principaliche desired in eche cite- seyn 
and in eche citee 
and in þe hoole regne. 
For þe philosofer seith þat þe same is þe ende of on citeseyn 
and of al þe hoole [citee, 
we may saye þatþe same is of on citee 
and of al þe hoole] regne. 
For a verrey kyng 
and a riƷtful schal desire þe same ende 
in oon citeseyn 
and in al þe hoole citee 
and in al þe hoole regne. 
For þei scholde besiliche studie 
þat a citeseyne leuye vertuousliche 
and þat al þe hoole citee be vertuous 
and þat al þe hool regne be good and vertuous. 
But Ʒif eche citeseyne scholde be vertuous, 
moche more a kyng scholde be vertuous. 
For þe philosofer seith, iii Poleticorum, 
þat as a kyng passeþ 
oþere men in myƷt and in dignite, 
so þei scholde passe hem in good- nesse and in vertue. 
Þanne gentil men 
and noble scholde 
be more vertuous 
þan oþere men. 
Þerfore þe kyng hymself 
as most excellent of alle scholde be þe beste and an half god. 
And þerfore it is þat regne 
is icleped a multitude 
in þe whiche ben manye gentel men 
and noble not leuynge in al maner wise but leuynge by vertue and ordeyne | 
vnder oon man 
þat is best as vnder a kyng. 
For it is declared 
what is a citee 
and what is a regne, 
it may be sone iknowe what puple scholde be in þe regne and in a citee. 
For Ʒif citee and regne is iordeyned 
for good lif and vertuous, 
þe puple of þe regne scholde be good and vertuous. 
Þerfore þe philosofer seith, iii Poleticorum, 
þat he is more verrey citeseyn 
þat haþ many good workes and vertuous 
þan he þat haþ greet richesse and noble kyn 
and oþer out-ward good. 
And manye trowen 
þat þei ben citeseyns of þe regne Ʒif þei hauen 
in þe regne manye hous and greet possessioun; 
but þei ben more verreyliche of þe regne 
þat doþ manye good dedes and vertues and holdeþ riƷtful lawes and statutes of þe regne þanne þei þat hauen noble kyn and cyuel myƷt 
and power 
and moche outward good. Chapter XXXII[I Qvarto Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer seith þat in a citee mot be þre partees, 
for som ben ful riche 
and somme ful poore 
and somme mene men. 
And in þis wise as a citee is deuyded in þre parties, 
so may eche puple 
and eche regne ‡ be deuyded. 
Þe entencioun of þis chapitre 
is to declare þat a citee is best 
and a regne is best Ʒif among þe puple 
þerof bene manye mene persones. 
And, iiii Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer toucheþ foure 
by þe whych may be tak iiii weyes to preue 
þat politik is þe bettere 
and a regne is þe better 
and a cite is þe bettere Ʒif 
þerin ben mani mene persones. 
Þe firste wey is itake 
for suche puple leuen þe more resonabliche. 
Þe seconde, for among hem scholde be þe more loue. 
Þe þridde, 
for þer is þe more | equite. 
Þe ferþe, 
for þer is þe lasse envye 
and þe lasse despisyng. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For Ʒif in þe puple 
is many ful poore 
and many ful riche 
and fewe mene persones, 
vnneþe or neuere þei leuen resonablelyche. 
For ful riche men 
conne not bere hemself resonableliche 
to ful pore men, 
for þei greuen hem openliche for litel occasioun. 
Also ful pore men cunne not bere hemself resonabliche to ful riche men 
for þei leyen in awaite in what wise þei mowe sleliche and preueyliche stele heere good and catel. 
But Ʒif þer be in þe puple manye mene persones, 
suche greef ceseþ 
and þei ben sone obedient to resoun. 
And so it is iseid, 
iiii Poleticorum, 
þat for mene is best, 
mene is best possessioun 
for it is sone obedient to resoun. 
For Ʒif on partie of a citee 
is passyng gentil and noble and passyng myƷty 
and passyng riche 
and þe oþer partie contrarieþ 
þerto is passynge nedy 
and passynge feble 
and swyþe vnworthi, 
it is hard to folwe resoun. 
For þe passyng myƷty men wolde do wrong to þe pore men, 
<and> þe pore men 
ben ful wikked and gileful 
and lyen priueyliche 
on awayte on riche men. 
Þe seconde wey is itake by comune loue 
þat scholde be bytwene hem 
þat ben in þe regne 
or in þe same cytee. 
For as it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
þe pore men louen not þe princes 
and myƷti men and riche, 
and þis is ful greuous to a cytee 
as it is iseid þere. 
Þanne for to haue 20 
loue bytweyne citeseyns, 
it is good þat among þe puple 
ben manye mene persones. 
Þe þridde wey | 
is itake by equite and riƷtwisnesse 
þat scholde be kepte 
in þe citee. 
For as þe philosofer seith, 
þei þat passen in fortune, 
in myƷt, in richesse, 
and in frendschipe, 
and in oþer suche good 
connen not be soget. 
And þei þat ben passynge 
nedy conneþ not be princes. 
Wherfore Ʒif in þe puple 
ben onliche twey parties, 
to pore and to riche and fewe oþere non mene persones 
it is hard to kepe equyte and riƷtwisnesse; 
but þe riche wolleþ alwey be princes 
and ouersette þe oþere, 
and þe oþere aƷenward fondeþ 
to make discencioun and strif. 
And Ʒif it happe 
þat pore men ben princes, 
for þei konneþ not be princes, 
þei wollen trete wel euel 
þe riche men and myƷty. 
Þe ferþe wey is itake 
for to putte of enuye and despite. 
For as it is iseid, 
iiii Poleticorum, 
pore men hauen most enuye 
to riche men 
and riche men 
hauen most despit of pore men, 
and [none] companye may dure 
þere is greet enuye and despit. 
Wherfore þe puple is best Ʒif 
þerinne ben manye mene persones, 
for þanne þei lyuen togedres resonabliche and louyen eche oþer and kepen 
among hem equite and riƷtwisnesse. 
And noon enuye is among hem noþer despit, 
for noon haþ cause to despite oþer noþer to haue enuye to oþer, 
seynge þat he is 
as it were his peere 
and among hem oon passeþ not gretliche anoþer. 
And to þis soþnesse acordeþ þe loore 
þat Saloun and Carendas and Ligurigus techeþ of polecies, 
for þei seide þat policies 
and comyntee scholde be ordeyned of mene persones. 
Þanne kynges and princes scholde ordeyne þat in þe regne scholde | 
be manye mene persones 
lest som men be to pore 
and somme to riche. 
And þat may be Ʒif þe citeseyns scholde not for eche cause selle here fader poscessions noþer for eche cause bygge possessions. 
Ʒif good heede is bysiliche itake of byggyng 
and sellynge of fildes, 
som manere equite may be kepte among citeseyns. f. 159v 5 Chapter XXX[IV 
As it longeþ to þis doynge þe puple haþ þre Ʒif he is with greet besi- nesse obedient to kynges and princes and kepeþ and holdeþ lawes of kynges, 
of þe whiche þre by þre weyes we may preue how profitable and spedful it is to þe puple to be obedient to kynges 
and to kepe here lawes. 
And first, þerby þe puple haþ vertues 
and most good and profit. 
Þe seconde, 
þerof comeþ sauacioun of regne and of citee. 
Þe þridde, 
þerof comeþ pees and ese of citeseyns 
and plente of outward þynges. 
Þe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For, 
as it is iseid tofore, 
his entencioun þat makeþ lawe 
is for to brynge citeseyns to vertue. 
And as þe philosofer meneþ, 
iiii Poleticorum, circa principium, 
þe same is þe vertue 
of a good citeseyn 
and of a good man. 
And by þe same doynge and by þe same þewes a man is a good citeseyn and a good man. 
And a man is a good citeseyn 
Ʒif he is obedient to þe prince 
and to hym þat Ʒeueþ lawes. 
Wherfore Ʒif þe prince rewleþ his puple ariƷt, 
for his entent is to brynge oþere men to vertu for vertue makeþ a man good 
and his work good, 
it nedeþ in riƷtful rewelyng 
þat a good citeseyn be a good man; 
and he þat is wel obedient 
to þe kyng is a good man. 
And | Ʒif þe kyng desireþ 
not þat his sogettes ben gode and vertuous, 
þan he is no kyng 
but a tyrant. 
Þanne Ʒif eche citesein scholde desire 
to be good and vertuous, 
for vertues ben most good, 
þei schold with most besynesse studie to be obedient to þe kyng 
and to be so ware 
þat he brek not his lawes 
and his hestes. 
And to al men 
boþe worthi and vnworthi þe kynges 
obedience is nedful 
and kepyng of lawes. 
And þe more semelich it is þat noble men ben good and vertuous, 
þe more spedful it is 
þat þei be obedient to kynges 
and kepe þe lawes. 
Þe seconde wey to preue þe same is itake 
for of þe kynges obedience 
and of kepyng of lawes 
comyþ sauacion of regne and of cite. 
For it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
þat in lawes is sauacioun of citees. 
And som men trowen 
þat kepyng of lawes 
is a certeyn þraldome. 
But þe philosofer, 
v Poleticorum, 
seith þat [it is no þraldom but fredom. 
For men knoweþ not fredom 
þat sayen þat kepe lawes 
and] be obedient to kynges 
is [‡] þraldom. 
And for bestes ben of þral kynde, 
þe more a man draweþ to bestial 
kynde he is þe more kyndeliche þral. 
And þe philosofer meneþ and Homerus also þat he þat is euel doere and desireþ werre and disturbleþ 
þe pees and wol lyue withoute souereyne and withoute lawe 
is more verreyliche 
a beest þan a man. 
Wherfore he þat kepeþ not lawes 
noþer wol be obedient to lawes 
and to souereynes 
ben more verreyliche beestes þan men, 
[and þerby suche ben more þral þan free]. 
Also sauacioun is isaued, 
and men of þe regne ben imaad free Ʒif þei ben obedient to kynges 
and kepeþ þe lawes. 
How greet sauacioun springeþ 
in þe regne of þe kynges obedience it is declared atte fulle Ʒif þe wordes of þe philosofer, 
iiii Poleticorum, 
ben iknowe þat likneþ þe kyng to þe regne 
as | þe soule to þe body. 
For as þe soule rewleþ and saueþ þe body, 
so þe kyng rewleþ and saueþ þe regne. 
And as þe soule is sauacion and lif of þe body, 
so a riƷtful kyng is sauacion and lif of þe regne. 
Wherfore [as it is] worst to þe body 
[to] 
forsake þe [soule] 
and not be rewled þerby, 
so it is worst to þe regne 
to forsake kynges lawes 
and heeste of lawes and not be rewled by þe kyng. f. 160r 10 Þe þridde wey to preue þe same is itake for [of] þe kynges obedience 
and of kepynge of lawes springeþ pees and ese of citeseyns 
and plente of outward þynges. 
For, 
as it is iseid tofore, lawes and makers of lawes and kyng and prince hauen power 
to compelle and constrayne hem 
þat wolle not for loue of honeste noþer for wamynge noþer for reprouynge of fader and moder noþer of oþere frendes withdrawe hem 
fro euele dedes, 
þei scholde wiþdrawe hem þerfro nameliche for drede. 
And it is spedful to regne and cyte to haue a kyng oþer a prince leste euel doers 
disturble pees of citeseyns. 
And eche makere of lawe scholde desire 
þat citeseyns haue ese of herte 
and þat þei leue in pees 
and by oon assent. 
And þerfore it is þat þe philosofer, 
primo Rethoricomm, 
wol mene þat as makers of lawe hauen hem to þe soules 
as phisicians hauen hem to þe bodyes. 
For as phisicians desiren to abate humoures 
lest siknesse come þerof in þe body, 
so þe makere of lawe desireþ 
to plese þe hertes 
and sowles for strif and discord scholde not arise in regne noþer in citee. 
And þerfore it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricomm, 
þat he | þat haþ trespassed aƷenst hestes of þe phisician doþ 
not so greet synne 
as he 
þat vseþ 
to be not obedient to þe prince. 
For þe soule is bettre þan þe body, 
and pees of citeseyns 
and of hem 
þat ben in þe regne 
is better þanne euennesse of humours 
oþer heele of bodies. 
Þanne with most besynesse þe puple 
and alle men of þe regne scholde be obedient to þe kyng and kepe lawes, 
for þerof comeþ so greet good and profit 
as is pees and ese of hem 
þat ben in þe regne. 
Also þerof comeþ plente of outward thinges. 
For Ʒif þer is werre in þe regne, 
lond is vnteeled 
and þer is ryflyng and robberye 
and lond is bareyne 
and men of þe regne 
ben imaad pore and nedy. 
Ʒif þanne it is iknowe 
how greet profit comeþ 
to regne of a kyng, 
not oonliche to riƷtful kynges 
but also þei he do som tyraundise, 
Ʒut þe puple scholde be obedient to hem. 
For som what of tyraundise 
may be bettre isuffred 
þan þe harm þat comeþ Ʒif men ben vnobedient 
to þe prince 
and breken his lawe. Chapter XXX[V 
After þat we hauen itaugt þe puple 
and alle men of a regne 
to be obedient to kynges 
and to kepe here lawes, 
in þis chapitre we wolle 5 declare how men of a regne scholde bere hemself 
so þat kynges be not meued 
to wrathe aƷenst hem. 
Þe philosofer, 
in principio [ii] Rethoricorum, 
seith þat wrathe is sorwe comyng of appetite of semynge ponysschyng, 
for semynge despite of hem 
þat hauen mysbore hem to hym, 
oþer to som of his. 
For neuere is wrathe wiþoute som manere sorwe. 
And he þat is | wrooþ desireþ to ponysche oponliche hem 
þat despisen hym, 
oþer som of his, 
oþer eny thing 
þat longeþ to hym in eny wise. 
Þanne as þe philosofer seith, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
whanne a man is sory aƷenst anoþer 
in eny of þees 
forseide maneres be desire of ponyschyng, 
it is iseid 
þat he is wrooþ. 
Also citeseyns, 
for þei scholde not meue kynges to wrathe, 
þei scholde not trespace aƷenste þe kyng, 
noþer aƷenst his, 
noþer aƷenste thinges 
þat longeþ to hym in eny wise. First, 
it is spedful to hem 
þat ben in þe regne, 
for þei scholde not offende þe kyng, 
to do no trespas aƷenst þe kyng. 
For tweyne ben thewe to þe kyng, 
worschep and obedience. 
For a kynge is an heed ilikned to oþere membres 
in twey manere wise. First, 
for he is heighere 
and more excellent þan oþere. 
Þe seconde, 
for þei rewelen oþere 
in workes and in dedes. 
Also, 
for he makeþ lawes 
and for in a kyng scholde be wit and vnderstondynge; 
and to hym it longeþ most by hymself 
and by oþere to rewle hem þat ben in þe regne. 
Þanne for he is more excellent þan oþere, 
þei scholde haue worschep and reuerence; 
and for he rewleþ oþere, 
oþere scholde be sogette 
and obedient to hym. 
Wherfore þei 
þat ben in þe regne mowe trespace aƷenst þe kyng 
in twey manere wise. First, Ʒif þei doun hym not worschip and reuerence 
as þei scholde. 
Þe seconde, 
Ʒif þei ben not soget 
and obedient to hym 
kepyng his lawes and heestes. 
And whanne þes tweyne, 
worschep and obedience, 
ben wiþdrawe þe kyng, 
þanne he is skilfulliche wrooth. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þat we | ben wrooþ to hem 
þat were iwoned oþer iholde to do vs worschep 
Ʒif þei doun vs noon. 
And þe cause is for it semeþ 
þat þei þat doun so despisen vs. 
For Ʒif þei despisen vs not, 
þei wolde do vs worschep as þei scholde. 
Also þere it is iseyd 
þat we ben wrothe with lowere men 
Ʒif þei doun not 
as þei scholde 
and Ʒif þei doun 
oþer wise þanne þey scholde. 
And þat happeþ most Ʒif þei trespassen aƷenste hestes of souereynes 
and ben not obedient to þe kyng. 
20 
For it is iknowe how men of þe regne scholde not meue þe kyng to wrathe – trespassynge aƷenst hym, 
not doynge hym worschip and obedience 
as þei scholde – it is to declarynge 
how þey scholde not meue hym to wrothe trespassynge aƷenste hem 
þat ben his and longeþ to hym. 
And to hym longeþ diuerse persons, 
fader and moder 
and al his kyn, 
wif and children and sogettes. 
Also Ʒif men of þe regne 
wolle not meue þe kyng to wrathe, 
þei scholde not onliche not trespace aƷenst hemself 
but also þei scholde not trespace aƷenst his kyn, wif, children, 
noþer aƷenst his sogettes. 
And for alle þat ben in þe regne ben soget to þe kyng, 
it is trespace aƷenst þe kyng 
as ofte as eny in þe regne 
haþ eny wrong. 
And so it is iseide, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
capitulo De Ira, 
þat we ben wrothe wiþ hem 
þat trespassen to oure fader and moder, children, wyues, and sogettes, 
for it is schame 
but we helpe hem. 
Þe þridde, 
men of þe lond 
scholde not trespasse in þynges 
þat ben iordeyned 
to þe kyng 
in eny manere wyse, 
and suche þynges ben his owne possessions 
and riƷtes of þe regne. 
For a kyng is meued to | 
wrethe aƷenst hem 
þat bynemen rigtes of þe regne for in 
þat it semeþ 
þat þei despisen þe kyng Ʒif þei setten hond in thinges 
þat longeþ to hym wrongfulliche 
and withoute his owne heste. 
Þanne alle citeseyns 
and.alle þe men of þe regne scholde in child-hood teche here children to louye þe kyng 
and to do hym worschepe 
and to be obedient to hym 
and not trespace 
to his kyn noþer to his children 
noþer to oþer persones 
þat ben sogettes 
to hym noþer 
in rigtes of þe regne. 
For it is iseid, v Poleticorum, 
þat worst it is Ʒif children 
ben not itaugt to vertue 
and to kepe good lawes 
and to holde poyntes 
þat ben iordeyned in rewelyng of þe regne 
in þe whiche þei ben inne. 
For alwey we louen þe firste moste, 
and children ben most inclined 
to holde best þynges 
þat þey lemen first. Chapter XXXV[I 
For in þe firste book we byhiƷte þat we wolde speke 
how kynges and princes scholde bere hemself 
for to be loued of þe puple 
and how for to be dradde, 
heere we wol trete how and in what wise 
þat may be doo. 
And so it is to wetynge 
þat to make kynges and princes comynliche be loued of þe puple 
þre nedeþ principalliche. Firste, 
þat þei ben fre of Ʒiftes and liberal. 
Þe seconde, 
þat þei be stalworthe and worschepful. 
Þe þridde, 
þat þei be riƷtful. 
Þe firste is declared in þis wise. 
For þe comune puple faren 
as þei han perseyued not but sencible good, 
and louyen and worschepen hem 
þerfore þat 
Ʒe|uen Ʒiftes and ben liberal 
and Ʒeuen money and monyes worth. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricomm, capitulo De Amore, 
þat þe puple loueþ 
and worschepeþ hem 
þat Ʒeueþ Ʒiftes and moneye and ben liberal. 
Þe seconde, 
for to be loued of þe puple kynges scholde be fortes, stalworthe, and magnanimi, 
and putte hemself 
Ʒif it nedeþ to peril 
for þe comyn profit 
and for þe defence of þe regne. 
For þe puple louen wel stalworthe men 
and worschepful 
þat putteþ hemself to peril 
for þe comyn profit and trowen 
þat here sauacioun [comeþ] be suche men. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þat we louen hem 
þat Ʒeuen Ʒiftes to sauacioun 
and hem þat mowe do vs good and saue vs and delyuery vs. Þerfore we louyen men 
þat ben stalworde and bolde. 
Þe þridde, 
for to be loued of þe puple 
kynges scholde be riƷtful. 
For þe puple is most imeued to hate Ʒif þei seen 
þat þe kyng is not riƷtful. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þat we louyen riƷtful men best. 
For it is iknowe how kynges and princes scholde bere hemself 
for to be loued of þe puple, 
it is to tretynge how þei scholde bere hemself 
to be drad of þe puple. 
And as it is iseid, [ii] Rethoricorum, princes ben most idrad for ponyschyng 
þat þei vsen in sogettes. 
And in ponyschyng 
þre mote be knowe: 
þe peyne silf, 
þe persone þat is iponysched, 
[and] þe manere of ponyschyng. 
Touchinge þe payne, 
kynges and princes ben idrad Ʒif 
þei peynen hym cruelliche 
þat disturblen þe regne | 
ouer mesure and þe policie and rewelyng. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þat men dreden hem 
þat [þei] trowen 
þat vsen to do here doynge [hard] and cruel. f. 161v 20 Þe seconde, kynges and princes ben idrad not oonliche for þe peyne 
þat þey Ʒeuen but also for þe persones 
þat ben iponysched. 
For by cause of riƷtwisnesse þe riƷtful man scholde no man spare. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
vii Poleticorum, 
þat he þat doþ wel spareth no man; 
for not for fader noþer for sone noþer 
for frend noþer for oþer scholde men spare to do wel. 
And kynges and princes ben ydrad 
by cause of persones 
þat ben yponysched 
whanne þei sparen not frendes noþer 
oþer Ʒif þei trespassen, 
for þanne eche of þe puple dredeþ 
to trespace and þynkeþ 
þat þey may not scape þe peyne. 
But as þe philosofer meneþ, 
vii Poleticorum, for kynges scholdebe þe moreidrad 
and kepeþe more strongliche riƷtwisnesse, 
kynges and princes scholde ponysche more cruelliche here owne frendes Ʒif þei doun greet trespace þan oþere men. 
Þe þridde, kynges and princes ben idrad 
for þe manere of ponyschyng. 
And þat may be whan here iuges and officers beren hemself 
so warlich and preueyliche 
in ponyschyng 
and in doynge riƷt 
þat mysdoers 
mowe not scape 
but þei ben iponysched. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
þat þei þat ben preuey ben more idra[d] 
þan þei þat [ben] not preuey. 
For it is iknowe how kynges and princes scholde bere hemself 
for to be loued 
and how for to be drad, 
it may be sone iknowe 
þat þey eyƷþer be nedful, 
Ʒut kynges and princes scholde more desire to be | 
iloued þan idrad. 
And it is iseid tofore 
þat þe principal entent 
of a kyng 
and of eche prince 
scholde be for to brynge 
oþere men in vertue. 
And eche good doynge 
by þe whiche citeseyns 
ben þe more good and vertuous 
scholde be þe more desired 
of þe makere of lawe. 
Þanne Ʒif for citeseyns and men 
þat ben in þe regne don wel and kepe þe lawes and heestes of þe kyng for loue of honeste 
and of þe comyn profit and of þe kyng, 
ben more goode and vertuous 
þanne he dede soo for drede of peyne, 
kynges and princes scholde more desire 
for to be loued of þe puple þan idrad; 
for it is more nedful to þe puple to do wel 
and leue euel for loue 
þan for drede of peyne. co1. 
And eyþer is nedful – 
to be drad and iloued – 
for not alle ben so good and parfit 
þat þey wollen leue euel doynge onliche for loue of honest and of þe comyn profit and of þe makere of lawe 
þat desireþ þe comyn profite. 
Þanne som men mote be brouƷte to goode and wiþdrawe 
fro euel by drede of peyne. 
Naþalees bettere it 
is to be loued þan idrad, 
as it is declared tofore. Book III Part III DOI: 10.4324/9781315861739-202

and what manere men scholde be sette ouer hors men and foot men. 
What cautels scholde þe duk of bataile vse so þat his oost be not igreued

Ʒif we scholde fiƷte aƷenste enemyes. 
They scholde be sent to bataille 
þat smyteth drawyng; 
and better it is to smyte foynyng. 
What þynges 
and how manye maken enemyes þe more myƷti; 
and in how manye manere wise we scholde rese on enemyes. 
In what manere alle fiƷtynge men scholde stonde Ʒif þei wollen smyte þe enemyes;

and in what manere þei scholde wiþdrawe Ʒif 
it is not good for to fiƷt. 
How manye maneres þer ben of batailes;

How men of þe sege scholde strengþe hemself;

Capitulum primum tercii libri partis iii. Chapter I 
For þis twey parties of þis þridde book ben isped and it is declared 
what olde philosofres wolde mene 
in rewelyng of citee and of regne 
and also it is declared how cite and regne scholde be rewled 
in tyme of pees, 
now it is to tretyng of dedes of bataille 
þat kynges and princes mowe wete and knowe 
in what manere wise bataylles scholde be igeue. 
And Vigesius, 
in libro De Re Mylitari, 
seith þat comynliche wit 
and sleithe in bataille helpeþ more 
to haue þe victorie 
þan doþ multitude 
oþer strengþe of fiƷtynge men. 
And dedes of bataille ben conteyned vnder chiualrie 
as it schal be declared heere after. 
Wherfore Ʒif we wolle trete of dedes of bataille, 
it is to wetynge 
what is chiualrie 
and whereto it is iordeyned. 
Þanne it is to wetynge 
what is þe craft of cheualrie; 
it is a manere of prudencia, wisedom, 
oþer a maner kynde partie of wisdom. 
And as it longeþ 
to þis doyng 
we may distingue íyue manere of wisdomes: 
synguler wisedom, 
wisdome of housbondrie, 
wisdom of regne, 
wisdome of polecie and of rewelyng 
þat is wisdom of cyuel, 
and wisdom of chiualrie. 
And it is iseid 
þat man haþ singuler wisdom 
whanne he can rewle hymself; and þat is lasse wisdome 
þan wisdom of housbandrie 
oþer of regnynge, 
for it is lasse to a kyng 
to kunne rewle hymself þanne it is to kunne rewle manye, 
oþer regne oþer cite. 
Þe seconde manere of wisdom 
is wisdom of housbondrie. 
For as it is iseid, 
vi Ethicorum, 
þe wise man is icleped prudens 
for he can geue good counsaile 
and rewle to good ende. 
Þanne where is diuers manere good, 
þere is diuers manere of wisdome. 
Þanne for good of hous and comyne good of 
þe hoole manye is oþer 
þan eny singuler good, 
wisdoom of housbondrie 
by þe whiche a man can rewle hous 
and manye mot be oþer þan wisdom 
by þe whiche a man can rewle hymself. 
Þe þridde manere of wisdom [is] of regnyng oþer of settyng of lawes. 
For as oo singuler persone is a partie of an hous, 
so an hous is a partie of a citee and of a regne. 
| And as good of an hous 
is oþer þan þe good of a singuler persone, 
so þe good of an hool citee 
and of a regne 
is oþer þan þe good of an hous. 
Þanne wisdome of regnynge and of settynge of lawes 
þat nedeþ in a kyng 
and in eche prince 
þat scholde geue lawe and rewle regne and citee is oþer þanne wisdom of housbondrie 
þat nedeþ in an housebonde 
þat schal rewle hous and mayne. 
And in so moche as þe good of citee 
and of þe regne passeþ 
þe good of hous 
and þe good of a singuler persone, 
by so moche þe wisdom 
þat nedeþ in a kyng scholde passe þe wisdom 
of an housebonde 
and þe wisdome of a singuler persone. 
Wherfore it is wel iseid 
þat Vigesius seith, in libro De Re Militari, 
þat no man schulde kunne more, 
noþer beter, 
noþer mo thinges 
þan a prince, 
for his lore may be profit 
to alle þe sogettes. 
And þerfore in techinge of kynges 
and of princes 
we deuyden and delen þis hoole book in þre bookes. 
For in þe firste book we taugte þat kynges and princes 
scholde be wise and redy 
as a kyng and a prince 
is a certeyne persone in hymself 
and as þei scholde rewle hymself. 
And in þe seconde book 
we taugte a kyng 
to be wise and redy 
and in þat he is housebonde and scholde spende þe good and cataille of his hous. 
And in þe þridde book 
a kyng 
is itaugt oþer a prince 
in þat he is heed of regne oþer 
of a principate 
and in þat þei scholde geue lawes 
and rewle citeseynes. 
And alle þes þre wisdomes 
a kyng scholde haue: particuler wisdom, 
wisdom of housbandrie, 
and wisdom of regnyng. 
Þe ferþe manere wisdome 
is icleped poletica and | ciuylis. 
For as in a prince nedeþ excellent wisdom 
by þe whiche he may cunne rewle oþere, 
so in eche citeseyn nedeþ 
som manere wisdome 
by þe whiche he may konne to holde þe lawes 
and heestes of þe prince. 
And a citeseyn serueþ 
not so a kyng oþer a prince 
as þe hamer serueþ a smyth, 
for in þe hamer 
is no knowynge 
but is onliche imeued of þe smyþ. 
But in a citee nedeþ 
som wisdom 
by þe whiche 
he may haue good opynyoun of þynges 
þat þe kyng hooteþ. 
And þis wisdom is oþer 
þan þe particuler wisdom 
þat we clepen þe firste manere wisdom, 
for it is oþer 
þat a man kunne rewle hemself 
in þat he is som what in hymself. 
Þanne it is to conne rewle hymsilf 
in þat he is sogette to a prince. 
For þei a man lede a solitarie lif, 
Ʒut hym nedeþ to haue som wisdom 
by þe whiche he may konne rewle hymself. 
Ʒut he haþ no ciuel wisdom 
noþer wisdom of housbondrie 
noþer of regnyng for he 
is no citee noþer partee of a citee. 
Þe fifte manere wisdom 
is icleped wisdom of chiualrie. 
For ristful rewlyng of regne and of citee 
is likned to þynges 
þat we seen in oon 
and þe same man. 
Þanne as eche man 
haþ twey vertues of þe soule, oon by þe whiche he comeþ 
to good and voydeþ harme and anoþer 
in þe whiche a reseþ 
and wiþstondeþ lettes, 
so eche citee and regne nedeþ 
twey vertues and twey manere of wisdomes 
– wisdomes of makynge of lawe and of cheualrie, 
so þat by wisdome of makynge of lawe 
þe hoole cyte 
and þe hoole regne 
may haue good and profit and voide greues, 
and | þat it may 
by wisdom of chiualrie 
and by dedes of armes rese and ouercome þynges þat letten. 
Þanne þe craft of cheualrie 
is a manere of wisdom 
by þe whiche enemyes ben ouercome and þei þat letten cyuel good and comyn profit. 
Herby it is iknowe wherfore chiualrie is iordeyned. 
For as it is declared tofor as lawes 
ben principalich iordeined for þe comyn profit, 
so cheualrie is principalich iordeined 
for to defende þe comyn prophite of cite and of regne. 
Þan for þe comyne profit 
is ilette 
by resyng of enemyes, 
and by þe consequent folwynge 
by strif arisyng of citeseyns, 
and by ouersettynge of feble persones, 
we may saye þat as it longeþ principaliche to hym 
þat is fortys to haue hym wel in dedes of armes and by þe consequent folwyng it longeþ to hym to haue hymself wel in oþer dredful thinges, 
so it longeþ principaliche to knyötes 
to haue hem wel 
in dedes of armes 
and by dedes of armes to putte of lettes of enemyes. 
And by þe consequent folwyng it longeþ to hem 
by heste of kyng and of prince 
to lette alle stryf 
and risyng of citeseyns 
and al ouersettynge of hem 
þat ben in þe regne 
by þe whiche ouersettynge pees of citeseyns 
and þe comyn profit myƷte be disturbled. 
And þis wisdom of chiualrie 
a kyng scholde principaliche haue. For þei fiƷtynge in bataile and puttyng of of lettes of þe comyn profit longeþ to knygtes 
and to hem to þe whiche kyng oþer prince wol graunte commyssioun, 
nathales how batailles scholde be Ʒeue 
and how warliche lettes of þe comyn profit 
may be put of, 
þe knowynge þerof | longeþ 
f. i63v principaliche to þe prynce. 
And herby it may be yknowe what men scholde be take to chiualrie. 
For chiualrie semeþ 
a manere wisdom of dedes of batailles 
yordeyned for þe comyn profit. 
For it semeþ 
þat in dedes of batailles 
knyƷtes ben ilikned to maistres and doctours in oþere science; 
wherfore as no man scholde be maad maister in oþer science 
but it be knowe 
þat he is wise 
and cunnynge in þat art, 
so no man scholde be take 
to þe dignitee of knyƷt 
but it be knowe 
þat he loue þe comyn profit of þe regne, 
but þer be hope 
þat he is good in dedes of batailles, 
and þat he wol 
at heeste of þe prince 
lette strif 
and risynge of citeseyns, 
and fiƷte for riƷtwisnesse, 
and lette wiþ al his myƷt al þyng 
þat may lette þe comyn profit. Herby it may be knowe 
þat alle dedes of batailles 
beþ conteyned vnder þe art of cheualrie; 
for þei hors men fiƷte and fot men 
þat ben no knyƷtes, 
Ʒut knyƷtes scholde be maistres in batailles 
and ordeyne oþere men in bataille. 
Þerfore it is iseid 
þat alle dedes of batailles 
ben conteyned vnder knyƷthood. 
And so herby it is iknowe 
þat for knyƷtes scholde be maisters of batailles, 
þei fiƷtynge in bataille longe to þe vertue 
þat hatte fortitudo, 
as it were stalworthnesse, 
Ʒut cheualrie is conteyned vnder wisdom, 
þat hatte prudencia. Chapter II As it longeþ to þis doynge tweyne semen nedful to dedes of batailles: 
strengþe for to fiƷte, 
and wisdom to rewle in batailles. 
Wherfore Ʒif we wolle knowe 
in what contreyes ben bestfiƷtyng men, 
it nedeþ to knowe þe forseyde tweyne. 
And in con|treys þat ben to nyƷ þe sonne 
scholde not fiƷtynge men be chose, 
for in hem faillen myƷt 
and boldenesse in bataille, 
as þe philosofer seith, 
vii Poleticorum. 
And Vigesius, primo libro De Re Militari, 
telleþ þe cause and seith 
þat naciouns 
þat ben nyƷ þe sonne 
ben dryed wiþ greet heet of þe sonne, and ben sleiƷ, 
but þei hauen but litel [bl]ood 
and hauen þerfore noþer stedefastnesse noþer trist in fiƷtynge 
for kyndelich þei dreden wondes. 
And for kyndeliche þei hauen litel [bl]ood, 
kyndelich þei dreden lost of [bl]ood. 
Þerfore þei ben not prest 
and redy to bataille noþer to strokes. 
Also in contrees 
þat beþ to fer norþ 
and to fer fro þe sonne scholde not fiƷtynge men be chose. 
For þei þei haue moche blood 
so þat þei dreden not woundes, 
Ʒut for moche blood 
þei ben to hasty and fool hardy, 
as it were wood and vnwise, 
and ben þerfore not al profitable 
to dedes of batailles. 
For in fiƷtynge, counsaile and wisdom 
is ful profitable. 
For we knowen by experience 
and þe philosofer seiþ pleynliche, 
vii Poleticorum, 
þat men þat ben to nyƷ 
þe sonne ben sclye 
and lacken boldenesse, 
and þei þat ben fer 
fro þe sonne passen in boldenesse and lakken wisdom. 
Þanne Ʒif boþe wisdome 
and boldenesse 
ben nedful in batailles, 
of noþere contree scholde fiƷtynge men be chose, 
but of mene contreye 
þat is not to fer 
fro þe sonne noþer to nyƷ þerto so 
þat þei ben boþe wyse and bolde. 
But it is to wetynge 
þat suche lore schulde be take 
as it fareþ comynliche, 
for in eche contree ben som men wise and bolde. 
Nathalees comynliche 
þeyƷ þat ben nyƷ þe sonne lackeþ boldenesse 
and þei þat ben fer þerfro lackeþ wisdom. 
Also it is to wetyng 
þat þei boþe booldenesse 
and wisdome 
ben nedful in bataille, 
Ʒut boldenesse is þe more profitable. 
Þerfore Ʒif men þat bien nyƷ þe sonne and men þat ben fer þerfro 
ben not profitable 
to dedes of bataille, 
but men of mene contrees scholde be chose, 
nathales among men 
of mene contrees men þat ben fer fro þe sonne scholde be rather ichose to bataille þanne men þat ben nyƷ to þe sonne for to haue þe more boldenesse. 
For it is iknowe 
in what contreys ben best fiƷtyng men, 
þynges þat nedeþ in fiƷtyng men schal be rekened 
þat we may knowe what manere men 
scholde be chose to bataille 
and of what craftes. 
Þanne it is to wetynge 
þat for fiƷttyng men 
scholde haue limes able and ivsed to smytyng and scholde not drede schedyng of blood, 
but þei scholde be bolde and hardy 
for to rese and fiƷte and myƷty and strong for to suffri traueille, 
we may seye þat smeþes and carpunters 
ben good to deedes of bataille, 
for by craft here armes ben able and ivsed to smytynge. 
Also bouchers ben able þerto, 
for þei dreden not schedyng of blood 
for þei ben ivsed to slauƷt of beestes 
and to schedyng of blood. 
Also hunters of boores 
scholde be take 
to suche dedes, 
for wiþoute greet hardinesse no man reseþ 
and assailleþ boores. 
Þanne suche men ben strong and orpede to fiƷte. 
And on cas it is no lasse perel to fiƷte 
with a boor þanne wiþ an enemy; 
þerfore Ʒif oon dredeþ not þe perels of a boor, 
it is a tokene 
þat þei dreden not batailles of enemyes. 
Also hunters of hertes 
scholde not be a|counted in dedes of batailles, 
for suche hunters vsen to greet trauaille. 
For thinges þat we hauen iseid, 
of þes craftes fiƷtynge men scholde be chose. 
Ʒif me taken heede 
of here owne craft, 
barbours and sowters and taillours 
and oþere sewers ben vnprofitable to fiƷte. 
For þey scholde neuere wel braundische 
and schake a maas noþer a swerd 
þat scholde haue a liƷt hond 
and is not ivsed to handely 
but a rasour 
oþer a nedle; 
for what is þe proporcioun of an nedele 
to a spere oþer of a rasour to a maas? 
Also apotecaries, spicers, fyschers and foulers 
scholde not be chose 
to suche dedes, 
for here craft accordeþ not to dedes of armes. 
But it may happe þat in eche craft 
ben sum wel fiƷtynge men, 
bolde and hardy, 
and somme fereful and cowardes. 
But as it longeþ 
to manere of craft 
and as a craft makeþ 
a man able oþer 
vnable to dedes of armes, 
we seide þat som craftes ben profitable to dedes of armes 
and somme vnprofitable. Chapter III We seide tofore 
þat þe philosofer wol mene, viii Poleticorum, 
þat fro fourtene Ʒere children 
scholde vse traueile of chiualrie and of armes. 
And þis accordeþ wiþ Vigesius, 
De Re Militari, 
and seith fro þe tyme of springynge of heer 
in þe schaar children 
scholde vse traueylle of cheualrie. 
And for we louen wel doynge 
þat we bygynnen in souþe, 
Ʒif þe makere of lawe wol make citeseyns fiƷtynge men 
and able to fiƷte, 
þei scholde raþer bygynne tofore tyme þanne late tyme passe and bygynne to late. 
For as Vigesius seith, 
bettere it is þat a | child 
be vsed tofore age of fiƷtynge 
þan þat he be sory 
that tyme and age is passed. 
Also it is a special resoun 
whi it nedeþ þat children 
in Ʒowþe vse craft of bataile, 
for it is not litel noþer liƷt craft 
to haue wisdome 
to dedes of armes. 
For Ʒif an hors man 
oþer a foot man mot fiƷte, 
it semeþ as it were happe 
to haue þe victorie 
Ʒif he haþ not þe craft of fiƷtynge; 
for boþe in fiƷtynge on hors and afote nedeþ manye cautels. 
For it is folie to leme not toforehoond 
but leme fiƷte whanne he mot nedes fiƷte whanne his lif 
is in peril of deeþ. 
Þanne for fiƷtynge men scholde haue tyme to lerne al þat nedeþ to bataille, 
þei scholde be vsed 
to dedes of bataille 
fro tyme of springyng heere 
in þe schaar. 
Wherfore Ʒif þe makers of lawe, 
kyng oþer prince schal do a bataille, 
he schal take with hym fiƷtynge men 
þat ben ivsed 
and ben stronge and orpede. 
For it is iknowe 
in what age fiƷtynge men scholde be take to dedes of armes, 
it is to tretynge 
by what signes 
scholde be knowe able men to fiƷte. 
Þanne it is to wytynge 
þat bolde men 
and hardye ben bettre to bataille 
þan ferful men. 
Also stronge men and men wiþ harde body, 
for þei ben more myƷty, 
scholde be chose to bataille. 
Also for we seen 
þat som bestes ben bolde to fiƷte 
and sum ben ferful, 
men þat ben most ileche to beestes 
þat ben bolde to fiƷte ben beste to bataille. 
By þre manere signes we knowen bolde men to fiƷte. 
First, 
by signes of boldenesse and hardenesse. 
Þe seconde, 
by signes of | myƷt and strengþe of body. 
Þe þridde, 
by signes of liknesse to beestes 
þat ben bolde to fiƷte. 
Þe signes of boldenes 
and of strengþe of fbodyf: liƷt eiƷe, arerynge of þe polle. 
Þerfore Vigesius seith 
þat a Ʒongelyng 
þat scholde be take 
to dedes of armes 
scholde haue a liƷt eyƷe 
and bere vp þe heed. 
And signes of strengþe of body 
and of lymes ben hard flesch, 
sadde senewes and brawn. 
For as þe philosofer seith, 
viii Poleticomm, 
þat dede of armes 
and scharpnes of wit 
nedeþ contrarie manere. 
For as it is iwrete, 
ii De Anima, 
men wiþ nesche flesche ben witty; 
but þe contrarie men 
with hard flesch 
and sad senewes and brawon ben myƷty and strong of body 
and most able to fiƷte. 
And signes of liknes to beestes 
þat ben bolde to fiƷte 
ben greete 
otmeste lemes and brood breeste. 
For we seen þat lyons 
þat ben strengeste of bestes 
hauen greet armes and brood brestes. 
Þanne whanne we seen 
þat a man haþ liƷt eyƷe and bereþ 
vp þe heed and haþ hard flesch 
with sad senewes and brawon 
with grete armes and brood breeste, 
we schal argue 
þat he is a worryour 
and able to fiƷte. 
Þanne suche men scholde be worriours, 
for comynliche þei ben able to dedes of bataille. Chapter IV 
As it longeþ to þis doynge, 
we may rekene eiƷte 
þat werryours scholde haue, 
by þe whiche 
as it longeþ 
to þis doynge 
we may declare what manere werriours 
a kyng oþer a prince scholde chese. 
For first, 
fiƷtynge men mote haue myƷt to bere and susteyne heuy burþones. 
Þe seconde, 
myƷt as it were alwey | 
to suffre meuynge of membres and greet traueille. 
Þe þridde, 
myƷt to suffre scarsete of mete and of drynke. 
Þe ferþe, 
þei scholde not recche of ese of liggyng and of stondynge. 
Þe fifþe, 
þe[i] scholde telle more prise of riƷtwisnesse 
and of þe comyn profit 
þan of bodilich lif. 
Þe sixte, 
not be agrised of schedyng of blood. 
Þe seuenthe, 
be sleyƷ and connynge 
to defende hemself 
and to smyte oþere. 
Þe eiƷteþe, 
to be aschamed 
to flee cowardliche. First, 
it is nedful to fiƷtynge men in bataille 
to haue myƷt 
to bere gret wiƷt, 
for nakede men fallen 
where euere þei [ben] smyte. Wherfore but a man mowe bere þe wiƷt of armere, 
he is vnprofitable to bataille. 
Þe seconde, 
it is spedful to worriours 
to suffre 
as it were contynuel traueille and meuynge of lymes. 
For Ʒif þei meue not alwey in bataille, 
his aduersaries ben not bygyled in smytynge for alwey 
he is isette to fonge strokes. 
For it is experience and assay 
þat a man 
þat moueþ alwey 
may vnneþe oþer neuere be smyte with ful strooke 
but alwey he voideþ woundes and strokes. 
For as Ʒif a signe meuede 
and abood not stille 
he ne scholde not be sone ismete of an archere, 
so a man þat meueþ alwey is not so sone iwonded of his enemye 
as a scholde Ʒif he stood stille and meuede not. 
Þanne continual meuyng of lymes 
is nedful for to voide wondes and strokes 
and also for to Ʒeue wondes and strokes, 
and þerfore fiƷtyng men most haue myƷt 
to dure long 
in continual meuyng of lymes. 
Þe þridde, 
fiƷtynge men scholde not recche of scarsete of mete | 
and of drynke. 
For passynge myƷt of armure, 
and to charge of oþere thinges 
þat nedeþ 
to defence of an ooste, defaute of mete and of drynke is most greuous; 
and Ʒut it is spedful to fiƷtynge men 
som tyme to spare mete and drynke. 
For þeiƷ fiƷtynge men haue mete and drynke 
ynowg withoute greef, 
3Ut abstinence is nedful for hem so 
þat he take not to moche mete and drynke 
for þanne 
þei mowe 
þe bettere dure traueile of fiƷtynge. 
#x00DE;e ferþe, 
þei scholde not recche of dissease of liggyng and of stondyng. 
For som tyme it is spedful to fiƷtyng men 
to be armed day and nyƷt, 
þerfore þei ben in noon ese noþer restyng liggyng noþer stondyng. Þe fifte, 
þei scholde telle more pris of riƷtwisnesse 
and of comyne profit þanne of bodilich lif. 
Þanne for alle þe dedes of bataille 
ben in peril of deþ, 
neuere man is fortys 
and bold werryour 
but he be in som wise dredles of peril of deþ. 
And as þe philosofer meneþ, iii Ethicorum, 
it longeþ to hym 
þat is fortis 
and a good werryour 
to drede not to die wel in bataille. 
And it is iseid 
þat a man deyeþ wel in bataille 
whanne þei fiƷten riƷtfullich, 
and for þe contre [he setteþ] 
hymsilf riƷtfulliche 
and bodiliche to perel of deeþ 
for som greet profit of þe comynte. 
And Ʒif a man loueþ bodilich lyf more þan þei scholde, 
he wol liƷtliche chese a foul fliƷt. 
Þe sixte, 
fiƷtynge men scholde not be agrise of schedynge of blood. 
For Ʒif a man haþ a nesche herte 
and is wommanliche 
and agdsed of 20 schedyng of blood, 
he dar not wounde his enemyes. 
And by þe consequent folwynge 
he dar not wel fiƷte in | ‡ bataille. 
Þe seuenþe, 
þei scholde be cunnynge 
to defende hemself 
and to smyte oþere. 
For as it is iseide, primo Ethicorum, þe ende of cheualrie is victorie. 
Butfor alle vertues 
and dedes ofbataille 
ben conteynedvnder chiualrie 
as it is declared tofore, 
and as þe philosofer seith it is iseide 
þat [of] alle dedes of bataille 
victorie is þe ende, 
wherfore by cause 
þat principalliche fiƷtynge men 
hauen þe victorie Ʒif 
þei kunne wel defende hemself 
and smyte oþere, 
connynge ofdefence 
and smytynge isspedful 
to fiƷtynge men in bataille. 
And how suche connynge may be had 
and how enemyes schol be smyte 
and what helpeþ heereto, 
it schal be declared herafter. 
Þe eiƷtþe, werriours scholde be schamed 
to flee cowardliche. 
For as it is seid, iii Ethicorum, 
most orpede werriours 
ben among men 
þat worschepeth orpede werriours. 
And among oþere þat maken a man able to fiƷte in bataille 
is loue to haue worschep of fiƷtyng 
and be aschamed to fle cowardliche. 
And it is to takyng heede 
þat for we seide 
þat werriours 
scholde not be agrise 
of chedynge of blood 
noþer telle greet prys of bodilich lif 
and oþere suche 
þat we rekened playnliche þe menyng: 
þat is [to] vnderstondynge in riƷtful bataille. 
For by cause of þe defence 
of þe contreye, of riƷtwisnesse, 
and of þe comyn profit, schedyng of blood scholde not be spared noþer oþer suche by þe whiche riƷtwisnesse 
and þe comyn profit may be defended. 
Herby it is playnliche iknowe what maner werryours 
and what fiƷtynge men a kyng oþer a prince scholde chese; 
for þei scholde be chose among | citeseyns 
þat hauen most of thinges 
þat nedeþ to fiƷtynge. Chapter V 
For thinges ‡ ben irekened 
þat werriours scholde haue, 
it is to 5 tretynge whiche ben best – por━t┐ men, gentil men and noble men, 
oþer vppelondische men. 
And Ʒif þynges þat ben iseid ben iknowe, 
it semeþ þat vppelondische men ben best. 
And it semeþ þat Vigesius 
is of þis opynyoun, 
for he seith in þis wise: 
“I neuere trowe 
þat þer myƷte be a doute imeued but þat vppelondische men 
ben most able to dedes of 
armes.” And herto helpeþ thinges 
þat we seide tofore. 
For it is iseide 
þat fiƷtynge men schulde susteyne greete and heuye wiötes, 
and continual trauele of lymes, 
scarsete of mete and of drynke, 
desese of liggynge and of stondyng, 
noþer drede deþ, 
noþer agrise of schedyng of blood, 
and oþere suche þat we speke of in þe nexte chapitre. 
And soþ it is þat vppelondische men most happen 
to þe forseide thinges, 
for vppelondische men ben ivsed to heuy burþons. 
Þerfore heuy armure schal not greeue hem 
þat ben ivsed 
in tyme of pees 
to more heuy burþouns. 
Also rennyng and meuynge of armes 
and of oþere lemes ‡ greueþ hem not, 
for þei ben continualliche ivsed 
to suche meuynge 
and grettere traueille. 
Also scarsete of mete 
and of drynke greueþ hem not, 
for þei holden hem apaied to drynke water 
and to eete greet breed. 
Also vppelondische men 
ben not igreued with desese of leggyng and stondyng, 
for þei dreden not hete 
of þe sonne noþer recchen of schadewe noþer knowen solace of baþes; 
but liggyng on þe sadde grounde he slepeþ 
more sweteliche þan gentil | 
men þat resten in beddes. 
Also it is semelich 
þat þei drede not moche deþ; 
for þe more delicatliche a man lyueþ 
and þe more solace he haþ in his lif, 
þe more he dredeþ deþ. 
And so it semeþ 
þat þei ben not agrise, 
þat is agast, 
of schedyng ofblood. 
For amongmen it semeþ 
þat vppelondische men ben most cruel, 
þanne to hem þat takeþ heede þerto it semeþ 
þat vppelondesche men 
ben best werryours. 
And oþere þer ben be þe whiche it semeþ 
ipreued þat port men, gentil men, 
and noble men ben best fiƷters. 
For among oþere þat maken men goode fiƷters is desire 
to haue worschip of fiƷtynge 
and be aschamed 
to flee cowardliche. 
And as þe philosofer seith, 
iii Ethicorum, 
þat made Ector boold and hardy, 
for Ector seide, 
“Ʒif eche flee out of þe bataille, 
þanne Polidamas wol reproue 
me.” Also in þis wise Diomedus 
was imaad bold and hardy; 
for he seide, 
“Ʒif I tume þe bac in bataille, þanne Ector wol do despice me 
among þe Troians 
and wol saye to me, 
‘Diomedes is 
ouercome.’” Wherfore 
by cause þat loue of worschep and schame of foule doynge longeþ more to gentil men 
þan to cherles, 
gentil men semeþ 
þe betere fiƷtynge men 
for hem schameþ to flee. 
Also scleythe and wisdom 
helpeþ moche in bataille, 
for som tyme sleygþe and wyles helpen more 
to gete þe victorie 
þan doþ strengþe of men. 
Þan for comynliche gentil men 
ben wisere and more sleyƷ þan cherles, 
it folweþ þat þei ben þe bettre fiƷtynge men. 
And thes tweyne semen most helplich 
to gete þe victorie: 
schame of fliƷt | 
and konnyng of fiƷtynge. 
Þanne for to knowe þe sooþ of þe doom 
þat is iaxed, 
it nedeþ to knowe þat for diuerse manere fiƷtynge diuerse fiƷttyng men scholde be chose. 
For fiƷttynge may be an hors oþer an foot; 
and in fiƷtynge afoot cherles ben bettre þan noble men, 
for vse of beryng of heuy wiƷtes helpelþ] 
most to dure in strong traueile. 
And in fiƷtynge an hors, 
gentil men and noble men ben best, 
for strengþe of hors helpeþ 
in defaute þat gentil men hauen. 
Strengþe of hors helpeþ 
for of hemself 
þei mowe not wiþ 
so greet traueille as cherles mowe. 
But in suche fiƷtynge cunnynge 
of fiƷtynge helpeþ 
moche wiþ schame of fliƷt. 
Nathalees it is to wetynge 
þat for to make gentil men 
and noble orpede fiƷters 
in eiþer manere fiƷtynge, 
þey scholde be vsed 
to ━b┐ere heuy armure 
and to suffre trauele and meuynge of membris of þe body, 
of armes and oþere membris 
as it nedeþ for dedes of armes. Chapter VI 
In libro De Re Mylitari, 
Vigesius seith þat vse of armure and cunnyng of fiƷtyng maad 
þe world sogette to þe Romayns; 
for what myƷte fewe Romayns 
do aƷenst manye Spaynels, 
aƷenste wyles of Assiries, 
and aƷenst þe wisdom of þe Grees 
but þei hadde be vsed in armes 
and hadde greet cunnynge of fiƷtynge? 25 
And it is not inconuenyent to a man 
þat is wis in o doynge 
be [vn]connynge 
in anoþer manere doynge 
for defaute of experience of particular doynge. 
And so ofte it falleþ þat wise men 
in oþere doynges 
for defaute of vse of armere ben not | cunnynge in bataille. 
For in eche manere doynge vse 
is cause of hardynesse so þat he þat is ivsed dredeþ 
not to do suche dedes. 
For as Vigesius seyth no man dredeþ 
to do dedes 
þat he troweþ 
þat he haþ wel ilemed. 
Þerfore it is þat in eche bataille 
vse of [‡ armes] 
is so moche worth 
þat fewe men 
þat ben ivsed ben redy to 35 
haue þe victorie, 
and manye þat ben vnkunnynge and boystors 
‡ ben alwey isette to fliƷt and to strokes. 
For it is iknowe þat vse of armes 
is ful profitable 
to do dedes of bataille, 
it is to declarynge how fiƷtynge men scholde be ivsed to go by ordre and passe. 
For suche doynges is nedful in bataille 
as it schal be declared, 
and defaute of vse 
of suche doynge 
is ful greuous to fiƷtynge men. 
And first, knyƷtes and foot men 
and alle fiƷtynge men 
scholde be vsed to goo 
in gree and paas of bataile so 
þat eche goo 
in his owne gree and ordre. 
For Ʒif þe schiltrom of foot men 
oþer of knyƷtes gon not in ordre, 
twey harmes comeþ þerof. 
For Ʒif þei gon not in þew ordre, 
þe schiltromschal be in oon side to þynne, 
as it were desparpuled 
and men to feer atwynne; 
and in þe oþer side 
to strayte 
with more prees þan nedeþ. 
And first, 
for þe oo side is to þynne 
and men ben to feer atwynne, 
enemyes comen þe sonnere withinne þe schiltrom; 
and so þe schiltrome 
is þe sonnere ouercome. 
Þe seconde, 
in þe side þat is to straiƷt wiþ 
to greet prees, 
men ben ilett for to smyte. 
For whan a fiƷtyng man ‡ 
is in to straiƷt prees 
of his felowes, 
his | armes ben ilette 
þat he may not smyte þe enemyes. For þes tweyne ben nedful in a schiltrom 
– þat enemyes come not sone wiþinne 
and þat he be not ilette to smyte – 
and þat may not be 
but þew gree and ordre be ikepte in goynge, 
þanne boþe foot men and hors men 
þat ar in vse of bataille 
scholde ofte come togeders 
and be vsed 
and iarmed and goo in ordre 
as þei þei scholde fiƷte in bataille. 
And Ʒif þe mayster of bataille 
seeþ eny fiƷtyng men 
out of ordre 
in þe schiltrom, 
[he] scholde blame hym 
and amende hym. 
Oþer Ʒif þei trespassen to moche, 
þei schul putte hym al out of þe schiltrom as oon 
þat is vnprofitable to fiƷte. 
Þe seconde, 
boþe foot men and hoors men scholde vse to renne 
for to be sweper and swift to renne 
tofore oþere, 
for it semeþ 
þat þat helpeþ to þre. First, 
to aspie doynge of enemyes, 
for it is good in an oost 
þat somme swyft men renne tofore 
þat mowe not sone be take of enemyes 
aspienge þe condiciouns and doyng of enemyes. 
Þe seconde, 
þat is good for to gete þe beste place; 
for place helpeþ moche in fiƷtynge. 
Þerfore Ʒif fiƷtynge men ben ivsed to renne among, 
‡ þei mow þe beter gete þ[e] beste place 
þat helpeþ to fiƷtynge. 
Also þat is good 
for to pursewe enemyes 
þat fleeþ, 
for a man may not sone scape here hondes 
þat rennen swiftliche. 
Þe þridde, 
fiƷtynge men scholde vse to lepe 
þat þei conne lepe oþer goo lepynge. 
And þat helpeþ to þre: firste, to putte of lettes; 
þe seconde, 
to fere enemyes; 
þe þridde, 
to smyte þe bettre strookes. 
And som tyme ben in þe wey | deches and oþere lettes 
þat mowe not be passed 
wiþoute lepyng. Wherfore it is good for to putte of lettes 
þat hors men conne so ride and prike hors 
þat þei mowe be lepynge passe deches and oþere lettes. 
Also foot men and knyƷtes Ʒif þei ben afoot, 
Ʒif þei wollen be good werriours, 
scholde in Ʒouþe vse to lepe 
þat þei mow be lepyng passe diches and oþere lettes. 
Also þerby enemyes ben aferd 
whanne þei seen here enemyes go to lepyng. 
Also lepyng by cause of meuyng maken smyte þe bettre strokes. Chapter VII 
And wiþoute þe forseide 
þre þat we seide þat werriours scholde vse, 
we may rekene eiƷte 
þat þei schulde vse. First, þei schul vse 
to bere hem burþons. 
Þe ii, 
to [rlese and to smyte with a maas. 
Þe þridde, 
to þrowe dartes 
and to smyte with speres. 
Þe ferþe, 
to schete arwes. 
Þe fifte, 
to þrowe stoones wiþ slynges. 
Þe sexte, 
to smyte with plumbatis. 
Þe seuenthe, 
to smyte hors. 
Þe eiƷte, 
to conne þe craft of swymmynge. 
Also eueremore it were to tellynge how werriou[r]s scholde vse 
to smyte wiþ swerdes, 
but herof we schal make a special chapitre. 
And first, werriours scholde vse to bere burþons so þat þei scholde vse more heuye wiƷtes þan þe wiƷt of þe armere 
in þe whiche þei scholde be armed. 
For vsage is as it were a certeyne kynde. 
Þanne whanne a man 
is ivsed to beere a greet wiƷt, 
it semeþ hym þat he is as it were liƷt 
whanne he goþ icharged wiþ lasse wiƷt. 
Also not onliche armure 
but also oþere | thinges mote be boore in bataille. 
Also þerfore it is good vse to bere more wiƷt 
þan þe armere weyeƷ. 
Þe seconde, 
worriours scholde vse to rese 
and to smyte with a maas. 
For Vigesius seith þat in olde tyme among þe Romayns 
in a certeyn feeld 
were manye poles ipiƷt, 
and children þat scholde be good men 
of armes scholde vse to rese to þulke poles 
so þat eche childes schilde schulde be suche to so heuy as þe schild 
þat is ibore in bataile 
and also a maas of tree of double wyƷt; 
and eche of thilke children 
so icharged scholde goo aƷenste oon of þulke poles 
as it were to aƷenste a enemye and smyte þat pole now aboue and now byneþe 
and now in þe myddel, 
and byhymself aƷensteþat polewith hastyreses smytyngeand defendynge hymself and doyng 
as it nedeþ in bataile aƷenst enemyes. 
And whanne þe children were longe ivsed for to do so 
eerliche and late and afterward, 
whan þey come to bataille 
þei were not igreued wiþ smytyng 
with maas noþer 
in durynge 
alle manere trauele of bataille. 
Þe þridde, 
also werriou[r]s scholde vse to þrowe dartes and gauelockes 
and to smyte 
with speres þe poles 
þat ben ipiƷt. 
And som tyme it was so 
þat whanne children were ivsed to smyte 
suche pooles ipiƷt wiþ 
a maas þanne he scholde vse to smyte wiþ darte and wiþ speere. 
For þei stood after and vsede here armes to þrowe 
þat þey myƷte smyte þe pole 
oþer þrowe nyƷ þerto. 
And it is to wetynge 
þat in þrowynge a dart oþer a speere first 
it mot be stron[g]liche | ischake 
and þerafter myƷtiliche ithrowe. 
For whanne þe dard 
is strongliche ischake, 
for þe grete meuynge 
þat it makeþ in þe eyƷere, 
it passeþ þe forþere 
and Ʒeueþ þe gretter strook. 
Þe ferþe, 
worryours scholde vse to schete arwes and quarels 
with bowes oþer with arblasters. 
For it happeþ som tyme þat we may not come to þe enemyes 
to fiƷte wiþ hem at honde. 
And þouƷ þei þat assayllen enemyes 
mow come to hem honde at honde, 
Ʒit ar þey come togeders, 
it is good to fere hem 
wiþ bowes and with arblasters. 
And it is iwrete of oon Affric[an]o Scipio 
þat whanne he scholde fiƷte for þe Romayns, 
he trowede not to haue þe victorie 
but he medled in al þe schiltroms chosene archers. 
Þe fifþe, 
worriours scholde vse 
to þrowe stones 
wiþ schlynges. 
And þis manere of fiƷtyng was ifounde 
in certeyne ilondes 
of þe see 
in þe whiche eylondes, 
as Vigesius seith, 
children were so scleyg 
þat here moders wolde Ʒeue hem no mete 
but suche as þei smete wiþ here slynges. 
And þis vsage is good for it 
is no traueyle to bere a slynge. 
But som tyme it happeþ 
þat fiƷtynge is in stony place 
and þat som hulle mot be defended. 
Also in asaylynge of castels and citees 
it is good 
to þrowe stones with slenges. 
Þe sexte, 
werriours scholde vse 
to smyte wiþ plumbattes. 
For a bal of leed oþer of ire ichayned 
to a stale oþer 
a staffe of tree Ʒeueþ 
a soore strooke. For by cause of strong meuyng of þe eiƷere, 
such a bal ichayned to a staffe Ʒeueþ 
a more soor strook 
þan it scholde Ʒif it were iiuned faste to þe staffe. 
And | worriours scholde vse al manere smytynges 
for to fiƷte 
and smyte diuerseliche aƷenste diuerse enemyes. 
Þe seuenþe, 
werriours scholde vse to lepe to horse. 
For as Vigesius seith 
in olde tyme 
þer were hors imaad of tree 
on þe whiche children scholde vse to lepe in wynter in house 
and in somer in felde. 
First þei scholde lepe on suche horse 
vnarmed and afterward iarmed; and vsede so to lepe in eyþere side 
in boþe riƷt side 
and lift side and al aboute, 
and vsede so to lepe 
þat þei wolde lepe to þulke horse 
with swerdes idrawe, 
and vsede so to lepe in pees 
þat þei wolde in werre lepe 
to hors anoon withoute abydyng. 
Þe eiƷte, worriours scholde vse þe crafte of swymmyng 
and cunne swymme. 
For brygges beþ not alwey redy 
and depnesse of water is vnknowe. 
Wherfore for vnkonnyng of swymmynge 
many men ben ilost. 
Þerfore amongþe Romayneswas anvsage 
þat children 
þat scholde be worriours 
after þat þei hadde ivsed dedes of armes 
a greet deel of þe day, 
Ʒif it were couenable tyme 
for to swymme, 
þey scholde be ilad to þe fleem 
þat hatte Tyber 
for to leme craft of swymmynge. 
And not oonliche foot men 
but also hors men made hors vse to swymme. 
But it is to wetynge 
of þat forseyde vse of doynge 
som ben most proper to hors men 
and somme to foot men 
and somme to boþe. 
And how it stondeþ 
þerof it nedeþ 
not to make grete tretys, 
and it may not be vnknowe 
to wise men and witty. 
For lepyng to hors is propre 
to hors men and þrowynge stoones | 
wiþ sclenges is proper 
to fot men 
and oþer doynges longeþ 
in som wyse to boþe. Chapter VIII Amonge oþere, 
dedes of bataile semeþ most perelous. 
Þerfore þerinne nedeþ greet besynesse, 
for in suche dedes 
may no man be [to] 
waar noþer ━haue┐ ━to┐ manye cautels. 
For in fiƷtynge it is bettere 
to haue more besynesse 
þan suche batailles axe þanne it is to be 
necgligent in eny wise. 
For Vigesius seith þat Catoun seide 
þat in oþere 
dedes errour may be amended. 
But errour of bataille may not be amended, 
but þe peyne folweþ þe errour anon. 
For þei þat fiƷten vnwisliche and vnredyliche 
ben ilost anoon 
oþer þei turnen 
and ben imaad so ferful 
þat vnneþe oþer neuere þei dar fiƷte aƷenste þe victories. 
Wherfore it is not to passynge 
þat it is good in bataille 
to haue manye cautels; 
al þat is good and profitable 
to þe oost it were good iknowe 
lest he be ouercome of enemyes. 
Hit happeþ ofte tyme by daye 
and by nyƷte 
þat þe oost 
is wiþoute diches 
and is not waar þat enemyes ben nyƷ, 
and enemyes comen vppon þe oost vnwar and ouercome þe oost. 
Þerfore after þat þe oost 
haþ 
ydo his ioumeye 
and wol som whare abyde al nyƷt oþer lengere tyme, 
Ʒif enemyes mow by happe come to þat place, 
anoun scholde diches be maad 
aboute þe ‡ oost 
and som strengþe arered 
as it were castels. 
For no þyng is so good noþer so nedful in bataile 
as it is 
þat strengþes be wel imaad and castels be set ariƷt, 
so þat withinne þe space of þe castels 
al þe oost may abyde sikerliche and saafliche in | what side it euere be 
þat enemyes comen and bysegen hem. 
And an oost schal haue alwey wiþ hym good strengþes 
so þat it may seme 
whanne þei pecchen here 
[i]n ‡tentes 
þat þei leden aboute wiþ hem 
as it were strong walled citee. 
For it is iknowe 
þat it is good 
to make diches and castels aboute an oost, 
it is to declarynge 
in what wise suche strengþe and castels scholde be maad. 
For Ʒif þe enemyes ben absent, 
it is not greet maystrie 
to dike and make diches 
and arere strengþe and castels aboute þe oost. But Ʒif þe enemyes ben present, 
þanne it is hard to make strengþe and castels. 
And in suche a caas tweyne ben nedful – 
oon 
is wiþstondynge of enemyes, 
and þe oþer makyng of castels. 
And in suche caas be menynge of wis men, 
þe oost schold be departed so 
þat al hors men [and] oon partie of þe foot men 
scholde be ordeyned 
in þe schiltrom 
to putte of þe rees of enemyes; 
and þe oþer partie of foot men 
þat may swyfliche and sone make castels 
scholde werche swyftliche and make castels. 
And in makynge of castels and diches mote be certeyne maysters ouere oþere 
to make þe slowe spede 
and to telle eche how 
and what he scholde doo. 
For it is declared þat it is good to make castels 
and how castels scholde be maad 
in presence of enemyes, 
it is to declarynge 
what moot be knowe 
in makynge of castels. 
And in makyng of dyches 
and of castels 
wiþinne þe whiche þe oost schal abyde 
þre mot be knowe – place, schappe, 
and þe manere of þe strengþe. 
And as it longeþ to þis doynge, 
touchynge þe place foure mot be knowe. First, | 
þat þer be water inow and oþere thinges 
þat nedeþ to þe oost. 
Þe seconde, 
þer scholde no hille be 
þer nyg noþer oþer place out of þe whiche þe oost myƷt be assailled. 
Þe þridde, 
touchinge þe place it is to takynge heede of þe space 
aboute þe whiche þe strengþe schal be arered 
so þat no more space be take 
þan nedeþ for so manye men. 
Also þat not so litel be take 
þat it be to straiƷt 
and to litel for þe oost. 
Þe ferþe, 
Ʒif it nedeþ 
þat þe oost abide þer longe tyme, 
Ʒif it may be, 
a place scholde be chose 
þat stondeþ in good ayre. 
For in an oost nedeþ 
not onliche be waar of wondes, 
but also Ʒif it may be it 
nedeþ 
to be waar of pestilence, eueles. 
For it is iknowe wherof me scholde take hede touchinge places of castels, 
it is to declarynge 
of what schap þei scholde be. 
And it semeþ 
þat Vigesius wolde mene þat strengþes and diches 
aboute an oost scholde haue foure sides 
and be euene long. 
Nathales for round schap 
of a cercle fongeþ most, 
betere it is to make strengþe of round schap 
oþer of schappe with manye corners. 
For þer is greet drede of rees of enemyes it nedeþ to make diches for þe corners, 
for þat schap is most able to defence 
a[s] it schal be seid herafter. 
And suche a schap is best in makyng of castels 
[but] 
þer ben som ilette in þe place. 
For it happeþ som tyme in a place 
þat suche schap may not be þerinne. 
And in suche a caas castels 
scholde be maad of þe schap 
of half a cercle 
oþer þre cornerde 
oþer square 
oþer of som oþer schap as þe place axeþ. 
And þe principal 
[Ʒ]at scholde be mad 
tow|ard þe enemyes and þederward 
as þe oost passeþ. 
Also in castels scholde be sette vp baners and penouns and pencels 
þat Ʒif it happeþ 
þat eny of þe oost be fer 
fro þe castels 
þey mow be siƷt of baners 
and penouns come hoom aƷeyn. 
For þese þynges ben itreted, 
þe manere of makynge of strengþe 
and of castels is to knowynge. 
For Ʒif þe oost wol abyde þere longe tyme, 
þe more strong strengþe scholde be maad 
and þe more large diches. 
But Ʒif þei wol abide þere but oon nyƷt oþer elles 
but a litel tyme, 
þanne it nedeþ 
not to make so greet strengþe. 
And Vigesius techeþ 
þe manere of quantite of diches; 
and seith Ʒif þer is drede of greet strengþe of enemyes, 
þe diche schold be nyne foot brood 
and seuene foot depe. 
And Ʒif þer is grettere strengþe of enemyes, 
þe diche schold be þe more brood 
and þe more deep so 
þat he be twelf foot brood. 
But as it is to wetynge 
þat Ʒif þe diche is nyne foot brood, 
þe erþe þat is iþrowe vp on þe diches brynke riseþ foure foot heye so þat þe diche is 
as it were elleuene foot deep. 
And þe diche schal be outward 
toward þe enemyes 
and þe erþe schal be þrowe inward toward þe oost. 
And in þat erþe scholde be ipiƷt stakes and poles 
and oþere treen 
and oþere strengþe 
þat scholde be lad 
aboute wiþ þe oost. 
And whan castels 
and diches ben so imaad, 
þe oost may abyde þe more sikerliche. Chapter IX 
As it is declared, 
in dedes of bataille 
is most nede to be waar. 
For in happes of batail is no remedie, 
it is besiliche to takyng heede of alle thinges 
þat scholde be knowe in bataille 
and þat | tofore 
þat þe batailles fiƷte. 
For bettere it is not fiƷte 
þan þat a man putte hymself to fortune 
and to hap withoute good avisement. 
And in bataile we seen tweyne – fiƷtynge men 
and help þat nedeþ to fiƷte. 
And as it longeþ 
to þis doynge, 
touchynge fiƷtynge men sex mote be knowe; 
and touchyng þe helpe, 
oþere sexe may be rekened 
þat scholde also be þere iknowe. 
For a kyng oþer a prince 
oþer a duk of an oost þat scholde be sobre, 
wise and slyƷ nedeþ 
to knowe twelue in al, 
sex touchynge þe men 
and sexe touchynge oþere helpes 
ar he Ʒeue a bataille. 
And touchyng þe men 
þat schal fiƷte ben sexe 
þat helpeþ to haue þe victorie. 
Þe firste is þe nombre and tale of fiƷtynge men. 
For with oþere thinges irewled ariƷt, 
þe more nombre of men 
scholde haue þe victorie. 
For as it is iseid, 
ii Poleticorum, 
quantite in fiƷtynge is profitable 
as þe more wiƷt weyƷet more 
þan þe lasse. 
Þe seconde, 
touchinge þe fiƷtynge men here vsage of doynge scholde be knowe. 
For þei þat hauen armes not ivsed to smyte and lymes not ivsede to fiƷte [ben] failyng in susteynyng of fiƷtynge, 
for vsage is as it were anoþer kynde, 
so þat eche man 
þat is ivsed doþ his workes 
þe more strongliche and þe more spedfulliche and wiþ 
þe lasse peyne and trauayle. 
Þe þridde, 
suffrynge of disease 
of body scholde be knowe, 
for þei þat ben in an oost mote 
suffre manye deseses. 
Wherfore Ʒif þer ben eny men 
þat ben nesche and wommanliche 
þat may not with desese 
þat werryours suffren and men þat ben ouercome 
for þulke deseses, 
þei | forsaken to fiƷte 
and fleeþ out of þe oost. 
Þe ferþe, strengþe scholde be iknowe and hardnesse of body. 
For þer is greet difference betwene hardnesse of yren and neschenesse of selkene clooþ and likynge of pleye 
and scharpnesse of fiƷtynge. 
For to speke of bataylle generalliche al men wol be good werriours; 
but whanne þei comen to assay of particuler dedes and tasteþ 
þe hardynesse of yre and myƷt of armure 
and how gret þe trauaille is of fiƷtyng 
and how sore þe wondes 
ben þat enemyes Ʒeuen, comynlich he is hard of flesch 
and strong of body Ʒif he draweþ hym not for suche thinges 
out of þe bataile. 
For Ʒif it happe þat men 
with nesche flesch desiren fiƷtynge and bataile 
after þei hauen assayed fiƷtynge in batayl, 
þat is bot selde. 
For as it is iseide tofore, 
men with nesche flesche 
ben witty and comynliche vnhable to fiƷte, 
for it is hard to suche men to susteyne þe wiƷt of armere 
and here woundes 
ben more sore 
and smyrteþ þe worse. 
Þe fifte, 
in worriours wyles scholde be iknowe and scleygþe for to fiƷte. 
For þe more waar werryours ben, 
þe sonnere þeygeten þe victorie. 
Þe sexte, 
myƷt and boldynesse of herte scholde be knowe; 
for in fiƷtynge comynliche þei 
þat ben most hardy and bold of herte hauen þe victorie. 
Þanne kyng and prince 
oþer duk of an oost or þei fiƷte in bataille scholde take hede of sexe touchynge fiƷtynge men. 
Þe firste, 
in wheþer side be mo fiƷttynge men. 
Þe seconde, 
whiche ben most ivsed. 
Þe þridde, 
whiche ben most strong to suffre desese. 
| Þe ferþe, 
whiche ben f. i69v most strong and hard of bodye. 
Þe fifte, 
whiche ben more wis and witty. 
Þe sexte, 
which ben þe more strong, 
boolde and hardye. 
And þanne a sobre kyng, prince, 
oþer duke 
as he seeþ 
þat his oost is desposed 
and haþ inow of þes condicions 
oþer faillen 
þerof may hiƷe and spede to fiƷte 
oþer putte of þe bataille 
for a tyme oþer fiiƷte oponliche oþer preueyliche by buschementes. 
For sex condicions ben irekened 
þat scholde be knowe tofore a bataille 
of areste touchinge fiƷtynge men, 
oþer sexe beþ to rekenynge 
þat toucheþ thinges 
þat helpeþ in bataille. 
For in bataille helpen hors, armere, vitailles, place of fiƷtynge, tyme, 
and helpe of frendes and of soudiours. 
And first, þe duk of an oost scholde take heede 
in wheþer side 
ben þe mo hors and bettere. 
Þe seconde, 
in wheþer side 
ben þe bettre archers 
and mo men of armes with bettere armere. 
Þe þridde, 
in wheþer side 
is most plente of vittailes. 
For som tyme withoute wounde 
and withoute bataille enemyes 
ben dede faylyng vitailes 
and mowe not abyde for scarsete of vitailles. 
Þe ferþe, 
þe fiƷtynge ‡ place scholde be knowe 
as wheþer partie is in þe heiƷere place oþer in þe bettre place to ÜƷte. 
Þe fifte, 
tyme scholde be knowe wheþer in þe tyme þat bataille scholde be þe sonne be in þe face of þe oo partie oþer 
in þe face of þe enemyes, 
and Ʒif þe wynd bloweþ and rereþ poudre aƷenst hem 
oþer aƷenst þe enemyes. 
For þei þat hauen þe sonne 
and wynd and poudre aƷenst hem ben igreued in þe eyƷene 
and mowe not wel fiƷte. 
The sexte, 
it scholde be knowe wheþer partie abydeþ mo helpers. 
For | Ʒif enemyes abyden more helpe, 
oþer it is not to doynge to fiƷte, 
oþer fiƷtynge scholde be hiƷed and ihasted, 
and Ʒif þeyhemself abyden more help, 
þe fiƷtyng scholde be taryed. 
Þanne Ʒif þesþynges ben besiliche iseye, 
a wiseduke of anoost may knowe atte folle Ʒif 
it is to doynge to Ʒeue a bataille. 
For Ʒif þei seen 
þat he hymself haue inow of þe forseyde condicions 
oþer failleþ, 
so he may bere hymself touchynge þe bataille. 
But on caas neuere alle þe forseide condiciouns 
ben al ifere in þe oo syde; 
nathales where þe moo 
and þe betere condicions beþ ifere, 
þat partie is þe bettre partie to fiƷte, 
as it is playnliche iknowe to hym 
þat takeþ heede. Chapter X Alwey a vertue is strengere whanne it is iooned 
þan whanne it is departed and ischad. 
And som tyme it happeþ 
þat whanne a bataille 
is ido þe orders and schiltromes 
ben destrubled and ischad. 
And for þat scholde not falle, 
it was ivsed in olde tyme 
þat þe oost scholde be deled 
in rowtes and schiltroms. 
And eche hadde a baner so 
þat in eche baner by lettres oþer 
by oþere signes 
þat were iknowe it scholde be knowe 
of what rowte oþer of what schiltrom 
þat baner was; 
so þat Ʒif it happed 
þat eny fiƷtyng man went 
out of his owne schiltrom, 
he myƷte by suche a banere sone 
knowe his owne schiltrome 
and come aƷen þerto. 
Þanne it is good in batailles 
to haue baners, penouns, and pensels, and signes, 
þat þe oost be not isched noþer imedled oþere wise 
þan it scholde. 
Also it is spedful in bataille 
to haue dukes and leders, centeners and vynteners, 
and oþere ouereseers of bataile. 
| For þe hoole oost 
is ilikned to o body; 
wherfore as al þe membres of oon body he[l]peth eche oþer, 
so alle þe fiƷtynge men 
and alle þe partees 
of þe same oost 
scholde defende and helpe eche oþer. 
Wherfore as þe workes of membres 
ben ischend and iconfunded 
but þei ben irewled 
by þe heed 
in þe whiche is witte and knowyng, 
so fiƷtynge men in an oost ben confunded 
but þei hauen a certeyne ledere 
þat scholde be heere heed and rewelere. 
Þerfore in olde tyme for suche confusioun 
scholde not falle in bataille, 
on was iordeyned duke and ledere and maistere of alle þe oost. 
And vndere þat duk were oþere leders 
þat were icleped centuriones, 
and vnder hem were oþere þat were icleped decani. 
And decanus haþ þe name of decem, 
ten, 
as cenmrio haþ þe name of centum, an hundred. 
And centurio haþ vnder hym decanus 
so þat he is ouer 
an hundred fiƷtynge men 
and ouer ten decanus, 
and eche decanus 
vnder hym ten men. 
And in þe basnet of centurio were letters iwrete 
by þe whiche eche decanus 
knewe his owne centurio 
and wiste wham he scholde folwe. 
Also in þis basenet decanus 
was a certeyne signe 
iprented 
by þe whiche þe ten fiƷtynge men 
þat were vnder hym knewe here owne decanus. 
And in þis manere 
oþer wise in schiltroms, 
boþe of hors men and of foot men, 
scholde be iordeyned dukes and leders and banyours 
so þat eche myƷte wete what he scholde doo. 
And in bataille is so greet drede and affray 
for noyse of roschynge of armere 
and for smytynge 
þat wordes 
mowe not suffice 
to rewle þe fiƷtynge men; 
but þer nedeþ certeyne signes | 
so þat eche may knowe oonliche by sighte 
how þei scholde holde hym 
in þe schiltrom 
and what þei scholde do. 
And hereby it may be knowe what men scholde bere baners and penouns and oþere signes. 
For Ʒif baners and signes ben ibrook, 
al þe puple is ischent. 
Þanne with greet besynesse 
þe baniour scholde be chose so þat he scholde be strong of body, 
stedefast of herte, 
trewe to þe prince, expert and kunnynge in armes, 
and haue oþere condicions 
þat nedeþ 
to an orpede and noble 
werriour.40 
And it fil in oure tyme þat al þe puple of a citee 
was ouercome by fewe werriours 
by fraude of þe baniour 
þat hidde þe banyre. 
Wherfore þe fiƷtynge men were ischent as men þat hadde non heed noþer wiste 
wherto þei scholde take heede. 
Wherfore Ʒif in bataille manye men ben in perelle of deþ, 
wiþ greet besynesse 
þe banoure scholde be chose. 
Also herby it may be iknowe what man scholde be ledere 
in an oost 
ouer hors men 
and also ouer foot men. 
For as þe heed 
is more worþ 
þan oþere lymes, 
so in a bataille 
þe most worthi werriour 
scholde be ouer þe rowtes 
þat nedeþ to fiƷtynge. 
Þanne for foot men 
scholde be good werriours, 
þei scholde be strong and myƷty 
and of good stature, 
and konnynge to þrowe schaftes and dartes; 
and also þei scholde kunne brandische and schake a swerd for to smyte, 
and turne his scheld 
aboute todefendehymself; 
and þei scholde haue a liƷteye, 
and be swift, and sobre, 
and kunnynge in armere. 
And al þes condiciounes nedeþ 
to be more parfitliche in hym 
þat is ouer fiƷtynge foot men. 
Þanne he þat is ouer fiƷtynge foot | 
in fiƷtynge scholde be strong and myƷty, 
greet of stature, 
connynge to þrowe schaftes and dartes, 
and to fiƷte and to smyte wiþ a swerd, 
and bytume aboute his schelde 
to defende hymself. 
And þei scholde haue liƷt eyƷe and be sobre, 
and haue al experience of armere 
þat þei kunne teche to fiƷtynge men 
þat ben vnder hem and make hem fiƷte wel and scowre here armere. 
For briƷtnesse and schenyng of armere 
fereþ enemyes so 
þat he þat bereþ suche armere 
is iholde a good werriour. 
And rousty armere 
is tokene of vnkonnynge of hym 
þat bereþ suche armere. 
Þanne Ʒif he þat scholde be ouer fot men 
in fiƷtynge scholde be expert and konnynge in armere 
and be suche on 
as we hauen discreued, 
moche more he scholde be konnynge in armere and moche of body 
and strong and myƷti 
þat scholde be ouer an oost 
in bataile of hors men. 
For in suche a bataille 
is more strong fiƷtynge þanne in fiƷtynge of foot men. 
Þanne þe souerayne and ledere of bataille 
of knyƷtes mote be swift of body 
þat he may lepe swiftliche 
to hors iarmed, 
and cunne ride swyftliche, 
smyte wiþ a spere, 
and þrowe dartes, 
and defende hymself 
with his scheld, 
and fiƷt with maas 
and wiþ swerd, 
and haue al connynge of armere 
þat he may teche his knyƷtes 
to fiƷte strongliche, 
and make hem scoure here armere, 
and do oþere dedes 
þat nedeþ to bataylle. Chapter XI 
Of alle dredful thyng, 
deþ is most dredful and ende of al dredful ‡ thinges, 
a[s] it is iseid, iii Ethicorum. 
Þanne where enemyes ben | aboute to slee men 
and liggen in awayte 
for to slee citeseyns nedeþ 
al maner cautel so 
þat þe oost be kept hool and sond and lif of citeseyns isaued. 
Þanne it is not inow to knowe thinges 
þat scholde be iknowe in fiƷtynge in bataille 
but me knowe also cautels 
to putte of lettes of weyes and to be waar of boschementes, 
þat þe oost falle not in peril 
by boschementes of enemyes isette in þe wey oþer 
by sides þe wey. 
And as it longeþ 
to þis doynge we may rekene eigte cautelsþat þe duk ofa bataille 
scholde haue in mynde for to saue þe wey of fiƷtynge men 
þat ben vnder hym. Firste, 
þei scholde haue iwrete þe weyes of contrees 
by þe whiche þe oost schal passe, 
and þe space betweyne place, 
and þe manere of weyes and paþes and tumynges and wyndynges, 
and þe monteyns and reuers 
þat ben in þe wey. 
And Ʒif he myƷte, [þ]e [duk of þe oost] 
scholde haue þe paas (mounteyns) and reuers (tornynges and wendynges) discreued and ipeynt in parchement oþer in a clooþ, 
þat he myƷte as it were isee wiþ his eyƷe 
how þe oste scholde passe 
and how he myƷte beste lede his oost saafliche. 
For so doþ schip men þat seiƷ þe periles of þe see. 
For to saue here schippes 
fro schip breche þe[i] hauen a clooþ 
þat hatte mappa maris, 
þe clooþ of þe see 
and lettes and periles 
þerof and oþere suche thinges. 
And schip men loken þeron and knowen anon how þei scholde wende 
and in what place þei ben and where of þei mote be waar. 
Þanne for boschementƷ of enemyes 
an oost is in as manye perils 
oþer in mo perils in þe wey 
þan schip men in þe see, 
in no wise an oost scholde passe 
by a wey in þe | 
whiche may be perel 
but þe duke of þe oost haue discreued 
and ipeynt þe manere of weyes, mounteyns, and reueres, 
and oþere thinges 
þat ben in þe wey. 
Þe seconde cautel is 
þat þerwiþ 
þat he haþ weyes and manere weyes discreued and ipeynt, 
[þ]e duk of bataylle scholde haue guydes 
þat knowen wel þe weyes and hauen ofte ipassed þerby. 
For siƷt of thinges 
þat ben discreued and ipeynt maken not thinges 
so wel iknowe as þei ben iknowe by hemself 
Ʒif we seen hem in dede, 
for þynges ben iknowe bettere by hemself 
Ʒif þei ben iseye in dede 
þanne by peynture and liknesse þerof. 
Neþþelees leste þe gydes caste fraude and gyle, 
þe duke schal sette aboute hym good kepynge and warde 
þat he mowe not scape and flee. 
Also he schal manase to slee hem Ʒif þei don eny gyle and byhoote hem good Ʒiftes Ʒif þei doun wel and treweliche. 
Þe þridde, 
þei scholde haue wiþ 
hem manye wis men and trewe to þe prince 
and ivsed to bataille, 
and do by here counsaille 
al þat is to doynge. 
For in so greet perel no man scholde triste 
to his owne witte noþer in hemself alone. 
Þe ferþe cautel is 
þat þe weyes scholde be vnknowe 
by þe whiche þe oost scholde passe. 
For þe more preueye þe dukes counsaile is, 
þe lasse þerof þe ordinaunce is ilette and comeþ þe bettre and þe sonere to good ende. 
And whanne it is iordeyned 
in what weyes þe oost scholde passe 
and þe duke haþ thulke weyes discreued 
and ipeynt and haþ goode gydes and trewe, 
þe more preueye þat is, 
and þe lasse iknowe to þe enemyes, 
þe | more sikereliche 
þe oost may passe. 
Þe fifte [i]s to haue in eche ward 
and in eche schiltrom trewe hors men and strong and orpede 
þat hauen swift hors and stronge 
þat scholde prike forþward and bakward, 
li[ft]som and riƷtsom, 
and in eche side a discouere[n] 
þe contrey and buschementes leste som enemy ligge in awayte to aspye 
in what side þei myƷte greue þe oost. 
For þei no men knewe þe dukes counsaile, 
Ʒut for þe oost begynneþ to passe by som weyes, 
som man may gesse 
by what weyes þei scholde passe. 
And for it is to trowynge 
þat alwey 
in suche doynge ben spies, 
þe duke of þe bataille scholde thenke þat it myƷt 
also be knowe to þe enemyes. 
Also for þe forseide perels scholde greue þe lasse, 
þe contrey and buschements scholde be discouered 
by most swift hors men leste þe oost myƷte be greued vnwaar in eny side. 
[Þe sixte, þat]‡ alwey in þat side 
in þe whiche is most drede of perel 
scholde be ordeyned best knyƷtes 
and best fiƷtyng foot men. 
And Ʒif drede is of perel in eche side, 
[in eche side] 
scholde remedie be ordeyned. 
Þe seuenþe, 
þat þe oost goo not out of ordre. 
For Ʒif þe schiltrom is disarayed, 
it is þe sonnere ouercome. 
And alwey an oost scholde goo 
in suche aray so 
þat Ʒif þe enemyes were present, 
þei myƷte not greue þe oost. 
Þerfore it is iseid in a prouerbe, 
Qui est munitus non est derisus: 
he þat is iwamed 
and istrengþed 
is not iscomed. 
Þanne alwey þe duke of bataille 
þat haþ þe charge of þe lif of so manye men 
scholde be besiliche iwaar þat enemyes falle | 
not as it were on oon 
þat is negligent and slepynge. 
Also þe duke of an oost, centuriones and decani, 
and oþere leders 
in dedes of bataille, 
scholde alwey menge and charge knyƷtes and foot men 
to be alwey redy to fiƷte so 
þat Ʒif þer happeþ eny rees, 
þat þei mowe sodeynliche withstonde hem 
þat reseþ. 
And Ʒif þei doun so, 
þei þer falle a sodeyn rees oþer asauƷt, 
þe ost is alwey 
as it were avised and enemyes scholde greue þe lasse. 
Þe eiƷte cautel 
is to take heede 
wheþer 
in þe ost be mo foot men 
oþer hors men, 
for hors men defendeþ hymself best 
in feldes and foot men 
in wodes and in mounteyns. 
And so as þe duk of þe batayle knoweþ 
þat he haþ manye hors men 
oþer foot men, 
he may chese large weyƷes 
by feldes 
oþer by wodes and monteyns 
and oþer 
as he knoweþ 
þat it is to doynge. Chapter XII After þat we hauen iseid 
where vnder doyng of bataille is conteyned, 
and in what contrees ben best werriours, 
and of what craftes ben best fiƷtynge men, 
and hauen also declared how in an oost scholde be maad strengþe and castels, 
and what thinges scholde be knowe Ʒif me scholde fiƷte in bataille of areste, 
and what cautels þe duk of batailles 
scholde haue to saue his oost 
wiþoute greef 
in weyes touchinge felde bataille, 
it semeþ þat it nedeþ telle no more 
butþat we teche to ordeyne schiltroms 
to smyte enemyes 
and to rese on hem. But first we schal telle 
of þe ordres of schiltroms; 
for Ʒif þe ordre of schiltroms 
is isaued in bataille, 
it helpeþ moche to fiƷtynge men. 
For as Vigesius | seith, 
but fiƷtynge men ben iordeyned in a þew space, 
þei mowe not wel fiƷte. 
For Ʒif þei ben to strayte iset, 
þei ben ilet 
þat þei mow not smyte þe enemyes. 
And Ʒif þei ben isette to þynne 
and to fer atwynne, 
þanne þe enemyes mow come withinne hem 
and breke þe scheltrom and ouercome hem. 
And withoute greet vse it may not be þat hors men and foot men hoolde hem wel in þe ordre in here schiltroms. 
Þanne he þat wol werre in eny tyme scholde longe tyme tofore vse his fiƷtynge men 
to holde þew ordre in schiltrom. 
And in þe manere 
by þe whiche fiƷtynge men 
scholde kepe hem in suche ordre 
it is so 
þat boþe hors men 
and foot men scholde ofte come in to þe feldes. 
And he þat is ivsed in bataille 
and scholde be mayster 
ouer hors men and foot men 
scholde firste sette hors men 
and foot men arewe, 
as it were by a lyne, 
so þat þei stonde arewe and iliche fer atwynne by þe space 
þat nedeþ for schiltrom of hors men 
oþer of foot men. 
Þerafter he schal ordeyne double schiltrom 
so þat half þe schiltrom 
be anon departed 
fro þe oþer half 
and be iordeyned arewe tofore oþer byhynde þe oþer half. 
And whanne þat is ido, 
anon þe duke schal hoot 
to make a quadrate schiltrom 
and þanne to make a triangle, 
þre comerd, 
and þat may be sone ido. 
For in a quadrible schiltrom 
Ʒif þe dyameter is forkytte 
and þe quadrate parties iioyned togeders, 
þanne þei maken a triangle. 
But for not alle men 
vnderstondeþ 
þis maner of geometrie, 
takeþ alle for oon menynge þat whanne þe fiƷtyng men ben ibrouƷt 
in to þe feeld, 
boþe | hors men and foot men, 
þe duke of þe bataille 
schal hoote to ordeyne 
a schiltrom ischape 
as a quadrangle and þerafter 
as a triangle and þanne round 
and so of oþere. 
And so þei scholde vse fiƷtynge men 
to konne make schiltrom 
of al manere schap. 
For þes þynges ben iknowe, 
it is to wetynge þat among schappes of schiltroms quadrangle schap is lest worþ. 
Þerfore of þis schap scholde neuere schiltrom be ischape withoute special cause, 
as Ʒif it happeþ 
þat þe place axeþ such a schap; 
and in suche a caas 
a schiltrom scholde be ischape. 
And profitable schappes [of] schiltroms for to fiƷte ben schap of a schild, al round, 
and þe schap of a schere oþer of an hors schoo. 
For fiƷtynge men wol oonliche defende hemself 
and suffre strokes 
oþer þei wolle assaille oþere. 
And Ʒif fiƷtynge men felen hemself 
not strong inow to assaille þe enemyes 
but þat it is inow 
for hem to defende hemself, 
þanne þe schiltrom schal be maad al round and fiƷtynge men schal be sette þikke so 
þat þe schiltrom 
may not be broke. 
And aboute þe scheltrom 
in þe ende þerof 
and in þe ottere side 
scholde be sette men 
wiþ heuy armere 
and ben iarmed 
þat may best fonge strokes withoute greef. 
And Ʒif þe fiƷtynge men feleþ hemself stronge inow to assaye þe enemyes, 
þanne by þe proporcioun of hem 
as þei ben moo oþer lees, 
þe schiltrom scholde be schape 
as a schere so 
þat þe schiltrom scholde be open 
as an hors schoo oþere 
as a scheere for to take 
and close inne þe enemyes. 
And Ʒif þe enemyes ben manye, 
þe schiltrom scholde be schape 
as a scheld | 
þat it may departe 
and dele þe enemyes. 
For whanne þe enemyes ben departed, 
þei ben þe sonnere ouercome. 
Þanne a round schiltrom 
is good 
and to susteyne and to defende; 
and schiltrom ischape 
as a scheere is good to close 
and byclippe enemyes 
whanne þei ben fewe; 
and a schiltrom ischape 
as a scheld is good to departe 
and to dele enemyes 
whanne þei ben manye. 
Þanne it is to wetynge 
þat þe nombre of schiltroms 
scholde be iordeyned 
by þe multitude of fiƷtynge men. 
For as þe duk haþ mo fiƷtynge men oþer lees, 
he may ordeyne mo schiltroms oþer lees. 
And it is to wetynge þat alwey 
in a corner of a schiltrom, 
oþer in place 
where most perel may falle leste þe schiltrom 
be toschad 
oþer imedled oþer wise 
þan it scholde, 
scholde be sette best werriours 
þat may beste fiƷte. 
And so it is to wetynge þat in eche schiltrom, 
al wiþoute fiƷtynge men 
þat ben in þe schiltrom, 
som noble and orpede fiƷtynge men 
scholde be ordeyned wiþoute þe schiltrom 
þat þey mowe helpe þe schiltrom Ʒif it failleþ in eny place. 
And þes þre scholde be kept 
in ordeynyng of schiltroms. First, 
þat þe schiltrom 
be wel iordeyned 
ischape al round oþer 
as a scheld oþer as a schere, 
as it nedeþ for þe bataile 
þat schal be Ʒeue. 
Þe seconde, 
þat þe beste fiƷtynge men ben i[s]ette 
in þilke place of þe schiltrom 
in þe whiche þe schiltrom 
myƷt sonnest be broke. 
Þe þridde, 
þat wiþoute eche schiltrom be iordeyned 
som boolde knyƷtes and stronge 
þat may helpe 
þat partie of þe schiltrom 
þat is feeble and faylleþ. 
Capitulum terciodecimum tercii libri partis tercii. Chapter XIII 
For it is declared how schiltromes 
scholde be ordeyned and isett, 
it is to declarynge 
how fiƷtynge men scholde fiƷte and smyte, 
and wheþer it is better to smyte drawynge 
oþer stokynge. 
And we may preue by fyue weyes 
þat þei ben to scornynge 
þat smyten drawynge 
and þat it is best 
to smyte stokynge and foynynge. 
Þe firste wey is itake 
by lette of armere, 
þe seconde by lette of boones, 
þe þridde by warnesse of wondes, 
þe ferþe by traueille of lymes, 
þe fifte by vnhelyng of hem þat smyten. 
Þe firste is declared in þis wise. 
For þe [more] a swerd takeþ of þe armere, 
for lettyng of þe armere 
þe hardere it is to come to þe flesch. 
And þerfore wise fiƷtynge men 
þat hauen experience of bataille meneþ 
þat alwey fiƷtynge men 
scholde haue large haburiounis 
so þat rynges to of haboriones 
scholde be constreyned togeders; 
for þe more þykke þe ringes ben isette, 
þe more þerof mote breke Ʒif wondes scholde greue. 
So for þei þat smyten drawynge mote forkytte more of þe armere 
þan þei þat smyten stokynge and foynyng Ʒif þe wondes scholde come to þe flesche, 
þanne it is better to smyte foynynge þanne drawynge. 
And a litel keruyng of armere suffiseþ to herte þe flesche 
smytyng foynyng 
þat suffiseþ not smytynge drawynge. 
Þe seconde wey to preue 
þe same is itake 
by lettynge of bones. 
For þei a man be 
as it were vnarmed 
in smytynge drawynge, 
ar me come to þe herte 
and to þe membres of lif, 
moste a greet wonde be maad 
and manye bones forkytte. 
But smytynge foynynge twey ynches suffiseþ to deþ wounde. 
Þanne we schal take hede þat al þat is greuous to oure enemyes is profitable to vs. 
Þerfore in an oost 
þer men fondeþ to | slee, 
me scholde fiƷte foynyng; 
for smytynge in þat wise deeþ wounde is sonnest iƷeue. 
Þe þridde is itake by warnesse of wondes. 
For þe more waar þe enemy is of wondes, 
þe bettre he may defende hym 
and voide hem þe sonnere. 
For Ʒif a man is iwaar of dartes, 
þe dartes greueþ þe lasse. 
And in smytynge drawynge, 
for þer mot bee greet meuynge of armes 
ar þe strook come to þe enemye, 
he may be longe waar of þe woundes; he may þerfore be þe more waar 
and defende hymself fro strokes. 
Þerfore Vigesius seith þat smytynge foynynge 
þe enemye feleþ þe strook 
er he see it comynge. 
Þerfore knyƷtes of Rome 
vsede principaliche 
þis manere smytynge 
and smote selde drawynge, 
for þei wolde alwey smyte foynyng. 
Þe ferþe wey is itake 
by traueile of lymes. 
For among oþere thinges in bataille, 
þat scholde be principaliche iknowe how fiƷtynge men 
wiþoute greet traueille 
mowe greue here enemyes. 
For Ʒif fiƷtynge men trauelen tofore 
and mowe not dure þat traueille, 
þei forsaken þe schiltrom 
and bygynnen to flee. 
Þanne for in smytynge drawynge is greet traueile 
by cause of meuyng of armes 
and in smytynge foynynge litel traueille suffiseþ, 
þanne it is bettere 
to smyte foynyng þan drawyng. <For> a drawyng strook sleeþ 
but selde þeiƷ it come with greet strengþe; 
but a foynyng strook þei it come 
wiþ litel strengþe Ʒeueþ deþes wonde. 
Þe fifte wey is itake 
by vnhelyng of hym þat smyteþ. 
For a good werriour scholde so smyte his enemye 
Ʒif he may so 
þat he be not ihurt. 
Þanne alle | suche manere smytyng 
is best 
in þe whiche he 
þat smyteþ is leest vnheled, 
for in suche smytyng may falle lest hertynge. 
Þanne for smytyng foynynge 
and with þe body yheled may be lest hertynge, 
betere it is to smyte foynyng þan drawyng. 
For in smytynge drawyng it 
nedeþ to heue vp þe riƷt arme; 
and whanne þe riƷt arme is vp, 
þe riƷt side is naked 
and vnheled 
and þe enemy haþ mater 
to herte and greue þe sonnere. 
For þe body 
þat is naked is sonnere 
ihert and igreued 
þan þe body 
þat is iheled. Chapter XIV 
And as it is iseid tofore, 
what is profitable to enemyes 
is greuous to vs and aƷenward. 
Þanne al þat makeþ 
þe enemyes stronge to withstonde fiƷtynge men 
is profitable to hem. 
Þerfore þe contrarie 
is greuous to hem 
and makeþ hem feble to wiþstonde fiƷtynge men. 
And as it longeþ to þis doyng, 
we may rekene seuene 
þat makeþ enemyes more strong 
þan þe oþer partie. 
Þe firste is Ʒif þei ben wel iordeyned in þe schiltrom. 
For as it is iseid tofore, 
a vertue is more strong 
whanne it is ioned 
þan whanne it is departed. 
Þan Ʒif enemyes ben wel ioned and wel iordeyned and isette in good ordre in schiltrom, 
Ʒif þei ben assailled, 
þei ben þe hardere to be ouercome. 
Þe seconde þat makeþ enemyes stronge to wiþstonde is place; 
for in oo place enemyes 
mow betere defende hemself 
þan in anoþer. 
For in passyng of reueres 
and among hulles and monteyns 
and in strayte weyes, 
‡ Ʒif þei ben ifounde in suche place, 
it is hard to hem 
for to defende hemself 
for þei mot goo sparpoyled and | departed. 
Wherfore Ʒif enemyes ben ifounde in place 
þat is not defensable, 
þe place makeþ hem 
þe more feble to fiƷte. 
So a place of defence makeþ hem 
þe more strong to wiþstonde. 
Þe þridde [is] tyme. 
For whanne þe wynd is aƷenste enemyes 
and whanne poudre is iblow in here eyƷen and whanne þe sonne beem 
is in here face, 
enemyes mowe þe worse wiþstonde. 
And whanne þe contrarie herof falleþ, 
enemyes ben þe more strong to fiƷte. 
Þe ferþe þat makeþ enemyes 
þe more bolde 
and þe more redy to fiƷte is warnynge. 
For whanne þei ben waar and avised and knoweþ 
tofore þe comynge of enemyes, 
a‡ maken hem þe more strong 
and dreden þe lasse þe metynge of hem. 
Þe fifte is skilful reste. 
For whanne enemyes ben wery of traueile and igreued 
wiþ wakyng and wiþ oþere deseses, 
Ʒif þei ben þanne assailled, 
þei ben sonnere ouercome 
þanne þey scholde Ʒif þei hadde skilful reste. 
Þanne skilful reste makeþ enemyes 
þe more strong and myƷty. 
Þe sixte is loue and accorde of hemself. 
For Ʒif enemyes 
þat ben bodiliche departed 
ben þe sonnere ouercome, 
moche more Ʒif þei ben departed in loue and in wille 
þei ben þe sonnere ouercome. 
For departyng and deuysioun of loue 
and of wille is more þanne deuysioun of bodies. 
And ‡ aƷenward Ʒif enemyes ben bodiliche ioned, 
þei ben þe strengere to fiƷte; 
and moche more Ʒif þei louen eche oþer 
and ben ioned in loue and in wille, 
for þanne | ‡ he tristeþ 
þe more to eche oþer [and] 
þey ben þe more strong 
and wiþ good confort redy to fiƷte. 
For eche loue 
is a certeyne vertue of onynge, 
and loue oneþ more þe hertes of hem 
þat loueþ þanne vnyte of place 
oneþ þe bodyes of hem 
þat ben þere inne. 
Wherfore Ʒif vnytee of place 
and gederyng of fiƷtyng men maken hem 
þe more strong and myƷty, 
loue and vnyte of hertes makeþ hem þe more manlich and strong. 
Þe seuenþe 
þat makeþ enemyes 
þe more strong to wiþstonde [i]s [vn]k[n]owynge 
of here owne condicions 
and of here owne doynge. 
For þe better þe condicions of enemyes ben iknowe, 
þe liƷtere we[y] 
may be chese 
by þe whiche þei mow be ouercome. 
And þe more vnknowe is here doynge, 
þe more vnknowe is þe manere to asseyle hem. 
And so for thinges ben irekened 
þat makeþ þe enemyes 
þe more strong to wiþstonde, 
it may be sone iknowe how and in what wise werriours scholde falle on here enemyes. 
For in seuene manere doynges 
þat ben irekened 
ene[m]yes ben þe more strong, 
whanne þei ben in þe contrarie manere of doyng 
þanne þei scholde be assayled. 
Þanne firste, 
by buschementes oþer 
by som oþer maner of doynge 
þe duke of þe bataille 
scholde besyliche aspie 
whanne þe enemyes ben departed. 
And þanne þei scholde asaile hem, 
for þanne þei hauen no myƷt to wiþstonde. 
Þe seconde, [þei] scholde besiliche aspie here weyes; 
as whanne he passede ryuers 
and strayte weyes among monteyns 
oþer among wodes oþere euel weyes of mareys and mores, 
þanne þei scholde falle on enemyes 
for <so> [eþeliche] 
þei ben ouercome. 
Þe þrid|de, 
þei scholde take hede of þe tyme; 
as whanne þe sonne 
is in þe eyƷene 
and whanne þe wynd bloweþ 
doust on here face, 
þanne þei scholde sette on hem. 
For here eyƷen ben iblend wiþ 
þe sonne and igreued wiþ wynd and wiþ poudre, 
þey mow not wel iseye hou 
þei scholde wel fiƷte. 
And þerfore hem nedeþ to tume þe bak and be agoo. 
Þe ferþe, 
þe duk of þe oost scholde do 
þat his knyƷtes and fiƷtynge men ete and drynke 
and reste and make here hors reste so 
þat þei mow come 
on here enemyes vnwar and assayle hem 
whan þei eten oþer 
whan þei slepen, 
whanne þei holden hemself siker, 
and ben vnarmed 
and bare fot and ba[r]e [llegged, 
and here hors vnsadeled, 
and hauen noun suspecioun 
of here comynge. 
Þe fifþe, 
þei scholde besiliche aspie 
whanne þe enemyes 
hauen imaad greet ioumay 
and ben wery 
and here hors ben wery. 
For þanne Ʒif þei ben assailled, 
þei wollen sone tume þe backe. 
Þe sixte, 
as Vigesius seith, 
De Re Militari, þe duk of þe bataille schal by hymself oþer by oþer make strif, discorde, debate among his enemyes 
so þat noon of hem tristeþ on oþer. 
For whan þat is ido, 
for noon of hem tristeþ to oþer, 
Ʒif þei ben assailled 
þei tumen sone þe bak. 
But þei Vigesius sette þis cautel, 
it is litel worþ, 
for it is contrarie 
to goode maners and þewes. 
Þe seuenþe, 
þei scholde besiliche aspie 
þe condicions of enemyes, 
how þei beren hemself, 
hoo is heere duke and ledere, 
and to wham þe duke tristeþ most, 
and what maners hee vseþ. 
For Ʒif alle condicions of enemyes ben iknowe, 
it may be þe sonnere iknowe 
how þei | myƷte be assailled and ouercome. Chapter XV 
We seide in þe chapitre tofore 
þat it is to smytyng foynynge 
and not drawynge, 
in whiche chapitre we tauƷte boþe knyƷtes and foot men. 
In þis chapitre we wol Ʒeue special loore to foot men, 
how þei scholde stonde 
whanne þei wollen smyte enemyes. 
And of smyytyng of enemyes is double manere, 
on afeere throwyng dartes 
and anoþer whanne þei ben so nyƷ þat þey fiƷten hond at honde. 
And fiƷtynge men schullen oþer wise stonde 
whanne þei ben afeer 
and þrowen dartes 
þanne þei scholde stonde 
whanne þey ben nyƷ and fiƷten hond at honde. 
For stondyng afeer 
and þrowyng dartes and gauelockes 
þei schold haue þe riƷt foot byhynde. 
For þe herte 
þat is welle of meuyng 
in a beest Ʒeueþ most principaliche influence 
in to þe riƷt side 
so þat þe riƷt side 
in a best is more strong in meuynge 
and more able to meue. 
And for alwey þyng þat meueþ leneeþ 
on som what þat meueþ not – 
as Ʒif þe hond meueþ and not þe arme, 
þe hond þat meueþ leneeþ on þe arme 
þat meueþ not; 
and Ʒif þe arme meueþ, 
it lenyeþ to þe bodye þat resteþ; 
and Ʒif on foot meueþ, 
it lenyeþ on þe oþer foot 
þat meueþ not – it nedeþ 
þat whanne þe riƷt side meueþ, 
þat it lenye vppon þe lift side þat resteþ. 
Þanne whanne þe lift foot 
is sette tofore 
and þe riƷt side sum deel bacward, 
þanne a man is best disposed to þrowe dartes. 
For þanne þei resten on þe lift side 
and meuen in to þe riƷt side schakynge þe dart. 
And whanne þe dart is ischake, 
it moueþ þe ayer þe more strongliche 
and Ʒeueþ þe hardere strook. 
And þeyƷ we may reste and meuy boþe | 
on þe riƷt side 
and on þe lift side, 
Ʒut þe riƷt side 
is more able to meuynge 
and þe lift side to restynge. 
Þerfore smytynge 
af[e]er we scholde reste oon þe lift foot 
isette tofore and wiþdrawe þe riƷt foot 
þat we may þe more strongliche schake 
and þrowe þe dart. 
But whanne we fiƷten hond 
at honde with swerd, 
we schul do agenward 
and sette forþ aƷenward þe riƷt foot and wiþdrawe þe lift foot. 
For þe r¿Ʒt side 
is more able to meuynge, 
Ʒif þat side is next to þe enemye 
by cause of meuynge 
it may þe bettere voide strokes; 
for þyng þat moueþ 
not is hardere ismete 
þan þyng þat meueþ. 
Also Ʒif þe riƷt side 
is next to þe enemye, 
it may þe bettere smyte. 
For whanne fiƷtynge men fiƷten hond at hond, 
þe ‡ lift foot scholde not meue; 
and whan þei wol smyte, 
þei scholde sette forþ þe riƷt foot; 
and whanne þey wollen voide þe strokes, 
þey scholde wiþdrawe þe same riƷt foot. 
And so stondynge on þe lift foot 
and settyng forþ 
and wiþdrawynge þe riƷt foot, 
þei moste smyte þe better strokes 
and þe better voide þe strokes. 
For it is iknowe how fiƷtynge men schulde st[onde] 
whanne þei schulde smyte enemyes, 
it is to declarynge how enemyes 
scholde be clipped and iclosed. 
Þanne it is to wetynge 
þat selde oþer neuer enemyes 
scholde be so iclipped and closed ‡ 
in bataille of areste þat þei haue no wey for to flee. 
For þanne þei knowen non 
oþer socour 
but þat þei mot nedes fiƷte oþer be deed and ben þerfore hardy. 
And knowyng þat þei mot nedes deyƷe, 
þei 
m[ow]e do moche harme to hem 
þat fiƷten wiþ hem. 
Þerfore Cipiones sen|tens is ipreysed, 
for he seideþat neuere enemyes 
scholde be so iclosed and icleped 
þat þei haue no wey for to fle. 
For þei enemyes flee, 
it is no perel. 
Also in þe fliƷt manye of hem 
ben in peril 
and ilost wiþowte here strokes þat chaseþ hem. 
And Ʒif þei seen 
þat þei ben icleped and iclosed, 
þei ben as it were constrayned 
and compelled to fiƷte wiþ here enemyes 
þat clo<s>en hem. 
Þanne for we seide 
þat som tyme a schiltrom scholde be ischape 
as a schere as whan enemyes ben fewe for to byclippe hem and close hem 
þe betere, 
it schal not be vnderstonde 
so þat enemyes schul be so iclosed and iclipped 
þat þei haue no wey for to flee 
but þei ben so fewe 
þat þei mowe do noon harme 
þei he be neuere so rebel. 
For it is declared how fiƷtynge foot men 
scholde stonde to smyte here enemyes 
and how enemyes 
scholde be byclipped and closed, 
now, þe þridde, 
it is to declarynge how fiƷtynge ‡ scholde be voided Ʒif þer lakkeþ counsaille 
oþer Ʒif it semeþ 
þat it is not good 
to Ʒeue batayle for enemyes 
beþ to manye 
and we mowe not wiþstonde hem. 
In þe whiche caas 
as it longeþ 
to þis doynge þe duke of þe bataille 
scholde haue double cautel. 
Þe first, 
touchinge his owne oost. 
For Ʒif þe duk haþ counsaille 
þat it is not to doynge for to fiƷte, 
Ʒit riƷt fewe scholde wete þerof. 
And not al þe oost 
scholde wete þerof 
lest þei drede and flee awey schameliche 
and be kylde of enemyes 
þat pursewen hem. Also þe duke scholde so bere hym 
þat þe oost trowe not þat he wolde flee 
but þat he | wol araye boschementes 
aƷenste þe enemyes 
and fiƷte wiþ hem in oþer place. 
Þe seconde cautel is touchyng þe oost of enemyes. 
For Ʒif þei wol voide þe bataille, 
for to make þat vnknowe 
to þe enemyes 
þerfore manye by nyƷtes more 
þan by dayes don so. 
And manye hauen ivsed þis cautel 
þat knyötes stondyng 
in þe schiltrom 
aforne þe enemyes schulde lette þe enemyes 
to see þe foot men; 
wherfore þe foot men passen awey preuelyche. 
And whanne þei ben agoo, 
afterward hors men mowe þe better voide periles and strokes of enemyes. 
And it is to wetynge 
þat whanne a bataille 
is so ivoided, 
þe schiltrom scholde not be departed. 
For Ʒif enemyes pursewen hem 
þat flien fro þe bataille, 
þei wolde slee moo 
and do hem more harme 
þan þeiƷ he tumede aƷen for to fiƷte. 
And so þe duke of þe bataille 
scholde inquire Ʒif þer is eny place nyƷ 
to þe whiche þe oost may flee an‡ it be ichased wiþ enemyes. Chapter XVI Hit semeþ 
þat alle batailles ben reducte and ibrouƷt 
to foure maners of batailes: 
þe batailes of feeld, of sege, of defence, and of schippes. 
And bataille of feld is icleped al fiƷtynge 
þat is in ground 
in þe whichemen fiƷteþ togederswiþoute strenþe of closynge bytwene hem. 
And þe lasse strengþe of closynge is bytwene hem, 
þe more verreyliche it is icleped bataille of feld 
and is þe more perelous. 
Þe seconde manere offiƷtynge 
is icleped obcessiuum, 
a sege, 
whanne fiƷtynge men ben so strong 
þat þei abyden not forto þe enemyes come out of here 
strengþe to fiƷte wiþ hem | in þe felde, 
but þei fallen on þe strengþe 
and bysege hem þerinne. 
And suche fiƷtynge is comynliche icleped obcessiuum, fiƷtynge of sege. 
And þe þridde manere fiƷtynge may be cleped defensiuum, fiƷtynge of defence. 
For as som tyme fiƷtynge men ben so manye and so strong 
þat þei abyden not forto þe enemyes come out 
in to þe feld 
but þei assayllen and bysegen þe strengþe, 
so som tyme fiƷtynge men ben so fewe and so feble 
þat þei trowen not 
þat þei mowe wiþstonde þe enemyes 
in þe felde 
and holden hem þerfore iclosed in strengþe. 
And it is inow to hem to defende þe strengþe 
Ʒif þei ben assailed of enemyes. 
And suche fiƷtyng in þe which men defenden strengþes and castels 
is icleped defensiuum; 
for þei in eche fiƷtynge be som asailynge and som defence, 
Ʒut whanne men bysegen strengþes and castels, 
it is more propreliche iseid 
þat þei assaillen 
oþere men þanne 
þat þei defenden. 
And in fiƷtynge of defence 
is not assaillyng but defence. 
Þerfore suche fiƷtynge 
is icleped defensiuum, 
fiƷtyng of defence. 
Þe ferþe manere bataille 
oþer fiƷtynge is icleped a bataille of schippes. 
For as fiƷtynge is in þe londe, 
so is fiƷtyng in watre. 
And fiƷtyng in watre is more orible and perelous þan fiƷtynge in þe lond. 
And suche fiƷtynge in water, 
what maner water it euere be, 
is icleped bataille of schippes. 
Wherfore Ʒif þer ben foure manere of fiƷtynge, 
after þat we hauen ispoke of fiƷtyng of feld, 
it is to spekynge of fiƷtynge of sege, of defence, and of schippes. 
And som tyme kynges and prynces fiƷten 
in þes maners of fiƷtynge, 
for som tyme þei Ʒeuen bataille 
in þe feld 
and | bysegen som tyme strengþes and castels. 
Also som tyme som men asaylen strenþes and castels of oþere men; 
þerfore hem nedeþ 
to vse fiƷtynge of defence. 
Also in principate and in regne ben hauenes 
and lond nyƷ þe see. 
Þerfore lest hauenes be destroyed 
and lest enemyes come 
þerby in to þe regne 
and lest þe lond 
þat is nyƷ þe see be destroyed, 
it is spedful to kynges and princes 
to ordeyne batailles of schippes. 
Also for it is ispoke of bataille of felde, 
it is to spekynge of oþere manere batailles. 
And for we hauen ispoke largeliche of bataille of felde 
and irekened manye cautels of batailes – for by thinges 
þat ben iseid 
it is iknowe 
þat in alle manere batailles 
mowe be cautels 
how men scholde bere hem 
and in what wise – now it 
nedeþ to abyde lengere aboute oþere manere batailles. 
But first we schal speke of bataille of sege. 
Þanne for it is iknowe 
how manye manere of batailles þer ben, 
and iseide after bataille of feld 
it is first to spekyng of fiƷtyng of sege 
(for by suche fiƷtynge strengþes, castels, citees, 
and wallede townes ben itake), 
it is to spekynge 
in how manye manere wyse suche strengþes mow be ouercome and itake. 
And in þre manere wise strengþes and castels mowe be take: 
by þurst, hunger and fiƷtynge. 
For som tyme þei þat ben byseged 
lakken water and mote þerfore deyƷe for þurst 
oþer Ʒelde vp þe strengþe. 
Wherfore þei þat bysegen 
eny strengþes 
mote besiliche byþenke Ʒif þei mowe by eny quyntyse oþer by sleyþe 
byneme here water 
þat is byseged. 
For | ofte it happeþ 
þat water comeþ 
fro ferre welles to þe strengþe 
þat ben byseged. 
Wherfore Ʒif þe pipe 
and þe condite 
by þe whiche suche water comeþ 
to hem þat ben byseged is destroyed 
at þe welle heed, 
þanne þey þat ben byseged 
mote nedes haue defaute of water. 
Also som strengþes stonden hiƷe and hauen no water 
comyng fro ferre welles. 
Þanne þei þat bysegen hem scholde do al besynesse to knowe 
in what wise þei mow byneme here water 
þat ben byseged. 
Þe seconde manere of takynge of strengþes 
is by honger, 
for wiþoute mete we may not dure. 
Þerfore he þat bysegeþ strengþes 
for to take hem 
scholde besiliche kepe paas and weyes 
and alle places 
by þe whiche mete myƷte be brouƷt hem, 
and kepe besiliche þat no mete be brouƷt to hem. 
For ofte in suche seges honger doþ more harme þan swerdes. 
Þerfore ofte tyme þei 
þat bysegen and wol sone take þe strengþes 
Ʒif þei taken eny of hem 
þat ben byseged 
þey sleeþ hem not, 
but maymeþ hem and makeþ hem 
vnable to fiƷte 
and sendeþ hem 
þanne to þe strengþes 
þat is byseged for to ete þer wyth hem 
þat ben byseged 
and to make hem 
haue þe more defaute and honger. 
Þe þridde manere of takynge of strengþes is by fiƷtynge, 
as whanne me comeþ 
to þe walles for to fiƷte wiþ hem 
þat ben byseged. 
But how and in how manye manere wise suche fiƷtynge scholde be, 
it schal be declared 
in þe nexte chapitre. 
For it is declared how manye maner batailles 
þer ben 
and in how manye manere wise strengþes 
þat ben byseged ben itake, 
| it is to declarenge what tyme 
it is best to bysege castels and citees. 
And so it is to wetynge 
þat in somer tyme, 
þat er come and wyne ben gedred 
and oþere þynges 
þat neden to here liflode 
þat ben byseged, 
[it is best to sette a sege]. For in þat tyme 
in al maner takynge of strengþes 
þe strengþe 
is best itake 
and þei þat ben byseged ben ouercome. 
For Ʒif strengþes ben itake by þrist, 
it is best to sette a sege in somer tyme. 
For þanne is most defaute of water 
and þanne is not moche rayne 
þat may be cisternes 
helpe hem 
þat ben byseged. 
Also Ʒif castels and citees ben itake by honger, 
it is best to sette a sege in somer tyme. 
For comynliche þanne faillen 
fruyt of þe gere þat is agoo. 
Wherfore Ʒif þei þat ben byseged mowe not haue þe fmyt of þe Ʒere þat is present, 
þei ben þe sonnere ispilt for defaute and for honger. 
Also Ʒif strengþes ben itake by bataille and by fiƷtynge, 
it is best to do it in somer tyme. 
For in wynter tyme 
is moche rayne 
and diches ben ful of water, 
wherfore it is þe more ‡ hard to assaille hem 
þat ben byseged. 
Also desese of tyme greueþ more hem þat bysegeþ 
and ben in þe feld þan hem 
þat ben byseged 
and ben in hous. 
Þanne seges scholde be isette in somer tyme. 
Oþer Ʒif seges schal dure longe tyme, 
þey scholde nameliche be bygonne in somer tyme ar þei þat ben byseged mowe gedre com and wyne and oþere fmyt of þe erþe. Chapter XVII Ʒif men þat bysegen ben necligent and strengtheþ 
not hemsilf besiliche, 
men þat ben byseged may greue hem. 
For whanne a sege dureþ longe tyme, 
it is not possible 
þat men of þe sege be al|wey ileche wel arayed and redy to fiƷte. 
Þerfore but þei haue strengþe aboute hem 
whanne þei ben aslepe oþer 
atte mete oþer in oþer nedes, 
men of þe castel breken sodeynliche out vpon hem 
and brennen here tentes and destroyen here 
gynnes and som tyme sleen manye of þe sege. 
Þanne for to be siker, 
þe sege scholde by sette and tentes ipiƷt fer fro þe place 
þat is byseged – namelich as fer as þe fliƷt of a dart oþer of an arwe. 
And þe men of þe sege scholde make diches aboute hem 
and piche þerinne stakes and poles 
and make torettes and pynacles 
so þat Ʒif þe men 
þat ben byseged wolde sodeynliche assaille hem, 
þei mowe fynde lette. 
For it is iknowe how men of a sege scholde make hem strengþe for þei 
þat ben byseged scholde not greue hem, 
it is to declarynge 
in how manye manere wise þei mow assaille hem 
þat ben byseged. 
And oon manere of assaillynge is comyne: 
wiþ arblasters, wiþ bowes, 
and with stones 
iþrowe wiþ hondes 
and with slynges, 
and wiþ ladders isette to þe strengþe. 
Ʒif þei þat ben byseged comen to þe walles and penacles, 
Ʒif men of þe sege ben connyng in fiƷtynge, 
anoun þey wolle assayle hem 
wiþ arblastes and bowes 
and wiþ stones 
iþrowe wiþ hondes 
and wiþ slenges and sette ladders to þe walles. 
Al wiþoute þes maners of assaylyng and sautes 
ben þre maners of sautes 
and of assaylyng 
þat may be knowe to alle men. 
On þerof is by mynes 
and by weyes vnder erþe, 
and anoþer by engynes 
þrowyng grete stones and heuye, 
and þe þridde 
is by buldynge ischift to þe walles 
of þe strengþe 
þat is byseged. 
And of al þes maners of asayllynge and sautes | 
we schal speke 
and first of assaylyng 
by weyes vnder erþe. 
And first strengþes ben itake 
by mynes 
and weyes vnder erþe. 
For þey þat ben in þe sege scholde pryueyliche 
in som place delue and digge in þe erþe, 
and þei scholde sette tofore 
þat place a tente oþer som oþer buldyng so 
þat þei þat ben byseged mow not isee 
where þat þei bygynnen to delue. 
And þere deluyng and mynyng and makyng weyes 
vnder erþe 
as mynours doþ 
þat mynen siluer and fynden veynes of metal, 
þei schulde make þulke weyes deppere 
þan þe diches and walles of þe strengþe 
þei schal betake 
and come by suche weyes anon to þe walles 
of þe forseide strengþe. 
And Ʒif þat may be do, 
þe strengþe is sone itake. 
For whanne þat is ido, 
first þei scholde vnderf━myn┐e þe walles and vndersette hem 
wiþ tymber and wiþ treen 
þat þe walles falle not anon. 
And whanne alle þe walles 
ben so vndermyned and vndersette, 
Ʒif þei þat ben of þe sege knowen 
þat þe strengþe may be take onliche 
by fallyng of þe walle, 
þanne þei scholde anoon sette þe tymber afuyre 
þat vndersetteþ and bereþ þe wal 
and make alle þe walles 
oþer a greet del þerof falle al at ones and fille þe diches. 
And whanne þat is idoo, 
þei scholde as it were sodeynliche afraye hem 
þat ben byseged 
þat þe strengþe 
may þe sonnere be take. 
And it is to wetynge 
þat alwey þe weyes 
vnder erþe scholde be strengþed 
wiþ tymber and wiþ bordes leste þe erþe falle and stoffe mynours. 
And þe erþe þat is idrawe 
out of þe myne scholde be so preueyliche 
i|hid þat it be not iseye of hem 
þat ben byseged. 
And also whanne þe tymber 
þat vndersetteþ and holdeþ 
vp þe walles is iset afire, 
he þat setteþ swiche tymber 
afuyre mot drawe hem 
to a siker place 
lest he be ihert with fallyng of þe walle. 
Þanne in þis wise it isto doynge in takynge ofstrengþes 
by menynge whanne onliche fallyng of þe walles 
suffiseþ to take þe strengþe. 
But whanne me troweþ 
þat suffiseþ not, 
while þe walles ben vndermened 
and vndersette þe tymber scholde not be set afuyre anoon; 
but me scholde passe furþere 
to grettere strengþes 
and to þe strengest walles of castel oþer of citee 
þat is byseged ánd do 
in þe same wise 
by suche weyes vnder erþe 
as it is ido touchinge þe walles. 
Also þe weyes vnder erþe schulde be so tumed þat men mow come þerby 
in to þe castel oþer citee. 
And al þis may be do preueyliche 
wiþoute wetyng of hem 
þat ben byseged. 
And þey it be not ido 
wiþoute difficultee and longe tyme, 
al þis may be brouƷt to good ende. 
And whan al þis is idoo som tyme 
by nygte oþer som oþer tyme 
þat is couenable 
to fiƷte þe tymber scholde be sette afuyre þat holdeþ 
vp þe walles so 
þat alle þe walles 
of þe strengþe fal doun 
at tones and fille þe diches. 
And also me may come 
by weyes vnder erþe, 
and somme of þe sege may come in to þe castel 
oþer citee by wey 
þat is imaad 
by fallynge of þe walles. 
And so þe strengþe 
þat is byseged may be take. Chapter XVIII 
And it happeþ often tyme þat strengþes 
þat ben byseged stonden on harde 
sto|nes oþer ben byclipped 
al aboute wiþ water 
so þat vnneþe oþer neuere þei mow be take wiþ menyng. 
Also ofte it happeþ 
þat þei a strengþe þat is byseged 
may be take by menyng, Ʒit [þei] ‡ 
þat ben byseged ben waar of þe menyng and letteþ it 
þat þei be not gylelich ouercome þerby. 
And how þat scholde be do we schal teche here 
after in þe tretes of fiƷtyng of defence. 
For whanne it schal be treted how þei þat ben byseged scholde defende hemself, 
it schal be declared how þei þat ben byseged mowe be waar of mynes 
and of oþere wyles of hem 
þat bysegen hem. 
Wherfore Ʒif þe manere of craft scholde folwe kynde þat alwey bryngeþ forþ þynges 
by þe schorteste wey, 
for strengþes ben not so sone itake 
by mynes 
and by engynes and trepegettes 
þat þrowen stones oþer by buldynges ischift anoon to þe walles of castel 
oþer of citee 
þat is byseged, 
it nedeþ to vse suche argumentes 
for to haue þe entente. 
Þanne it is to wetynge 
how manye maner gynnes 
þer ben to þrowe stones 
and how manye manere buldynges 
by þe whiche strengþes 
ben assayled and itake. 
And þe gynnes to þrowe stones 
ben reducte 
as it were to foure manere gynnes. 
For in eche suche maner gyn 
is som what þat draweþ and rereþ þe Ʒerde of þe gynne 
to þe whiche is iioyned 
a slenge þat þroweþ stones. 
And suche is þe reryng of þe Ʒerd 
som tyme by conterpaise, 
and [oþer while þat conterpaise 
nis suffisaunt 
but þe Ʒerde ofþe gynne be rered 
forþere wiþ ropes, 
by þe which reryng þe stones are iþrowe. 
Þanne Ʒif suche þrowyng be wiþ oon 
conterpaise,] þat conterpaise 
it is ipiƷt oþer meuable 
oþer som del ipiƷt 
and som del meuable. 
And it is iseid 
þat þe counterpeyse 
is ipiƷt whanne in þe Ʒerde 
is ipiƷt a cassa þat is fast 
wiþ|owte meuynge to þe Ʒerd ful of stones 
oþer of grauel 
oþer of leed 
oþer of som oþer heuye þynges. 
And men in ool tyme clepede þis manere gyne trabicium. 
And among gynnes þis gynne þroweþ most euene, 
for alwey þe contrepeyse draweþ ileche. 
Þerfore it þroweþ alwey in þe same wise and wiþ þis gyne a nedle may be smete. 
For whanne me schal þerwiþ þrowe to eny mark, 
Ʒif it þroweþ to moche toward þe riƷt side 
oþer toward þe lift side, 
it schal be itumed and isette afome þe place to þe whiche þe stoon schal be þrowe. 
And Ʒif it þroweþ to hiƷe, 
it schal be sette forþere oþer 
a more heuy stoon ido þerinne þat it may not arere so hie. 
And Ʒif it þroweþ so lowe, 
þe gyne it schal be sette nere 
oþer a more liƷt stoon ido þerinne. 
And alwey þe stones schal be weye 
þat schal be þrowe to eny mark with suche gynes. 
Anoþer manere gyne haþ contrepayse faste withoute changynge to þe swengel 
oþer to þe Ʒerd of þe gyne, 
tumynge aboute suche a Ʒerd. 
And þe werriours of Rome clepede such a gyne bypha. 
And þis gyne is oþer þan þe gyne 
þat hatte trabicium, 
for þe countrepeyse is fast to þe Ʒerde of þe gyne. 
PeiƷ it drawe þe more 
by cause of meuynge, 
but it draweþ not so ileche, 
þerfore it þroweþ forþere and more 
but not so euene, 
so certeynliche. 
Þe þridde manere gyne hatte tripantum and haþ eyþer countrepayse fast to þe Ʒerd 
and þe oon ‡meuable tumyng þere aboute. 
And by cause þat þe contrepeyse is fast, 
þis manere gyne þroweþ more euene 
þan þe gyne þat hatte bypha. 
And by cau|se of þe peyse 
þat moueþ and tumeþ aboute, 
it þroweþ forþere þan þe gyne 
þat hatte trabicium. 
Þe ferþe manere gyne [a] 
in stede of contrepeyse ropes 
þat ben idrawe by strengþe of hondes of men. 
An suche a gyne þroweþ not so grete stones 
as þe forseide þre manere gynes, 
naþeles to raye stones for þe gyne 
nedeþ not so greet tyme 
as it nedeþ to þe forseyde gynes, 
so þat þis gyne þroweþ 
sonnere and oftere and more spedyliche 
þan þe forsayde gynes. 
Þanne he þat wol bysege a castel 
oþer a cite, 
Ʒif he wol assaille and wynne þe strengþe by gynes 
þat þrowen stones, 
he schal besiliche take hede wheþer 
he may better wynne þe strengþe 
þrowyng euene oþer fer, 
oþer in mene manere bytwene tweyne oþer, 
also wheþer he may more greue hem 
þat ben byseged þrowyng ofte oþer selde. 
For as hym semeþ 
þat it is spedful 
with al þes manere gynes 
and in alle þe forseyde manere wise, 
stones may be þrowe. 
And som tyme wiþoute eny of þe forseyde gynnes castels oþer citee 
þat is byseged 
may be assaylled and iwonne. 
And Ʒif þe forseide gynnes 
of þe whiche we made mencioun ben iknowe at folle, 
it schal be knowe 
at þe ful hou by gynnes 
þat þrowen stones 
eche strengþe may be assailed and iwonne. 
For eche manere gynne þat þroweþ stones 
is oon of þe forseide gynes oþer may ben imaad 
by som liknesse of somme þerof. 
Also it is to wetynge 
þat boþe by day and nyƷte by gynes 
þat þrowen stones strengþes 
þat ben byseged mowe be assailled and itake. 
Nathales for to see how gynes smyten 
by nygte wiþ stones 
þat þrowen, 
alwey fuyre | oþer a brond mot be fast to þe stoon. 
For by a fuyry brond 
ifastned to þe stoon 
it may be knowe how þe gyne þroweþ 
and how heuy a stoon scholde be doo in þe slynge. Chapter XIX Tofore were itouched 
þre maners of assayllynge 
and takynge of strengþes 
þat ben byseged. 
Oon þer of is by mynes 
and by weyes vnder erþe; 
þe oþer, 
by gynes þat þrowen stones; 
and þe þridde by buldyng ischift 
to þe walles 
of þe strengþe 
þat is byseged. 
Þanne for it is ispoke of asaylyng 
by mynes 
and by gynes 
þat þrowen stones, 
it is to spekyng of assaylyng 
by buldynges ischift to þe walles of castel oþer of citee 
þat is byseged. 
And suche buldynges mowe be reducte 
to foure manere buldynges þat ben icleped aries, vinia, turris, musculus. 
Þe buldyng þat hatte aries, 
a weþer, 
is imaad of tree 
and iheled wiþ rawe hides and skynnes 
for to kepe it 
fro brennynge of fure. 
Vnder þis closet so iheled wiþ hides 
and strongliche imaad 
and iheled 
þat it be not ibroke wiþ stones 
wiþinne is a beem; 
in þe heed of þat beem 
is iclosed in yre, 
and is icleped a weþer, 
for by cause of þat yre it haþ most 
st[r]ong heed for to smyte. 
And þat beem is ibounde wiþ roopes oþer with chaynes 
to þat closet imaad of tree, 
and wiþdraweþ hym as it were a weþer and smyteþ þanne strongliche þe walles of þe strengþe 
þat is byseged and brekeþ hem. 
And ofte þe walle is ismete 
wiþ þat beem 
wiþ þe iren heede so 
þat þe stoones of þe wal 
bygennen to waggy and to falle. 
And in þe heed of þis beem 
is ipiƷt a crooke of yren | 
ischape as an hook, 
and þerwiþ þe stones 
þat ben loose ben idrawe 
vp out of þe wal 
for to make þe sonnere 
an hoole þrow þe wal. 
And suche buldyng is good to assaille a strengþe þeyƷ men mowe not come 
to þe walles þerof. 
For suche a beem wiþ 
an iren heed is wiþdrawe 
and ischift forþ 
and may smyte þe walles 
of þe strengþe 
þat is byseged, 
þey þe closet 
and þe helynge mowe not come 
to þe walles 
in þe whiche closet þe men ben þat wiþdrawen 
and scheuen forþ þe beem. 
And þis closet vnder þe whiche þe men 
ben þat drawen and scheuen þe weþer 
and þe beem 
mot be wel istrengþed 
lest þe men 
þat ben þer vnder be igreued 
in eny side wiþ arwes oþer wiþ stoones oþer in som oþer wise. 
Þe oþer buldyng 
to assaille and take strengþes 
þat ben byseged is icleped vinea; 
and som men clepeþ it cautum, 
and is imaad in þis wise. 
Grete planckes and stronge ben stronliche ibounde and ilased togeders 
and ben idoubled 
and imaad double planckes 
lest stoones 
þat ben iþrowe breke þis buldynge. 
Also it is iheeled 
wiþ rawe hides 
lest it be agreued wiþ fuyre. 
And me vseþ to make suche buldynge 
eigte foot brood and sextene foot long 
and so [h]ey þat [men] 
mowe wel be þerinne. 
And suche a buldyng so moche oþer more mot be wel istrengþed 
in eche side 
and ischeft to þe walles 
of þe strengþe 
þat is byseged; 
and men þat ben þer vnder scholde delue and vndermyne þe walles. 
And þis buldyng is good 
whanne þe strengþe 
[þat] is byseged stondeþ 
so þat suche a buldynge 
may be schift to þe walles. 
Þe þridde manere buldyng 
is icleped tour and castel. 
For | Ʒif þe strenþe 
þat is byseged 
may not be take 
by weþeres noþer by buldyng 
þat hatte vinea, 
þe mesure of þe walles of 
þat strengþe schal be take and toures 
oþer castels of tree schal be maad by þat mesure oþer heygere, 
þe whiche toures schal be heeled 
wiþ rawe huydes 
lest þei be sette afuyre. 
And wiþ suche toures of tree strengþes 
þat ben byseged ben assailled in twey manere wise. First, þrowyng stones. 
For Ʒif þe heyöþe 
of suche castels and toures passen heighþe of þe walles 
and of þe toures 
and bataillynge þerof, 
þei þat ben in suche castels and toures ben aboue hem 
þat ben in þe strengþe 
as þei þat ben in þe strengþe ben aboue hem 
þat ben in þe grounde. 
Also in suche castels and toures ben fallyng brygges 
on þe whiche brygges men goþ 
to þe walles of þe strengþe 
þat is byseged. 
And þe heiþe of walles may be take 
in twey maner wise. First, by schadwe. 
For a liƷt þrede scholde be 
certey[n]liche imete and iknyt to an arwe 
and ischote 
to þe walles of þe strengþe; 
and by þe ‡ quantite [þer]of, 
þe quantite of þe schadwe schal be take. 
And whan þe quantite of þe schadwe schal be take, 
a tree schal be rered 
vp riƷt þat makeþ 
so moche schadwe; 
by þe lenþe of þat tree þe heyghþe of þe walles is iknowe. 
Natheles for þe sonne schineþ 
not wel alwey noþer makeþ alwey schadwe 
but is som tyme iheled with cloudes, 
we schal teche oþer maner of takynge of heiƷþe 
of alle buldynges 
and of alle walles. 
Take a tree oþer a boord of þe lengþe 
of a certeyn man 
and þat man schal ligge adoun 
in þe grounde. 
And þe forseide | bord schal be sette 
at his feet 
and he schal loke ouer þe bord. 
And Ʒif his siƷt passeþ 
more heiƷ þan þe wal of þe whiche þe heiƷthe schal be take, 
þan þe man schal ligge neer to þe wal 
and þe boord at his feet. 
And Ʒif his siƷt passeþ 
more lowe wiþ þe borde at his feet, 
þanne he þat lith so 
in þe grounde schal lye ferþere 
fro þe wal wiþ þe boord at his feet. 
And so he schal lye ferþer oþer neer forto he may see euene þe toppe of þe wal ouer þe borde. 
For as it may be preued by gemetrie as moche as is þe space to þe walle 
fro þe heed of þat man 
þat lyeþ in þat wise, 
so moche is þe heiƷþe of þe wal. 
Also mesure of heyƷþe may be take by rewles 
þat ben itauƷt in astrolabye 
and in quadrante. 
But þerof charge we not, 
but a<t> þis tyme 
it is inow to speke of suche þynges 
as moche as sufftseþ to þe purpos. 
Þe ferþe manere buldyng 
is icleped musculus. 
And musculus is a litel buldyng 
vnder þe whiche men ben iheled 
þat drawen oþer scheuen casteles and toures 
to þe strengþe 
þat is byseged. 
Whanne it is imaad, 
þe strengþe may be assaylled 
in þre manere wise. 
For in a castel so imaad ben þre partees. Þe ouemeste partie passeþ þe walles and toures of þe strengþe 
þat schal be take; 
in þe myddel partie haþ brigges 
and letteþ hem falle on þe walle; 
and þe neþemeste partye ordeyneþ gynes 
þat ben icleped musculy 
vnder þe wyche musculus 
ben men þat drawen 
and scheueþ þe castel. 
And whanne þat castel 
is as nyƷ as it nedeþ to þe walles 
of þe strengþe 
þat is bysyged, 
þey þat ben in þe ouemeste partie schal þrowe stones | 
and dryue hem awey þat ben on þe walles. 
And þei þat ben in þe myddel partye schal lete falle brugges and assaile þe walles. 
But þei þat ben in þe lowest partye 
and vnder þe musculus schal Ʒif þei mowe come to þe walles, 
vndermyne hem so 
þat þei þat ben of þe sege mowe 
also in þat wise come 
in to þe 
streng[þ]e þat is byseged. 
Also þer scholde be arblasters, bowes, gynes to þrowe stones, 
and oþere suche so 
þat he smyte þe strenþe 
whan þe forseide doynge schal ben do. 
For in þe moo manere wise 
a strengþe is asayled at ones, 
þe more þei þat ben byseged 
ben afrayed 
and þe sonnere itake. Chapter XX 
After þat we hauen ispoken of bataille of feld and treteþ of bataille of sege teching hem 
þat bysegen strengþes and castels 
how þei scholde bysege and assaille hem, 
in þis partie we wol trete of bataille of defence; 
so þat after þat we hauen itauƷt hem 
þat bysegen 
how þei scholde assaille hem 
þat ben byseged, 
we wolle teche hem 
þat ben byseged 
how þei scholde defende hemself of hem 
þat bysegen. 
And þe first þat most makeþ 
þat a cite þat is byseged 
may be defended 
fro enemyes þat bysegen and makeþ most 
þat þei þat ben bysegede mowe wel defende here strengþe, 
it is knowynge how castels and citees and strengþes 
and oþere suche schulde be bulde 
þat þei be not esy to assaylle. 
And in suche buldynge 
fyue mote be knowe 
by þe whiche strenþes 
ben þe more stronge 
and worse for to be take. 
And first strengþes ben istrengþed 
and ben þe worse for to take 
by kynde of place, 
þe seconde | by comerd walles, 
þe þridde by erþed walles, 
þe ferþe by toures and pynacles, 
þe fifte by diches. 
By kynde of place citees and strengþes 
by þe more strong 
Ʒif þei ben ibuld in straiƷt place 
oþer in hiƷe 
þat ben euel to come to, 
as Ʒif þei ben iclepped aboute 
wiþ þe see, 
wiþ mareys, 
oþer wiþ reuers. 
And at bygynnyng whanne strengþe scholde be buld 
to be defended 
fro outward fiƷtyng 
and fro seges, 
þe kynde of þe place 
scholde be knowe so 
þat he be buld 
in suche a place 
þat he be þe more strong for þat place. 
þer Ʒif me may not a while 
to bulde newe strengþes, 
oþer som dredyng 
wrathe of lordes 
oþer lordes dredyng woodnesse of þe puple wol be defended in som strengþe, 
Ʒif þei mow come þerto, 
þei schoide haue suche a strengþe 
þat is by kynde of þe place 
þe more strong 
andþe hardere to take. 
Þe seconde, citees and strengþes 
ben þe hardere to assaille by cornered walles. 
For Ʒif þe walles 
of a strengþe be cornerede, 
Ʒif þe enemyes comen to þe walles 
for to assaille þe strengþe, 
þei þat ben byseged mowe þe better deffende hemself 
and þe sonnere greue þe enemyes. 
For by cause of þe comered walles 
þei mow smyte þe enemyes 
not onliche tofore but also as it were byhynde 
þei mowe smyte þe enemyes 
þat assayllen þe strengþe. 
Þerfore þe walles 
scholde be comered for þe strengþe myƷte be þe bettre defended. 
Þe þridde þat makeþ 
a strengþe þe worse 
to be assayled 
and itake is erþene walles. 
For in buldynge of a strengþe not | 
onlich nedeþ good place 
and comerd walles 
bote also aboute þat strengþe scholde be maad twey walles, 
innere and vttere som dele atwynne. 
And in þe space betwene þe tweyn walles 
scholde erþe be do 
þat is idigged 
out of þe diche, 
oþer þer scholde be do erþe ibrouƷt out of anoþer place. 
And of þat erþe me scholde make morter wel itempred 
þat it be as it were a wal. 
For toures mowe be maad 
of erþene mortere wel itempred, 
þerfore it is not inconuenient 
to make suche walles 
of erþene mortere wel itempred. 
And suche wallis ben goode 
for defautes of þe strengþe 
þat it be not ouercome 
with gynnes þat þrow stones. 
For þei al þe otter wal were ibete doun 
with suche gynes, 
Ʒut þe Ʒerþene wal scholde fonge þe strokes of þe gynes. 
For whanne a stoon 
is iþrowe wiþ suche a gyne þat comeþ 
to suche a wal, 
for neschenesse þerof þe erþe wol dyue 
yn and fonge þat stoon 
as þei it were 
ischape þerfore. 
For it is assayed 
þat erþene walles 
ben lasse igreued with gynes 
þat þrowen stones 
þan oþere walles, 
and suche an erþene wal scholde be þykke, 
for þanne withoute apayryng 
it may fonge stoones 
þat comen out of suche gynes. 
Þe ferþe þat maken strengþe 
þe more strong ben toures and pynacles. 
For on þe walles scholde be toures and pynacles 
þat þe strengþe myƷt be þe bettere defended. 
And nameliche tofore eche Ʒeat of þe strengþe of þe whiche is drede of brennyng by enemyes 
scholde be toures and pynacles. 
And tofore eche suche Ʒeat scholde be sette a cloos poortcoleys 
iheled wiþ ire al aboute and 
hongyn|ge by yrene rynges 
to lette þe comyng inne of þe enemyes 
and brennyng of fuyre. 
For þeiƷ men þat bysegen wolde sette þe Ʒeate of þe strengþe afuyre, 
þe portecoles þat is tofore þe Ʒeat scholde lette hem. 
Also aboue þe portecoleys scholde [be] 
a clif oþer 
an open place 
in þe wal to ward þe pourtcoleys, 
by þe whiche place men mow þrowe out stoones and water to quenche fuyre Ʒif men 
þat bysegen fonden to sette þe Ʒeate afuyre. 
Þe fifte þat makeþ strengþes 
þe more strong 
and þe worse to come 
to is depnesse and drede of diches 
þat scholde be ful of water Ʒif it may be. 
In þes manere wise strengþes 
ben þe worse to come to and to be take. 
Þerfore þei þat wolle defende strengþes 
f[ro] hem þat bysegen hem scholde take hede 
at bygynnynge þat þey haue 
in þe strengþe alle þes oþere manye þerof 
for to defende þe strengþe þe bettere. Chapter XXI It is not inow to knowe 
how strengþes schulde be buld 
and what walles 
þei scholde haue 
and in what place 
þei scholde stonde 
[but it be iknowe] ‡ how þei scholde be maad stronge so 
þat he be not sone itake. 
[It is iseide tofore 
þer ben þre weies 
þat strengþes ben itake: 
by hunger, 
þurst and fiƷtynge. 
Þanne Ʒif in þese weies strengþes 
þat ben byseged be maad stronge, 
þerby mowe noon strengþes be itake.] 
10 
And for þei scholde not be itake by hunger, 
þre mote ben iknowe. Whete, otes and barlich, 
and oþer corn, 
and alle oþere manere vetaylles 
scholde be ibrouƷt in to þe strengþe 
ar it be byseged wiþ enemyes. 
And if þer is drede 
of a sege tofore Ʒaderyng of fruyt, 
suche com and vitailles 
scholde be brouƷt 
in to þe strengþe 
out of oþere places 
þat ben nyƷ leste þe strengþe faille for defaute of vitailles 
whan it is byseged. 
And al þat may | not be brouƷt 
to þe strengþe, 
and al þat is not nedful þeiƷ 
it were ibrouƷt to castel 
oþer citee þat is byseged, 
schold al be sette afuyre and ibrent leste þe enemyes come þerto and take profit 
þerof and bysege þe strengþe 
vpoun þe cost of þe same strengþe. 
And Ʒif þer is drede 
þat þe sege schal dure longe tyme, 
þe citee oþer castel 
scholde be moste istored of myle. 
For among graynes myle rotyeth leest and dureþ most. 
And he scholde haue 
also good stoor of salt flesch; 
and also moche salt is nedful 
to a strengþe 
þat is byseged, 
for salt helpeþ to manye thinges. 
[Þe seconde,] 
in strengþyng of castel 
oþer of citee 
þat schal be byseged 
touchynge vitailles, 
it is not onliche to doynge to brynge to þe citee 
þat schal be byseged 
greet stoor of vitailles 
but also þe vitailles 
þat ben ibrouƷt mote be rediliche ikepte and delyuered by wise men and redye 
þat ben not wastours. 
Ʒif it may be Ʒif 
a greet citee is byseged 
and may not haue vitaylles 
out of oþere contrees, 
in eche contree þat longeþ 
to þat citee vitailes 
scholde be brouƷt 
to þe comyn bemes 
and be scarseliche and wiseliche ispended and deliuered by wise men and redye. 
And Ʒif a litel strengþe is byseged, 
it is not hurt for to do so for greet stoor and puruyance of vitaylles 
is as it were not worþ 
but it be scarseliche and wiseliche ispend. 
Þe þridde, 
in such doynge it 
nedeþ to knowe [þat] þe feble persones 
þat ben not profitable noþer <mowe> helpe to defende þe strengþe 
þat is byseged, 
Ʒif it may be, 
scholde be sende in to oþere contreis; 
for suche persones eten and wasteþ vetailles 
þat fiƷtynge men scholde haue. 
Also Ʒif þer is drede of defaute of vetaills, 
| beestes þat ben in þe strengþe 
þat is byseged, 
Ʒif þei þat ben byseged 
mowe wel spare hem, 
scholde be islayne and iselt Ʒif 
þei ben good to mete. 
And in suche a caas manye þynges ben iƷete þat ben comynliche forsake. 
For it is iknowe how a strengþe 
þat is byseged scholde do to kepe 
þat he be not itake by hunger, 
it may be sone iknowe how byseged men scholde do to kepe 
þat þei be not itake by þrist. 
For ar þei be byseged, 
þey scholde be avised 
and go to a st[r]engþe 
in þe whiche is water inow. 
And 3¿f þei ben in a strengþe 
in þe whiche is no welle, 
þei scholde make pittes. 
And 3¿f þe place is so drye 
þat þerinne may be no water, 
puttes scholde make cisternes 
to fonge and kepe reyn water 
so þat þe water of heuene 
may socoure and helpe in defaute of oþer water. 
And Ʒif þe strengþe 
þat is byseged 
is nyƷ þe see 
and may haue no water 
but salt water, 
for here fresch water 
is so feer 
þat þei mowe not come þerto for men of þe sege, 
þanne wiþ wax þei mowe of salt water 
haue fresch water. 
For as þe philosofer seith [in] Metheor[is], 
al þe salt water 
þat woseþ þrow wax bycomeþ fresch water. 
Also to þe strengþe 
þat schal be byseged scholde be brouƷt moche venegre 
and wyne leste by drynkynge of oonliche water 
fiƷtynge men ben so feble 
þat þei mowe not myƷtiliche wiþstonde þe enemyes and men of þe sege. 
For it is itreted 
what ben þe remedyes aƷenst hunger and þurst 
by þe whiche ofte strengþes ben itake, 
it is to tretyng of remedies 
lest a strengþe 
þat is byseged be take 
by fiƷtynge 
and by assaillynge and sautes. 
Þanne þei scholde brynge | 
to þe castel 
oþer citee moche brymstoon, pyche, and oylle to brenne engynes and gynnes of þe enemyes. 
Also moche yre and manye treen scholde be broƷt to þe strengþe 
þat is byseged for to make of þe treen schaftes, arwes, dartes, 
and buldyng 
þat nedeþ to þe strengþe. 
Also with ire armere 
may ben ame[n]ded and schaftes and arwes 
may be maad 
and oþere þynges 
þat nedeþ to assaille hem 
þat bysegen þe strengþe. 
Also moche yre is nedful to hem 
þat ben byseged for to destroye here 
gynes and buldynges 
þat bysegen hem, 
as it schal be declared in þe nexte chapitre. 
Also manye momele stones, 
þat is round stones of reuer‡s, 
scholde be ibrouƷt to þe strengþe, 
for suche stones ben most hard and sadde 
and best to þrowe and walles and towres 
scholde be ful of suche stones. 
Also moche lyme imaad to poudre scholde be ibrouƷt to þe strengþe 
and manye brotel vessels 
sch‡olde be ful þerof so 
þat whanne men of þe sege comeþ 
to þe walles of þe strengþe, 
suche vessels scholde be þrowe out among hem. 
And whanne þe vessels ben ibroke, 
þe lyme goþ inne to here eƷen and blyndeþ hem so 
þat þei mowe be bete as it were blynde men. 
Also manye senewes and ropes and cordes ben good in strengþes 
þat ben byseged for to araye albasters and bowes 
and oþere þynges 
þat neden to be arayed. 
And Ʒif senewes lakken, 
in here stede hors here 
oþer wymmen heer may helpe. 
For Vigesius seith þat whanne þe Romayns 
lackede senewes 
and myƷte not araye gynnes 
to wiþstonde here enemyes, 
wyues of Rome schare of here heere 
and Ʒaf it to here hous|ebondes. 
And whanne gynnes were arayed þerwiþ, 
þe Romayns put of þe rees of here enemyes. 
For as Vigesius seith þat þulke chaste [w]yues were leuere to lyue wiþ here housebondes 
wiþ vnsemelich heedes 
þanne serue enemyes 
wiþ hool heer and tresses. 
Also to strengþes scholde be ibrouƷt hornes of bestes 
to araye and amende arblastes and bowes 
and rawe huydes and skynnes to helye gynnes 
and oþere buldynges 
þat enemyes sette hem not afuyre. 
By þes cautels 
and by oþere 
þat ben iseid, 
men þat ben byseged mowe wiþstonde hem 
þat bysegeþ 
þat here strengþe be not itake by fiƷtynge. Chapter XXII 
Tofore ben irekened 
þre special maneres of assaylyng of strengþes 
þat ben byseged by mynes and weyes vnder erþe, 
by gynnes þat þrowen stones, 
and þe þridde, 
by buldynges ischift 
to þe walles of castel 
oþer of citee 
þat is byseged. 
Wherfore Ʒif we hauen itauƷt hem 
þat bysegen to assaille hem 
þat ben byseged 
in þe forsaide manere wise, 
it is to doynge 
þat we declare 
in what maner wise þei 
þat ben byseged 
mowe defende hem aƷenst hem 
þat bysegen 
in þe forseide manere 
of assaylynge and sautes. 
And first we schal telle and speke of remedies 
aƷenste assayllynge in mynes. 
And touchyng þat maner doynge 
we may assigne twey remedies. Oon is depnesse of diches ful of water. 
For Ʒif þe diches aboute a strengþe 
þat is byseged 
ben depe and ful of water, 
þei þat bysegen ben ilett 
þat þei mowe not by mynes and weyes vnder erþe assaile hem 
þat ben byseged. 
Nathalees þeiƷ þe | diches mowe not be ful of water, 
Ʒif þei ben ful depe and ful broode, 
þey letten atte fulle mynes 
and weyes vnder grounde. 
For strengþes þat ben byseged mowe not be assailled 
by mynes 
and weyes vnder grounde 
but þe mynes 
and weyes ben deppere 
þan þe diche. 
Þanne [oþer] a strengþe þat schal be defended stondeþ on hard stoon, 
[and] he may not 
þanne be itake by mynynge 
for hardnesse of þe stoon; 
oþer it stondeþ on brotel stoon 
oþer on grounde 
þat may wel be digged and idolue, 
and þanne þe strengþe scholde be maad 
þe more strong be depe diches 
lest it be itake by mynynge. 
Þe seconde remedye aƷenst mynes 
and weyes vnder erþe 
is to make in þe strengþe 
þat is byseged som wey aƷenst þe wey vnder erþe 
þat þei maken 
þat bysegen þe strengþe. 
And Ʒif þe strengþe 
þat is byseged haþ not depe diches noþer ful of water and dreden þerfore asaylynge by mynynge, 
þan þei þat ben byseged scholde besiliche take heede 
Ʒif he seeþ 
eny erþe ibere toward eny side 
and Ʒif þei mowe knowe by eny tokenes oþer signes 
þat þei þat ‡ bisegetþ] 
bygynneþ to myne. 
And Ʒif þei knowe 
þat þei mynen, 
anoon þei scholde make anoþer wey vnder erþe metyng wiþ þe myne; 
nathalees in þat wise 
þat þilke wey be hongynge aƷenste hem 
þat ben in þe myne. 
And þanne in þe metynge 
of þilke weyes, 
of þe whiche he 
þat bysegeþ make oon and he þat [ben] 
bysegede makeþ þe oþere, 
scholde be continual bataille 
and fiƷtynge lest þei þat ‡ 
bysege[þ] come 
þat wey in to þe strengþe. 
Also þei þat <beþ> 
bysegede scholde haue by þe | 
bygynnynge of here 
wey vnder erþe grete vates ful of water and of pisse. 
Whan þey fiƷten wiþ hem 
þat ben of þe sege, 
þey scholde feyne to flee and goo out of þe diche and scholde [schede] 
al þe forsaide water and pisse 
þat is so igadered vpon hem 
þat ben in þe myne. 
For in oure tyme manye men of seges were ispyld in þat wise; 
wherfore Ʒif it was som tyme ido, 
we scholde not holde inposcible Ʒif it is eft ido. 
For it is iknowe how assayllynge be mynynge scholde be wiþstonde, 
it is to wetynge how þey þat ben byseged scholde wiþstonde asaylyng 
by gynnes 
þat þroweþ stones. 
And aƷenste suche assaillyng 
is help in foure manere wyse. First, 
for som tyme manye men iarmed gon sodenliche out of þe strengþe 
þat is byseged and reseþ 
sodeynliche on þe gyne and setteþ it 
afuyre ar þe oost mowe defende it. 
But Ʒif þei þat ben byseged dar not go out of þe strengþe, 
þanne priueyliche by nygte somme ben ilette out by ropes 
ouer þe walles and bereþ 
wiþ hem fuyre preueyliche 
vnwetynge þe enemyes 
and setteþ 
þe engyne afuyre and ben idrawe 
vp in to þe strengþe agen by ropes 
whan þat is ido. 
Þe þridde manere 
to destroye gynnes 
is for to make arewes 
þat som men clepeþ colos. 
And suche an arwe haþ 
in þe myddel a certeyne holwenesse 
in þe whiche is ido strong fuyre, 
imaad of oyle, brymstoun, pych, and roseyne, 
iwrappede in herdene. 
Worryours in olde tyme clepede it incendiarium; and suche an arwe ischote wiþ 
a strong arblaster to | 
þe gyne ofte setteþ it afuyre. 
Þe ferþe manere to wiþstonde gynes þat þroweþ stones 
is for to make gynes wiþinne 
þe strengþe for to smyte hem and destroye hem. 
And among oþere þe beste remedye 
is after þat a gyne is imaad wiþinne, 
to make þerto a slenge of smale chaynes of yre oþer iheled wiþ ire. 
And bysydes þe gynne make a buldyng 
in þe whiche a greet ire al furye hoot schal be fuyred al afuyre hoot 
[and] schal be sette on þe slenge þat is iheled wiþ ire and iþrowe to þe oþere gyne oþer to eche manere buldynge of tree. 
And heeraƷenst rawe huydes helpeþ not and tymber may not wiþstonde, 
and al buldyng of tre 
may be brent in þis wise. 
And þer ben manye oþere particulers cautels 
þat helpeþ aƷenst gynes 
þat þrowen stones. 
But for suche mow not alle be irekened, 
þei mot be left 
to avisement of wise men and redye. 
For it is iknowe 
how me schulde withstonde mynes 
and gynes 
þat þrowen stones, 
it is to declarynge 
how me scholde withstonde 
oþere buldynges 
þat ben ischift to þe walles of a strengþe 
þat is byseged. 
And herto helpeþ 
alle þat we speke of touchynge 
wiþstondynge of gynes. 
For as gynes þat þrowen stones 
mowe be destroyed 
by a sodeyne rees of hem 
þat ben byseged 
vnwetyng þe enemyes, 
and by men isent out of þe strengþe 
preueyliche by nyƷte, 
and by arewes þat bere strong fuyre, 
and by gynes þat þrowen stones, 
and by slenges iheled wiþ ire 
þat þrowen fuyre hoot ire, 
so in al þis wise buldynge of tree | 
may be assayled. 
And it is assaied 
þat aƷenste 
al suche buldynges it helpeþ‡ most Ʒif fuyre or ire is iþrowe þeron wiþ oþere gynnes oþer 
in som oþer wise. 
Nathales aƷenst suche buldynges 
we may asigne certeyn remedyes, 
as aƷenst þe weþer we may asigne þe wolf. 
For it was iseid tofore 
þat þe beem wiþ þe heed iheled wiþ 
ire smytynge þe walles of a strengþe 
þat is byseged is icleped a weþer 
for þe heed is so hard. 
ÞeraƷen scholde be ordeyned a croked ire wiþ strong teeþ and scharpe ibounde wiþ ropes wiþ þe whiche þe heed 
of þe weþer 
is itake oþer þe heed of þe beem þat is so iheled wiþ ire. 
And whanne þe heed is so itake, 
oþer it is idrawe al vp in to þe strengþe oþer it is so suspended 
þat it may greue not þe walles. 
And so olde werriours clepede þat ire a wolf, 
for þey taken so 
þe weþer wiþ scharpe teeþ. 
And aƷenst toures and castels furye 
ire helpeþ moche. 
Naþales þer is a special remedye þeraƷen, 
for þer ben imaad preueyliche weyes 
vnder erþe 
and þe erþe 
is vndermyned 
where þe castel scholde passe. 
And whanne þe erþe 
is so vndermyned 
and þe castel afalle in to þe diche þat is vnder grounde 
and slilich iheled, 
for þe castel is so heuy it mot be maad aƷe, 
for it may not be brouƷt hool out of þe diche. 
And aƷenst þe buldynges 
þat ben icleped vinea and musculus fuyre hoot ire helpeþ moche. 
Nathalees Ʒif it happeþ 
þat suche buldynges perischeþ 
þe wal of þe strengþe 
þat is byseged, 
Ʒif doute is þerof, 
ar it be do, 
by þe wal scholde be maad bul|dyng of tree 
oþer stoon wal 
(Ʒif it may be) 
so þat Ʒif enemyes comeþ 
in to þe strengþe, 
þer he schal be holde iclosed bytweyne þilke walles, 
not myƷty to defende hemself 
for closynge of þe walles 
and so þey mowe be bete wiþ stones and aleyd. 
But it is besiliche to takyng hede 
þat som tyme men 
of þe sege feyneþ 
to fle and takeþ 
so þe strengþe 
by fraude and by gyle. 
Þerfore strengþe scholde not be [leflt necligentliche wiþoute kepynge anone 
after þat enemyes agoo. 
But þe strengþe of þe enemyes scholde be besyliche icharged 
so þat þei gete not by fraude and by gyle 
þat þei myƷte not gete wiþ myƷt and wiþ strengþe. Chapter XXIII 
In þis laste chapitre we wol trete 
som what of bataille of schippes; 
but it nedeþ not to abyde longe þere aboute, 
for manye þynges 
þat ben iseid of oþere manere batailles 
mowe helpe in batailles in schippes. 
And touchynge þat manere of fiƷtynge, 
first it is to wetynge 
how a schip scholde be maad. 
For Ʒif a schip is euel imaad, 
it is sone ilost 
by a litel asaillyng of enemyes. 
Þanne as Vigesius seith, 
it is to wetyng þat treen and tymber of þe 
whiche a schip scholde be maad scholde not be ifeld 
in eche tyme of þe gere. 
For in March and in Auerel 
whan moche hemour is in treen, 
it is not good to felle treen 
of þe whiche a schip scholde be maad. 
But in Iule and in Agust 
oþer in som oþer tyme 
whanne þe humour 
in treen is fordryed, 
it is good to felle treen of þe whiche a schip scholde be maad. 
Also a schip scholde not be made of treen anoon 
as þei ben ifeld, 
| but first treen scholde be isawed and imaad bordes þerof and abyde 
a certeyne tyme 
þat þei mowe drye and clynge. 
For Ʒif a schip is imaad of grene tymber, 
whanne þe kynde humour passeþ and failleþ, 
þe tymber schrynkeþ 
and makeþ in þe schip chynes and cliftes 
and no þyng [mowe be] 
more perilous þan þat. 
And it is hard to take hede 
at ones to batailles of schippes 
and to putte hemself 
to peril 
lest þe schippe be broke oþer sonk. 
For it is iknowe how schip tymber schulde be feld 
and be let abyde 
for to dryge and clynge 
for to make wel a schip þerof, 
it is to wetynge how in a schip so imaad a bataille scholde be geue. 
And touchynge som doynge a bataille of schippes haþ som manere doynge liche 
to manere doynge of bataille of þe feld. 
For as in bataille of þe feld it 
nedeþ 
þat fiƷtynge men be wel iarmed and cunne wel defende hemself 
fro strokes and geuen enemyes 
sore strokes and woundes, 
and so þis nedeþ 
in bataille of þe see. 
And also in suche fiƷtynge it 
nedede þat men be betere iarmed 
þan in fiƷtynge in londe. 
Þanne for men 
þat fiƷten in þe see stondeþ 
as it were ipigt and meuen but a lite þe[i] mowe þe better bere heuy armer, 
wherfore here armere scholde be þe more heuy. 
But as it longeþ to þis doynge, 
we may rekene ten by þe whiche see fiƷtynge men scholde assaylle here enemyes. 
Þe firste is fuyre 
þat is icleped incendiarius. 
For it scholde haue wiþ 
hem manye vesselles 
ful of pich, 
of brymston, 
of roseyn, of oyle; 
and alle þes scholde be wrapped wiþ herdene. 
And þese vesselles | 
so ful scholde be isette afuyre 
and iþrowe in to þe schippe of enemyes. 
And þe vessel breke 
and sette afuyre þe mater of þe brennynge and setteþ þe schip afuyre. 
And manye suche scholde be þrowe in to þe schip for to sette þe schip 
afuyre in manye places. 
And whanne suche thingges ben iþrowe, 
it is to doynge for to fiƷte harde and sore wiþ þe schip men so 
þat þei mowe not a while quenche þe fuyre. 
Þe seconde, 
buschements helpeþ moche in batailles of þe see. 
For as in þe lond 
ben isette boschementes of knygtes 
þat fallen and resen on enemyes 
vnwaar and affrayen hem 
and ouercomen hem sone, 
so in þe see byhynde 
som ilondes ben imaad boschementes so þat þe fiƷtynge men breken out and fallen on enemyes 
vnwaar and ouercome hem þe sonnere. 
Þe þridde, 
in bataille of þe see it is to doynge 
þat þey þat sayllen haue alwey here schip 
in deep water and dryue þe schip of enemyes 
to þe clyfward; 
for þey þat ben idrawe 
to lond lesen þe rees of asayllynge. 
Þe ferþe, 
to þe mast of þe schip 
scholde be honged a long tree 
iheled wiþ ire in eyþer ende 
for to smyte bothe schip and schip men, 
as þe instrument 
þat hatte þe wether smyteþ þe walles of a cyte 
þat is byseged. 
And þat tre scholde be ordeyned 
in þis wise so þat þe bond 
þat holdeþ 
it may be meued vpward and dounward, 
and so is þe more avantage 
for to smyte 
þerwiþ 
boþe þe schippe and men 
þat ben þerinne. 
Þe fifte, 
in bataille of schippes 
scholde be many brood arwes 
for to kerue þe sailles 
of enemyes and make | 
þerinne many greet holes and slettes. 
For whanne in þe sailles 
ben many holes and slittes 
and mowe not holde wynd, 
þan þe enemyes mowe not holde ful cours 
for to smyte noþer mow s[o]ne flee Ʒif þey wol wiþdrawe 
out of þe bataille. 
Þe sixte, 
schip men vse to haue 
a croked ire 
as it were 
an hook ful scharp and keruyng and kerueþ 
þerwiþ anoon ropes 
þat holdeþ þe sailles. 
And whan þe sayles 
ben so iket 
and þe maste ben ifalle, 
me wiþdrawen 
fro þe enemyes so 
þat þei mowe not fiƷte. 
For by suche kyttynge of saylles and of ropes þe schip 
is þe more slow 
and þe lasse myƷty to fiƷte. 
Þe seuenþe, 
schip men vsen to haue strong 
yren crokes 
þat þei mowe, 
whanne þey ben among enemyes, 
wiþ þilke crokes take here schippes 
þat þei mowe not passe 
awey þeiƷ þei wolde. 
Þe eiƷte, 
in bataille of schippes 
þis cautel scholde be knowe, 
þat þei scholde haue manye vessels 
ful of whiƷt lyme oþer of chalk 
þat schold be þrowe 
fro hiyƷ place 
in to schippes of enemyes. 
And whanne þei ben stronglich iþrowe and ibroke, 
pouder ariseþ, 
as we seide tofore 
in bataille in londe, 
and comeþ in to þe eyƷen of enemyes 
and greueþ hem so þat þei ben 
as it were iblynded 
and mowe not see. 
And þat is ful perelous in bataille of schippes, 
for in suche a bataille fiƷtyng men 
ben in peril of deeþ in eche side. 
Wherfore Ʒif eyen of fiƷtynge men 
in suche a bataille 
ben so igreued wiþ poudre of lyme oþer of chalke so 
þat þei mowe not isee, 
þei mowe ÜƷtliche be spilde of here enemyes 
oþer adreynt in þe see. 
Þe nynþe cautel 
is to haue manye vessels 
ful of nesche soope 
þat | scholde be strongliche iþrowe 
in to þe schippes of enemyes, 
and þat on þe place 
in þe whiche þe enemyes stonden inne to defende þe schippes. 
For whanne þilke vessels ben ibroke, 
þilke places ben imaad so slidere by nesche sopeþat whanne enemyes setten here feet 
þerinne anon þey fallen in to þe see. 
Þe tenþe is as it were worst of alle. 
For som schip men mowe dure longe vnder water, 
þanne schip men scholde ordeyne 
som what aƷenst þe schip of enemyes 
and sende oon byhynde pryueiliche 
þat may longe abyde vnder water 
and make hooles wiþ a gymelot oþer 
with an augeer in þe schip of enemyes 
in þe neþer side, 
and make manye hooles þerinne 
þat þe enemyes may not fynde. 
And whanne moche water comeþ 
in at þilke hooles, 
þe enemyes ben ilost and þe schip also. 
Also it is to wetyng 
þat in a bataille of schippes 
scholde be manye stoones 
and manye scharpe ires 
þat may be þrowe riƷt as stones 
wiþ þe whiche enemyes 
ben soone igreued. 
But þer ben so manye suche particuler doynges 
þat þei mowe not alle be irekened. 
Þanne ben þer cautels inowe 
þat we hauen itauƷt touchinge batailles of schippes. 
For it is declared how treen and tymber scholde be feld of þe whiche schippes scholde be maad and how me scholde fiƷte 
in batailles of schippes, 
it is to doynge 
þat we declare wherto 
alle batailles ben iordeyned. 
Þanne it is to wetyng, 
as þe philosofer meneþ, 
þat [we] werryeth 
not for to haue werre 
but for to haue pees. 
And bataille and werre may be ordeyned 
of malice of men, 
and by coueityse for | to haue wynnynge, 
oþer wreche for wrathe, 
oþer som likynge. 
But riƷtful batailles ben iordeyned 
for pees and quyete of men 
and for þe comune profit, 
for batailles scholde be among men 
as drenches and blood letynge 
in þe bodye of mankynde. For in þe bodye of man ben manye humours, 
so among men ben manye persones 
and manye men. 
And as while þe humours ben accordynge in þe bodye vs 
nedeþ noþer drenche 
ne bledyng 
while þer is no passyng of humours, 
so while men beren hem wel and non doþ 
oþer wrong 
scholde no werre be noþer bataille. 
Wherfore as by bledynge 
and by drenches 
superfluyte of humours 
is iþrowe out þe whiche superfluyte 
letteþ heele of þe body, 
so by batailles enemyes scholde be bore adoon and isleyne 
þat letten þe comune profit and pees of citeseynes and of hem þat ben in þe regne. 
Þanne Ʒif kynges and princes hauen riƷtful werre and bataille 
and Ʒif here enemyes 
disturblen wrongfulliche þe pees and þe comyn profit, 
it is not inconuenyent to teche hem al maner fiƷtynge of bataille 
and al maner doynge 
by þe whiche þei mow 
ouercome here enemyes. 
And al suche doynge þei scholde ordeyne 
for þe comyn profit 
and for pees of citeseyns. 
For Ʒif þei desiren þe comyn profit 
and pees of þe citeseyns, 
þei schulle haue þat perpetual pees 
in þe whiche is cheef quiete 
and reste – þe whiche pees God graunteþ and byhoteþ 
to his owne trewe seruantes 
þat is iblessed for eueremore. Amen.
