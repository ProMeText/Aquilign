Bot fals men make her fingres feld
& doþ hem wepe wel sore, to rewe
Her res:
Þurth wreches, þat er vntrewe,
Wimen ben holden les.

Chosen þai be to mannes fere,
O niȝt in armes for to wende:
ȝif ani man may it here
Of a schrewe, þat wil wimen schende,
Y speke for hem, & make hem skere,
& say, þat þai er gode & hende.
When þou art ded & leid on bere,
In to blis þi soule schal wende
& bide:
He was born of woman kinde,
For ous bare blody sin.

Derworþer drouri wot y non,
Þan woman is, & wise of rede.
Gold no siluer no riche ston
Is non so douhti in dede.
Þai make Willam, Roberd & Jon
In ioie & blis her liif to lede,
þat elles schuld spille, flesche & bon,
& ly & dwine hem selue to dede
Þurth pine:
Birddes, blisced mot ȝe be
For loue of o virgine.

Eiȝen gray & browes bent
Þat bere þis birddes briȝt on ble;
In eueri lond, þer þai be lent
Is ful of mirþe & jolifte.
It is a sond, þat God haþ sent,
In erþe to gladi man wiþ gle.
Were wimen out of lond ywent,
Al our blis were brouȝt on kne
Wel lawe:
Hou schuld men ani corn repe,
Þer no sede is souwe?
Feir & swete is wimannes viis,
Þe man, þat wil hem wele bihold,
White & rede so rose on riis,
Louely liþe her here yfold
Wiþ eiȝe, forheued & nose tretis,
Al beutes þai han in wold.
For loue of on, þat berþ þe priis, 
Y prais hem, boþe ȝong & old
Bidene:
Who so lackeþ hem in lore,
He wretþes heuen-quene.

Gentelri is a plaunt, as y ȝou telle,
In wiman it springeþ in ich a liȝþ,
Þai er meke & noþing felle,
Hende in halle as hauke in friȝþ.
He schal be curssed wiþ boke & belle,
Þai ani vilaini mengeþ hem wiþ,
To rest him in þe pine of helle,
Þer neuer more schal be no griþ
No bote.
Y wold rede no cursed wreche,
Oȝain our leuedi to mote.

Harpe no fiþel no sautri,
Noiþer wiþ eld no wiþ ȝong,
Is non so swete to sitten by
Al wiman, þer þai speke wiþ tong.
Her speche resteþ a man wel ney
Bitvene his liuer & his long,
Þat doþ his hert rise on hey,
So clot, þat liþ in clay yclong
So sore:
Who þat lackeþ wiman in lore,
Y rede, he do no more.

In al þis world was neuer no clerk,
Seþþen Adam was fourmed & Eue,
No man þat wered breche no serk,
Þat wimannes vertu couþe screue.
Þan were it to me ful derk,
A þing, þat schuld min hert greue,
For to ginne swiche a werk,
Þat neuer man no miȝt acheue
To þende:
Y take wittnes at our leuedi,
Þat wimen er gode & hende.

King & emperour & kniȝt,
Alle þai were of wiman bore,


& God was in a woman liȝt,
& elles were alle þis world forlore.
For it is a þing, þat bereþ riȝt
Atvix þe crop & þe more.
Amid þe tre þe frout was piȝt, 
Þat Jesu was don on rode fore,
To winne
Our soules out of helle,
Þat were bounden in sinne.
Liif is alle in woman laft
& chosen þai be for trister in tour.
Þennes þarf hem neuer be raft,
Þai may þer liue wiþ gret honour.
In a chaumber of louely craft
No þarf hem dout of no schour:
Oȝain al þing wiman schaft
Of alle londes þai bere þe flour
& priis,
As ouer alle oþer floures
Rose yrailed on riis.
Mari, þat bar God almiȝt,
Help now, ich haue nede,
For wimannes honour to fiȝt,
Hou þai er hende in ich a dede.
Of hem it springeþ day & niȝt
Swete morseles, þis lond to fede,
Frout þat is so michel o miȝt
Men y-armed stef on stede
& strong;
God ȝiue hem ioie & blis
& liif to last long!

Note of þe niȝtingale
Ysett at nouȝt in time of May,
No oþer foules gret & smale,
Þat sit & singen her lay,
Oȝaines a foule, þat sit in sale,
Wiþouten cage (ain) yclad in say:
Hir note abateþ mannes bale,
Þer nis no wiȝt, þat can say nay
Wiþ mouþe:
We auȝt for our leuedi loue
Honour wiman, ȝif we couþe.

Of al vertus wiman is rote;
Say noman nay, for it is so
Of al bales þai be bote,
To help a man of vncouþe wo;
þai beren salues, þat ben swote,
To hele me & oþer mo,
To make a man to lepe wiþ fot, 
Þat ere was sike & miȝt nouȝt go
No stonde.
Wiman is comfort to man,
To bring him out of bond.

Perlis priis & paruink
Is woman viis in eueri plas.
No may no clerk write wiþ ink
Þe swetnesse, þat þai han in face,
No in his hert him biþink,
Alle his wittes þei he chace,
Wimen, þer þai sit on benk,
Hou miȝti þai ere & ful of grace
Fulfilt;
For God for ous in a wiman
His bigging haþ ybilt.
Quen of heuen, ich am þi man,
In erþe to speke for þine ost;
Helpe me, leuedi, for y no can,
For to abate þe wreche bost,
Hem, þat schende gode wiman,
Þat ioie of hem in erþe is most.
Al our blis of wimen gan,
Swete leuedy, þou it wost,
Ywis,
For þou bar þat ich bern,
Þat brouȝt ous alle to blis.

Rose no no lili flour
No woderof þat springeþ on heþ,
Is non so swete in his odour,
For soþe, so is wimannes breþ.
Piment, clare no no licour,
Milke, perre no no meþ;
& who so loued hem wiþ honour,
No dye he neuer schamely deþ
Þurth gilt!
God lat neuer her soules
For non sinnes be spilt!

Spice wiþ schip, is time of pes
Þat com sailand out of þe souþe,
Rapeli raikand on a res
Ouer þe se, þat ebbeþ & flouþ,
Is non so swete in his reles,
So is a cosse of womannes mouþe;
For priis of spices ichir ches, 
Most of vertu & namcouþe.
For why?
It is euer aliche newe
Boþe lat & arly.

Trewe as treacle er þai to fond,
Clere of colour, so is þe wine;
Þai ben birddes of Godes sond,
Loueliche to leggen vnder line.
Mani & fele þer ben in lond;
For soþe y say, þat on is min;
Where so þat y wake or stonde,
Ywis, ichaue a mele fin
In hord,
Lufsum, fair & hende,
Trewe & trusti in word.

Bontable is womannes þouȝt,
It stikeþ þer þai han it sett.
Þei anoþer hir haþ bisouȝt,
Sche wil held þat sche haþ hett,
& say, for soþe, hem helpeþ nouȝt,
No schal hem neuer be þe bett;
Bot fals werkes, þat men han wrouȝt,
Maken oft her leres wet
Wel wete.
Þer a woman loue is sett,
Loþ hir is to lete.
Christ is king & God in tron:
Þay þat woman schende, ȝif hem schame!
Lord, þou graunt me mi bon,
Y schal grete þe wiþ game.
Þine heued, þi fete, þi bodi bidon;
Wel oft þai swere idel þi name:
Þou, þat made sonne & mone,
Swiche wreches, in erþe hem to tame
To schond,
For we auȝt for our leuedi loue
Wiman honour to fond.

Þei a schrewe on woman lyȝe,
Hir godenis is neuer þe las;
ȝete he may happen, ar he dye,
Þurth tvelue monþes for to pas,
Heiȝe on galwes his mete to fi,
& vnder him grese boþe ox & asse,
& as a dogge in feld to ly, 
Wolues & houndes to don his masse
Bi niȝt;
For we auȝt for our leuedi loue
Hold wiman to riȝt.

Zabulon is a land of lede,

Nouȝt al þe minstrels, þat ben kidde,

Wiþ harpe no fiþel, sautri þer midde,
Orgens þat er ioined wiþ ginne,
No miȝt nouȝt telle half þe gode,
Þat a gode woman is wiþ inne,

Who þat seit wiman schame,
Ywis, he is vnkende.
