HIC INCIPIT PROLOGUS ISTIUS LIBRI. 
[Here begins the Prologue of this book.] 
For as moche as the lond over the see, 
that is to say the Holy Lond 
that men calleth the lond of Bethtony, 
amonge alle londes hit 
is most worthi and sovereyn of all other londes, 
and is y-blessed and y-halwed 
and sacred 
of the precious blode of Oure Lord Jhesu Crist. In the which londe hit liked Hym 
to take flessh and blood of the Virgyn Marie 
and to honoure that lond 
with His blessed foot. 
And ther He wolde do many miracles 
and preche and teche the feyth 
and the lawe of us Cristyn men 
as to His dere children. 
And ther He wolde suffre many repreves 
and skornes for us. 
And He that was kyng of Heven and of eorthe, 
of eyr and see, 
and of thynges 
that beth y-conteyned on hem, 
He wolde only be callid kyng 
of that lond 
whan He seith thus: 
Rex sum Judeorum. 
That is to say: 
"I am kyng of Jewes." 
For that tyme was [fol. 7r] 
that londe of Jewes. 
And that londe He had y-chose bifore all other londes 
as the most vertuous and most worthi of the world. 
And therfore seith the philosofre thus: 
virtus rerum in medio consistit. 
That is to say: 
"vertu of thynges 
is in the myddel." 
And in that londe He wolde lede His liff 
and suffre passion 
and deth of Jewes 
for to bigge us and de- livere us 
fro paynes of Hell 
and deth withouten eynde, 
which was ordeyned to us for synne 
of oure forme fader Adam 
and for oure owen synnes also. 
As for Hymself nought, 
for He hadde noon yvel deserved, 
for He dide never yll. 
And He that was kyng of joye, 
He myght best in that place suffre deth. 
For whoso wole do eny thyng 
for the which he wole be knowe opynli, 
he wole do hit crie opynli 
in the myddel place of a cité 
other of a toune, 
so that hit may be knowe 
to all parties of that cité 
other of that toune. 
So dide He 
that was kyng of the worlde. He wolde suffre deth at Jerusalem, 
that is in the middel of the worlde, 
so that hit myght be knowe to men 
of all parties of the worlde 
how dire He bought man 
that He made to His lick- nys 
for the gret love 
that He hadde to us. 
For more worthy catel 
myght nought be sette for us 
than His blessid body 
and His precious blood 
which He offred for us. 
Lo, dere God, 
what love He hadde to His sogettes, 
when He that hadde don no trespas, 
only for oure trespas suffred deth. Ryght wel ought men 
to love 
and drede and worshippe soche a lord, 
and preise soch a lond 
so holy 
that brought forth soch a fruyt, 
thorgh which every man is saved 
but hit be his owene defaute. 
This is the lond 
that longeth to oure heritage. 
And in that lond He wolde deyghe 
and seysed to leve hit to His children. 
For which every good Cristen man 
that hath wherof 
sholde streynth hem 
for to conquere oure ryght heritage 
and chace away the myssetrewantes. 
For we beth called Cristen men of Crist [fol. 7v] Oure Fader. 
And if we be right children of Crist 
we aughte then to chalenge the righte heritage of Oure Fader 
and put hit out of strange men hondes. 
But now pryde, covetise, and envye hath 
enflammed the herte of lordes of the worlde, 
that they bien more bisy forto deserte her neyghbores 
than to chalange 
and conquere here 
ryght heritage biforeseyd. 
And comyn peple 
that wolde put here body and catel 
to conquere oure heritage 
may nought do withoute lordes. 
For asemblé of comyn peple 
withoute a chief lorde beth 
as a flock of sheep 
that hath no shephurd, 
which they parteth asoundre and woot nought whyder to go. 
But wolde God 
that wordli lordis 
were of good acoord 
and eche of hem other 
and also comune peple 
that they wolde take this holy viage over the see. 
I trowe then withynne a litel 
while oure right heritage 
forsayde sholde be reconsiled 
and y-putte 
in handes 
of the right eyres of Jhesu Crist. 
And for as moch as men desireth 
to hyre speke of the Holy Lond 
and they have therof greet solas, spoort, and comfort, 
I shal telle somwhat 
that I have sey. 
John Maundevyle knyght, thow Y be nought worthi, 
that was bore in Engelond 
in the toun of Seynt Albones 
and passed the see 
in the yer of the Incarnacioun of Oure Lord Jhesu Crist 1332 
uppon Seynt Michelis day. 
And sithe hiderward 
have Y be long tyme over the see, 
and have Y seye and go thorgh many londes, 
and Y leygh in many provinces and kyngdomes. 
I have passed thorgh Turky and Surry, 
Hermony the Lasse and the More, Tartari, Perce, Arabie, Egipte the Heigh and the Lowe, Libie, Caldee, 
and a greet party of Ethiope, Amazayn, 
and a greet partye of Inde the More and the Lasse, 
and thorgh many other iles 
that beth aboute Inde, 
wher that dwelleth many diverse folk 
of maneris 
and diverse lawes and shappes. 
Of which londes and iles Y [fol. 8r] 
shal speke more plenerly. 
And Y shal divise a parti 
of that Y have seye in the worlde 
as hit may come 
to my mynde herafter. 
And speciali of hem 
that wole and beth in purpos 
to visite the holy cité of Jerusalem, 
and the holy places 
that beth thereaboute, 
and weyes which men shul holde thider, 
for Y have many tymes y-passid and ryden to Jerusalem 
in company of greet lordes 
and other good companye. 
EXPLICIT PROLOGUS DE MAUNDEVYLE. 
[Here ends Mandeville's Prologue.] 
A WAY TO JERUSALEM. [Chapter 1.] 
In the name of God Almyghty, 
whoso wole passe over the see, 
he may go by many waies 
after the contré 
that he cometh fro, 
and many of hem cometh 
to oon eynde. 
But troweth nought 
that Y wole telle all the tounes, citees, and castelles 
that men shul go by, 
for then sholde Y make a long tale, 
but sum contreis and most principal stedes 
that men shul go thorgh 
to the ryghte way. Ferst, if a man come fro the west side of the worlde 
as Ingelonde, Walys, Skot- lond, Irlond, Norway, 
he may if he wole go thorgh Almayne 
and the kyngdome of Hungré, 
that marcheth to the lond of Poyaline 
and to the lond of Panonye and Alfeigh. 
The kyng of Hungré is right 
a greet lorde 
and holdeth greet londes and fele, 
for he holdeth the lond of Hungré, Savoyze, Comayne, 
a greet party of Bulgarie 
that men calleth the lond of Bugers, 
and a greet party of the kyngdome of Rosse, 
and hit lastith 
to the lond of Neflond, 
and hit marcheth to Pruysse. 
And in the lond of Hungrie, 
men goon thorgh a cité 
that men calleth Chipproun 
and thorgh the castel of Newbow, 
by the same toun 
that is toward the eynde of Hungrie. 
And thenne men passeth 
by the ryver of Danubye, 
that is a greet ryver 
and hit goth to Almayne 
under the hilles of Lombardy, 
and hit taketh into hym 40 other ryvers 
and hit renneth 
thorgh Hungry, 
thorgh Grecis, 
thorgh Tarchie, 
and goth into the [fol. 8v] see so swiftly that the water is fressh 20 mile in the see. 
And then men goth to Belgrave 
and entre into the lond of Bruges 
and ther men passith a brugge of stoon 
that is over the rever of Marrok. 
And so passith thorgh the lond of Pynceras 
and cometh to Grece, 
to the cité of Sternes, 
and to the cité of Affynpayn, 
and so to the cité of Bradremple, 
and thenne to Constantynople, 
that was sumtyme called Bessamoran, 
and ther dwelleth comunely the emperour of Grece. 
Ther is the beste cherch of the worlde and fairest, 
and hit is of Seynt Sophie. 
And byfore this cherch 
is an image of Justinian 
the emperour y-gilded 
uppon an hors y-crouned. 
And hit was woned 
to holde an apple rounde in his hond. 
And men seyn ther 
that hit 
is a tockne 
that the emperour hath i-loste 
a greet party of his lond, 
for the appill is fall 
out 
of the imageis hond 
for he lost gret party of his lordship. 
For he was woned 
to be emperour of Romayne and Grece 
and all Asie the Lasse, 
of Syrrie, 
and of the lond of Jude, in the which is Jerusalem, 
and of the lond of Egipt, 
of Percie, and Arabie; 
but hit was lost — 
all but Grece. 
And men many tymes wolde putte the apple 
into the imageis hond, 
but he wolde nought holde hit. 
And his other hond 
he holt upward 
to the west 
in tockne to manasse mysdowers. 
This image stondeth 
uppon a pilour of marbell. 
At Constantynople ther 
is the sponge 
and the reed 
of the which the Jewes gaf Oure Lorde 
to drynke galle uppon the Croys. 
Som men lyveth that half of the Croys of Crist be in Cipre 
in an abbey of monkes, 
that men calleth the hille of the Holy Croys; 
but hit is nought so, 
for that crosse 
that is in Cipre 
is that crosse 
that uppon which Dismas, 
the good theef, was honged. 
But all men woot nought, 
and that is nought wel y-do, 
for they seyn for getyng of offryng [fol. 9r] 
that hit is the Croys of Our Lord Crist. 
And ye shal understonde 
that the Croys of Our Lord 
was i- makyd of foure maner of trees, 
and hit is conteyned in this verse: 
In cruce fit palma, cedrus, cipressus, oliva. 
For that pece 
that went upright 
fro the erthe 
into the heed was of cipresse; 
and that pece overthwart 
into the which the hondes wer nayled was of palme; 
and the mortais of cedre; 
and the table above his heed 
that was a foot and half long, 
uppon the which the title was 
wryten 
in Ebru, Greu, and Latyn, 
was of olive: 
Jhesu Nazarenus, rex Judeorum. 
And the Jewes makid this Cros 
of these foure maner of trees 
for they wened that Oure Lord 
sholde have honged 
uppon that Cros als longe 
as that Cros myght have dured. 
And therfore they maked the foot of cedre, 
for cedre may nought rote in erthe, 
nother in water. 
And for they wente 
that the body of Crist 
sholde have stonke, 
therfore was maked a peece 
that went 
fro the erthe 
upward of cipres: 
for that tre is wel smellyng, 
so that the stench of His body 
shold nought have greved men 
that passid therby. 
And that overthwart peece 
was maked of palme, 
for in the Olde Testament was ordeyned 
that when any man hadde victorye 
he was crouned with palme. 
And the table of the title was maked of olive, 
for that tree tokned pees, 
as the story of Noe witnessith hit, 
whan the culver brought the branch of olive 
that bitokneth pees 
y-maad 
bytwixt God and man. 
And so trowed the Jewes 
to have pees 
when Crist were deed, 
for they seide that Crist 
makid the bate among hem. 
And ye shal understonde 
that Our Lord was nayled 
to the Cros liggyng, 
and therfore He suffred the more payn. 
As Grekes and Cristin men 
that dwelleth over the see seyn, 
that the tre of the Cros 
that we callen cipresse 
was of the tree that Adam eet of the apple, 
and so fynde [fol. 9r] they writen. 
And they sayn that her scripture telleth 
that Adam was sike 
and bad his son Seth 
that he sholde go to Paradis 
and pray the angel 
that kepid Paradis 
that he wolde sende hym 
of the oyle of mercy 
to anoynty 
therwith his membris 
that he myght have heel. 
And Seth wente theder, 
but the angel wold nought lete hym in, 
but seyde to hym 
that he myght nought have the oyle of mercy. 
But tho he toke hym foure graynes 
of the same tre that Adam eet of the apple and bad hym als so sone 
as his fader were deed, 
he sholde put tho graynes 
under his tonge and grave hym so. 
And he dide so. 
And of these foure graynes spronge foure trees, 
as the angel seyd, 
which sholde bere a fruyt, 
thorgh which fruyt Adam 
sholde be saved. 
Of which trees was maad the Cros 
that bare God Jhesu Crist, 
that sweet fruyt thorgh which Adam 
and alle that come of hym were saved and deliverid 
fram eyndelys deth, 
but hit be here owen defaute. 
This Holy Cros hadde the Jewes i-hudde in the erthe under the roch of the mount of Calvarie, 
and hit lay ther 200 yer and more 
into that tyme 
that Seynt Eline fond hit. 
The which Seynt Eline 
was moder of Constantyn, 
the emperour of Rome, 
and sheo was doughter of a kyng, 
the which was kyng of Ingelond 
that was that tyme 
called the Greet Brytayne, 
when the emperour toke her 
to wyve for here greet fairnesse 
when he was in that contré. 
And ye shal understonde 
that the Cros of Oure Lord 
was of leyngthe of eyght cubitis, 
and that overthwart was of thre cubitis 
and an half. 
A party of the croune of Our Lord, 
wherwith He was i-crouned, 
and oon of the nailes, 
and the speer-heed, 
and many other relikes 
beth in Fraunce 
in the kynges chapel. 
And the croune beth 
in a vessel of cristal wel y-dight and richely. 
For a kyng of Fraunce 
somtyme boughte these relikis of the Jewes, 
to wham the em- perour had i-leyd 
to wedde 
for a greet somme of goolde and silver. 
And though [fol. 10r] hit be 
so that men sayn 
that hit beth thornes, 
ye shal understond 
that His was risshes of the see 
that beth white, wecle, and priketh 
as sharply as thornes. 
For I have sey many tymes 
that croune of Parys 
and also of Constantinople, 
for they beth but of oon y-maked of risshes of the see. 
But they have departed hem in two parties, 
of which oon party is at Parys 
and that other party is at Constantynople. 
And Y have a poynt therof, 
and that semeth whit thorn, 
and that was y-give 
to me for gret love, 
for ther beth many broken 
and fallen 
in the vessel 
wher the croun is, 
as they breken when men stiren the vessel 
to shewe the croune 
to greet lordes 
that cometh thider. 
And ye shal understonde that Our Lord, 
that nyght that He was take, 
He was lad into a gardeyn 
and there He was examined sharply. 
And ther the Jewes skorned Hym 
and makyd hym 
a croune of the branche of the albespine 
that growed in the same gardeyn 
and sette hit uppon His heed 
so faste 
that the blood ran adoun 
by many places of His visage, 
and His necke, 
and His shuldres. 
And therfor hath the albespyne many vertues. 
For he that berith a branch uppon hym, 
ne shal no thundre 
ne no tempest 
in no maner hym deer. 
Ne in the hous 
that hit is ynne 
may noon yvel spirit com, 
ne in place wheer hit is. 
And in the same gardeyn Seynt Petir deneyd Oure Lord God thries. 
And afterward Oure Lord was y-lad 
byfore the bysshopis of the lawe 
in another gardeyn of Anne, 
and ther He was examined 
and also y-skorned and y-crouned 
with a whit thorn 
that men callen barbarines 
that groweden in the same gardeyn, 
and that hath als many vertues. 
And then was He y-lad 
into the gardeyn of Cay- phas, 
and ther He was y-crouned with englenter. 
And then He was y-lad 
into the chambre of Pilat, 
and ther He was examined 
and also y-crouned. 
And tho the Jewes sette Hym [fol. 10v] 
on a chayre and clothid Hym 
in a mantel, 
and they makyd the croune 
of rysshes 
of the see 
and knelid to Hym 
and skorned Hym and sayde: 
Ave, rex Judeorum. 
That is to say: 
"Hayl, kyng of Jewes." 
And of this croune 
is oon halfen deel at Parys 
and that other deel at Constantinople. 
And this croune He hadde uppon His heed 
when He was doon on the Cros, 
and therfore hit is most worthi. 
And the sper shaft hath the emperour of Almayne, 
but the heed is at Paris. 
Also at Constantynnople 
lyth Seynt Anne Our Lady Moder, 
for Seynt Eline brought hure ther fro Jerusalem. 
And ther lith also the body of John Crisostom, 
that was bysshop of Constantinople. 
And ther lith Seynt Luke the Evangelist, 
for his bonys were brought 
fro Bethany 
wher he was grave. 
And many other relikes beth ther. 
And ther is the vestel of ston 
as hit were marble, which men callen ydrions, 
that ever more droppeth water 
and fillith hymself ech yer. 
And ye shal understond 
that Constantinople is right 
a fair cité and a good, 
and ryght wel y-walled, 
and hit is thre cornerid. 
And ther an arme of the see 
that men callen Hellesponte, 
and som callen hit Bouch of Constantynople, 
and som callen hit Brace de Seynt Gorge. 
And this water closeth two parties of the cité. 
And upwarde to the see 
uppon the water was y-woned 
to be the greet cité of Troye 
in a ful fair playn, 
but that cité was destroyed with men of Grece. 
And ther beth many iles 
that men callen thus: 
Calastre, Calcas, Cetige, Tesbiria, Arynona, Faxton, Molo, Carpate, and Lempne. 
And in this ile is the Mount Athos 
that passeth the cloudes. 
And ther beth many spechis 
and many contreis 
the which beth obesshant 
to the emperour, 
that is to saye Turcople, Pynornard, Coma, Comange, Trachise, and Macidone, 
of which Alisaundre was kynge, 
and many other. [fol. 11r] 
In this contré was Aristotle y-bore 
and in a cité 
that men callen Strages, 
a litle fro the cité of Trachye. 
And at Strages was Aristotle y-grave, 
and ther is an auter 
uppon his tumbe. 
And ther they make a greet feste every yer 
als though he were a seynt. 
And uppon his auter 
they holden greet conseylis. 
And they troweth that thorgh inspiracioun of God 
and of hym 
they shal have the better consail. 
In that contré beth right hyghe hilles, 
and toward the eynde of Macedone 
is a greet hille 
that men callen Olimpus, 
that departith Macedone and Trachie 
and is high up to the cloudes. 
And that other hille 
that men calleth Aches 
is so high that the shade of hym recheth to Olimpus 
that is neygh 77 myle bytwyne. 
And above that hille is the eyr 
so cleir that men 
may feile no wynd ther. 
And therfore may no beest lyve ther, 
for the eyr is so drigh. 
And men seyn in that contré that philosopheris 
som tyme wente 
uppon thilke hill 
and helde to here 
nose a sponge i-moisted 
with water 
to have the eyr. 
And above, 
in the poudre of the hill, 
they writen letteris 
with here fyngres, 
and at the yeris eynde they come ageyn 
and fyndeth the same lettres 
with oute eny faute. 
And at Constantynople the emperouris paleis 
is right fair and wel y-dight. 
And therin is a fair paleis for justyng, 
and hit is uppon stages, 
that alle men may see the justes, 
and under thilke stages beth stables 
vauted for the em perouris hors, 
and alle the pilouris beth of marbel. 
And withinne the cherche of Seynt Sophie 
a emperour wolde 
have i-graven his fader 
when he was deed. 
And they makid the grave 
and fond a body in the erthe, 
and theruppon lay a greet plate of fyn goold. 
And theruppon was i-writen 
in Ebru, Gru, and Latyn thus: 
Jhesu Cristus nascetur de Virgine Maria 
et ego credo in eum. 
That is to say: 
"Jhesu Crist shal be bore 
of the Virgyn Mari 
and I belyve on Hym." 
And the date of this, 
when hit was leyd in the erthe, 
was 2000 yer byfore that [fol. 11v] Our Lord was y-bore. 
And yit is that plate 
in the tresorie of that cherche. 
And men seyn that hit 
was the body of Hermogenes the wise man. 
And though hit be so 
that men of Grece beth Cristyn, 
yit they varieth fro youre feith. 
For they sey that the Holy Goost 
com nought of the Sone 
but fro the Fader, 
and they beth nought obesshent 
to the Cherche of Rome, 
nother to the pope. 
And they seyn that her patriarch 
hath als moche power over the see 
as the pope on this side. 
And therfore the Pope 
John the Twelfthe sende lettres 
to hem how Cristin feyth 
shold be all oon. 
And that thei sholde be obesshant 
to the Cherch of Rome 
and to the pope, 
that is Cristis vicar on erthe, 
to wham God gaf playn power 
for to bynde 
and to assoyle, 
and therfor they sholde be obedient to hym. 
And they sent agen to hym, the pope, divers let ters and anaswers, 
and among other thyng they seyde thus: 
Potenciam tuam summam circa tuos subdiectos firmiter credimus. 
Superbiam tuam summam tollerare non possumus. 
Avariciam tuam summam saciare non intendimus. 
Dominus tecum sit. 
Quia Dominus nobis- cum est. Vale. 
This is to say: 
"We trowe well thi power 
is greet uppon thy sogettis. 
We mai nought suffre thi greet pride. 
We beth nought in purpos 
to stanche thi greet covetise. 
Our Lord be with thee, 
for He is with us. Farwell." 
And other ans- wers had they non of hem. 
Also they makith here sacrament of sour loof breed, 
for Our Lord makid 
His of whete 
in tockinyng of the Maundé, 
and they drien hit by the sonne 
and kepen hit all the yer, 
and geven hit to sike instede of Godis body. 
And they maken but oon unctioun 
when they cristne children, 
and they anoynten noon sike man 
afor his deth. 
And they seyn that ther is noun Purgatory, 
and that soules shal have ne joye 
ne payne into the Day of Dome. 
And they tellen that sim- ple fornicacioun 
is no deedly [fol. 12r] synne but a kyndely thyng, 
and that men and wym- men 
shul be weddid but ons, 
and whoso wole be wedded more, 
her children beth but bastardes 
and i-gete in synne. 
And her prestis ben wedded as other ben. 
And they seyn that oker is noon synne dedly. 
And they sillen benefis of Holy Cherch, 
and so doth men in this contré, 
and that is a greet sclaundre. 
For now is simonie crouned kyng in Holi Cherche. 
They seyn also that in Lente men 
sholde synge no masse 
but uppon the Saterday 
and uppon the Soneday. 
And they fasteth nought the Saterday no tyme in all the yer, 
but hit be Youle Eve other Pasche Eve. 
And they suffre no man 
that cometh 
fro this side of the see 
to synge at her auters. 
But and hit falle 
that ther do by any happe, 
they wassh her autres 
afterward with holy water. 
And they seyn that ther sholde be said 
but oon masse at oon autre uppon the day. 
They seyn that Our Lord 
ne eet never mete, 
but He makid tocknyng of etyng. 
Also they seyn that we synne deedly 
in chavyng of oure beerdis, 
for the berd is knowyng a man fro a womman. 
Also they seyn that we synne in etyng of beestis 
that were de fendid in the Oolde Lawe, 
als swyn, hares, 
and other beestis. 
And they seyn that we synne in etyng of flessh in the Wennesday, 
als when we eete cheese other eyron on the Fryday. 
And they cursen all tho 
that etyn no flessh uppon the Saturday. 
Also the emperour of Constantynople maketh 
alle the patriarkys, 
archebysshoppes, and bysshoppes, 
and geveth alle the digniteis and cherches, 
and he depriveth hem 
that ben worthi of the pryvacion. 
Now thowe hit be so that thes thynges toucheth nought to my way, 
yyt hit likith to many men 
to hyre of the condicioun and lawes and maneris 
of diverse londes and contrees. 
And [fol. 12v] 
this is the ferst contré 
that is discordant agen our feithe, 
ther- fore I have setten here 
that ye may wite the diversité 
that is bytwixt our feith and heres, 
for many man hath desier 
to here speke of diverse thynges. 
AGEYN TO THE WAY. 
CAPITULUM SECUNDUM. [Chapter 2.] 
Now come I ageyn to know the way 
fro Constantynople. 
Whoso wole go thorgh Turkye, 
he goth thorgh the cité of Nyke 
and passeth thorgh the gate of Thoimtot 
that is ful hygh, 
and hit is a myle 
and an half fro Nyke. 
And whoso wole may go 
by the Brace of Seynt George, 
and by the greet see, 
ther Seynt Nicholas lith. 
And ferst men cometh 
to the ile of Cilo. 
In that ile groweth mastik 
uppon smale trees, 
as plum trees other chery trees. 
And then men goth thorgh the ile of Pathmos, 
ther wroot Seynt John 
the Evaungelist the Apocalips. 
And when Our Lord deide, 
Seynt John was of eelde of 32 yer 
and he levede 
after the Passion of Crist 62 yer. 
Fro Pathmos men goth to Ephesome, 
a fair cité and neygh to the see, 
and ther deide Seynt John 
and was grave byhiende the autre in a tumbe. 
And ther is a fair cherche 
in that place 
that Cristen men were woned holde. 
But in the tumbe of Seynt John 
is nothyng elles but manna, 
for his body was translatid into Paradis. 
Turkes haldeth now 
that cité 
and all Asie the Lasse, 
and therfor hit is called Turkey. 
And ye shal understande that Seynt John leet make his grave 
by his lyve 
and laide hymself therinne al quyk. 
And therfor som seyn 
that he deide nought 
but that he restith therynne 
onto the Day of Dome. 
And forsothe ther is a greet mervaile, 
for men may se apartly 
the erthe of the tumbe 
many tymes stire and meve, 
as ther were a quyk thyng ther under. 
And fro Ephesome men 
goth thorghe many iles 
in the see 
unto the cité of Pathan, 
wher Seynt Nicholas was bore, 
and so to Marcha 
wher he was chose 
to be bysshop, 
and ther [fol. 13r] groweth ryght good wyn and strong, 
that men callen wyn of Marcha. 
And fro then men may se the iles of Grece, 
the which the emperour gaff somtyme to Jonays. 
And then men passen thurgh the iles of Cofos and Lango, 
of wham Ypocras was lord. 
And som sayn that in the ile of Lango 
is Ypocrasis doughter 
in maner of a dragon 
that is a hundred foot long, 
as men seyn, 
for I have hit nought seye. 
And men of the iles callen here 
ladi of the contrees. 
And sheo lith in an old castel 
and shewith her thre tymes a yer. 
And she doth no man harm 
but if any man do her harm, 
and thus she is changed 
fro a damysel to dragon 
thorgh a goddas 
that men callen Diana. 
And men seyn 
that she shal dwelle 
so 
into the tyme 
that a knyght come 
that is so hardy 
that der go to hure 
and kysse here mouth. 
And then shal she turne agen 
into hure owen kynde and be womman, 
and therafter heo shal nought lyve longe. 
And hit is nought ferne ago 
that a knyght of Rodes, 
that was doughti and hardy, 
seyde that he wolde kysse her. 
And when he was uppon his hors 
and wente to the castel 
and entred into the cave, 
the dragon bygan to lift up his heed agen hym. 
And when the knyght say the huge beest 
he fled away. 
And the dragon folwed 
and took hym 
and bare hym 
maugre his teeth 
uppon a roch 
and cast hym into the see 
and so was he lost. 
And also a yong man 
that wist nought of that dragon 
went out of a shippe 
and went thorgh the ile tille he com to that castel 
and come to that cave. 
And he went so longe 
til he fond a chambre. 
And ther he saw a damisel 
and she kembid hure heed 
and lokyde on a myrrour, 
and sheo hadde moche trosour aboute hure. 
And he wente that sheo hadde be a comyn womman 
that dwellid ther 
to kepe men to dele with here. 
He abood ther, 
and tho the damysel saw the shade [fol. 13v] 
of hym in the merour. 
She turned her and asked what he wolde, 
and he seyde he wolde 
be hure paramour other hure lemman. And she askid hym 
wher he were a knyght, 
and he saide nay. 
And then she saide 
that she myght nought 
be his lemman, 
but she baad hym go ageyn 
to his felawes 
and make hym a knyght 
and come ageyn on the morghe, 
and she wolde com out of hure cave 
and baad hym thenne kysse hure on the mouth. 
And she baad hym 
that he sholde have no drede. 
"For Y shal do thee noon harme, 
for thow thou thenke 
that Y am 
hidous," she sayde, 
"ghit drede thee nought, 
for hit is don to me by enchauntement. And if thou kysse my mouth, 
thou shalt se me as thou dost nough. 
And thou shalt have alle these tresours, 
and be my lord 
and lord of these iles." 
And he departid fro here 
and come to his felawes 
to the shippe 
and ther they makyde hym knyght. 
And come aghen 
uppon the morghe 
to kysse that damsel. 
And when he saw her come 
out of her cave 
in shap of a drag 
on he hadde so greet drede 
that he fleyghe 
to the shippe ayen. 
And she folwyd hym, 
and when she saw 
that he turned nought agen, she bygan to crie 
as a thyng 
that hadde gret drede 
and greet sorwe, 
and she went agen to hure cave. 
And anoon this knyght deide. 
And sithen hiderward 
myght no knyght se hure 
but he deyde anoon. 
But when a knyght cometh 
that is so hardy to kysse hure mouth, 
he shal turne 
that damysel 
to hure owen shappe, 
and be lord of the contré byforeseyd. 
And fro thenne men cometh 
to ile of Rodes, 
whiche that the Hospitalers holden. 
And that ile was somtyme take 
fro the Emperour 
and was woned somtyme be y-called Colles, 
and so callen the Turkes yit. 
And Seynt Poule 
in his pistle wrot 
to the men of that ile. [fol. 14r] 
This yle is fer 8 hundred myle fro Constantinople. 
And fro this yle of Rodis 
men goth to Cipre, 
wher beth many vines 
that ferst beth reed 
and after oon yer 
they wexen all white. 
And the vines that beth most white 
beth most cleer 
and most smellyng. 
And men passith 
by this way 
by a place 
where was woned be a greet cité 
that men callid Satalay. 
And al that contré was lost 
thorgh foly of a yong man, 
for he hadde a fair damysel 
that he lovede, 
and she dayde sodenly 
and was y-do in grave of marble. 
And for the greet love 
that he hadde to hure, 
he wente on the nyght 
to here grave and oppenyd hit, 
and lay by here 
and went his way. 
And at the 9 monthes ende, 
a voys come to hym and seyde, 
"Go to the tumbe 
of that womman 
and opene the tumbe 
and byhold 
what thow hast gyte on here. 
And if thow lette for to goo, 
thee worth greet harm have." 
And he yede and opened the tumbe, 
and ther fley an heed ryght parolous 
to se that fley 
even aboute the cité. 
And anoon the cité sanke adoun. 
And therfore ther beth many parolous passages. 
And fro Rodes to Cipre 
is neyr five hundred myle. 
But men may go to Cipre, 
and come nought at Rodes. 
Cipre is a good ile 
and a greet, 
and ther beth many good citeis. 
And ther is an erchebysshop at Nichosie, 
and foure other bysshoppis 
is in that lond. 
And at Famagost is oon of the best haven uppon the see 
that is in the worlde. 
And ther aryveth Cristen men and Sarizynes 
and many other nacions. 
And in Cipre 
is the hille of the Holy Cros 
and is an abbey of monokis, 
and ther is the cros of Dismas the good theef, 
as I seide byfore. 
And som men weneth that ther 
is the half of the Cros of Our Lord, 
but hit is noght so. 
In Cipre lith Genonon 
of wham men 
of that contré maketh greet solemnté. 
And in the castel [fol. 14v] 
of Amors lith the body of Seynt Hillari. 
And biside Famagost was Seynt Bernard i-bore. 
In Cipre men hunteth with paupyons, 
and tho beth like to libardes, 
and tho take wylde beestis ryght wel. 
And they ben sumdel more than lyons. 
In Cipre is a maner 
that lordes 
and alle other men usen. 
They opne the erthe, 
for they maken diches deep in the erthe 
al aboute the halle to the knee. 
And they do pave the grounde bynethe. 
And when they wole ete they go therynne, 
and sitten ther and eten, 
for they wold be the more fressh, for that londe 
is more hatter than here. 
And at greet festes 
and also for strange men 
they setten formes and bordes 
as men don heer, 
but hem were levere sitte on the erthe. 
A WEY BY THE SEE TO JERUSALEM. 
CAPITULUM TERCIUM. [Chapter 3.] 
Fro Cipres men goon 
by londe to Jerusalem 
and by see also. 
And in a day 
and in a nyght 
he that hath good wynde may come 
to the haven of Tire, 
that is now i- called Sirre. 
And hit is at the entré of Syrrie, 
wher was somtyme a fair cité of Cristen men, 
but Sarizens hath destried 
hit a gret party therof, 
and they kepe well 
that haven for drede of Cristyn men. 
Men myght go more ryght 
to that havene 
and come noght to Cipre, 
but men goon gladly to Cipre 
to reste hem in the londe 
other els to bye hem thyng 
that hem nedeth. 
Uppon the seeside bossh many men may fynde. 
And ther is the well 
that holy wryt spekith of thus: 
Fons ortorum puteus aquarum vivencium. 
That is to say: 
"well of gardeyns 
and dike of wateris lyvyng." 
In the cité of Tire seyde the womman to Our Lord: 
Beatus venter qui te portavit 
et ubera que suxisti. 
That is to say: 
"I-blessid be the body 
that thee baar, 
and the pappes that thow souke." 
And ther Our Lord forgaf the womman of Canane here synnes. 
And byfore Tire was woned 
to be the ston 
uppon which Our Lord saat to preche. 
And of that ston was y- [fol. 15r] -founded the cherch of Seynt Savouris. 
Uppon that see is the Saphen, 
Sarepte or Sydonis, 
ther was woned 
to dwelle Helias the prophete. 
And ther raysed Jonas the prophete the wydew sone. 
And 5 mile fro Saphen 
is the cité of Cidone, 
on which cité was Dido dwellyng 
that was somtyme Enyas wiff 
after the destruxion of Troye. 
And she fundide the cité of Cartage 
in Affrik 
that now is y-called Didon. 
And in Tire reyneth Achilles 
that was Didois fader. 
And 18 mile fro Didon 
is the cité of Brenche, 
and fro Brenche to Sardana 
is thre journeis, 
and fro Sardana is 5 mile to Damas. 
Whoso wole go lenger wey by see, 
and come neer to Jerusalem, 
he shall go fro Cypre by see to port Jaffe, 
for that is the next haven to Jerusalem, 
for fro that haven is 
but a dayes jorney 
and an half to Jerusalem. 
That haven is y-called Jaffe, 
and the toun Affe, 
after oon of Noeis sones 
that men callen Japhet 
that makid hit. 
And ye shal understonde 
that hit 
is the yldest toun of the worlde, 
for hit was makyd 
byfore Noeis floode. 
And ther beth bones of gyauntes sides 
that ben fourty foot long. 
And whoso ryveth 
at the ferst haven of Tire other of Surrye, 
they may go by londe to Jerusalem. 
Then shal they go 
to the cité of Acon, 
and hit standith in the see. 
And fro Venyse hit is to Acon 
by the see 200 and 80 mile of Lumbardy. 
And fro Calabre, other Cecile, 
is Acon 1300 myle of Lumbardy. 
And byside the cité of Acon 
toward the see 120 furlang on the right side, 
toward the south, 
is the hille of Carme, 
wher Elias the prophete dwellide. 
And ther was the order of frere Carmes ferst funded. 
And at the foot of this hille 
was somtyme a cité of Cristen men 
that men called Cayphas, for Cayphas funded hit, 
but now hyt is y-wasted. 
And at the lift side of that hille 
is a toun 
that men callen Caffere, 
and that is y-sette uppon another hille. 
Ther was Seynt Jame and Seynt John ybore. 
And fro Acon men goon 
to a greet hille 
that is y-called Scale de Terreys, 
that is of an hundred furlang. 
And therby is the Fosse Ynone all rounde, 
that [fol. 15v] 
is nyghe a hundred cubites brode, 
and hit is ful of gravel shynynge 
of which maketh good verres and cler. 
And men comen fer by see 
and by londe and with cartes to take of that gravel. 
And thow hit be take 
never so moche uppon a day, 
hit is never the lasse uppon the morwe, 
for hit is ful agen, 
and that is a greet mervayle. 
And ther is evermore greet wynd 
in that fosse 
that stireth alway 
that gravel and makith hit troble. 
And if a man do theron any metal, 
hit shal wex anoon glas. 
And that glas 
that is ymakyd of this gravel, 
if hit be do ageyn 
to the gravel 
hit turneth agen to gravel 
as hit was ferst. 
And som men sayn that hit is a swolwyng of the Gravely See. 
And also fro Acon 
men goth thre jorneis 
to the cité of Philistion 
that now is y-called Gaza, 
that is to say a riche cité. 
And hit is a ryght fayr 
and full of folke, 
and hit is a lytle in the see. 
And ther slow Sampson the fort 
the kyng in his palys, 
and many thousand with hym, 
for he makyd the hous 
falle uppon hem. 
And fro then, 
men shul go to the cité of Cesarie, 
and so to the castel Pellarines, 
and so to Ascalon 
and so to Japhet, and so to Jerusalem. 
THE WAY TO BABYLOYN. 
CAPITULUM QUARTUM. [Chapter 4.] 
Now whoso wole go by lond to Babiloyne 
wher the soudan dwellith, 
for to have leve to go the more sikerly 
and for to go to the Mount Synay 
or he come to Jeru- salem, 
he shal go fro Gaza 
to the castel of Dadayr. 
And after that a man comth out of Surrye, 
he goth into wildernysse, 
wher the wey is ful sondy. 
And that wildernysse lestith 8 journeys, 
wher men fyndeth all that hem nedith of vitalles. 
And men callen that wildernysse Athillok. 
And when a man comth out of this desert, 
he entrith into Egipt. 
And they callen hit Egipt Canaphat, 
and in another langage, 
men callen hit Mercyne. 
And the ferst good toun 
that men fyndeth 
is ycalled Beleth, 
and hit is 
at the ende of the kyngdom of [fol. 16r] Alape. 
And fro thenne men come to Babiloyne, 
and to Cayr. 
And in Babiloyn 
is a fair cherche of Our Lady 
wher she dwellid 7 yer 
when she was out of the lond of Jude, 
for drede of the kyng Herodes. 
And ther lith the body of Seynt Barbara the virgyn. 
And ther dwellid Joseph 
when he was y-sold 
of his bretherin, 
and ther Nabu- godonosor 
let put thre children into the fuyr 
for they were of ryght feith, 
the which children ben called Anania, Azaria, and Misael. 
But Nabugodonosor callid hem thus: Cidrac, Misac, and Abdenago. 
Ther dwellith the soudan, 
for ther is a fayr cité 
and a strong castel 
wel y-sette uppon a rooch. 
In that castel is dwellyng allway, 
to kepe hit and to serve the soudan, 
more then 8000 persones of folk, 
whoch taketh alle the necessaries of the soudan. For this is y-knowe wel, 
for Y dwelled in his courte, 
and was soudier, 
and in his werris a greet 
while agenst the Bedoyns. 
And he wolde have y-weddid me 
to a greet princes 
doghter ful richely, 
if Y wolde have forsake my byleve. 
And ye shal understonde 
that the soudan is lord of fyve kyngdomis 
the which he hath conquerid 
and y-gete by streyngthe. 
Thes beth tho: Canapate, 
that is Egipte; 
the kyngdom of Jerusalem, 
of the which David and Salomon were kyngs; 
the kyngdom of Surry, 
of which the cité of Damas was chief; the kyngdom of Anolpe; 
and the kyngdom of Arabie, 
and that was oon of the thre kynges 
that bar offryng to Our Lord. 
And many other londes he holdeth on his hond. 
And the mount of Seynt Katerine 
is moch heyr than the Mount Moyses. 
And ther that Seynt Katerine was y-grave 
is no cherche ne chapel 
ne non other dwellyng place, 
but ther is a hille of stones 
y-gadred togedres with angeles. 
But ther was woned 
to be a chaple 
but hit was destruyd, 
and yit lith the stones ther. 
And thow hit be so [fol. 16v] 
that the orison of Seynt Katerin maketh mencion 
that hit is on the place 
wher Our Lord gaf the Lawe to Moyses, 
and ther Seynt Katerin was y-grave, 
ye shullith understonde 
that hit 
is in oon contré other in oon stede 
that berith al oon name. 
For they beth bothe called Synay, 
but hit is a greet way 
bytwyne hem 
and a greet valey. 
A WEY TO JERUSALEM. 
CAPITULUM QUINTUM. [Chapter 5.] 
Now sithen a man hath y-visited this holy place of Seynt Katerin 
and he traveyle agen to Jerusalem, 
he shal take leve of the monkes and recommende hym into here prayers. 
The which monkes geveth gladly vitaylis 
to pylgrimes 
that passith thorgh 
that wildernisse to Surry, 
which lasteth ney 12 journeys. 
And in that desert dwellith many Arabynes, 
and Bydoynes, and Ascopardes, 
which ben folk 
of alle maner yvel condiciouns. 
And they have noon houses but tentis, 
which they make of beistis skynnes, 
as of camels and of other beistis. 
And they that dwellith ther 
may have noon water 
but of the Reede See, 
for in that greet wildernisse 
is a greet de- faute of water. 
And hit fallith ofte tyme 
wher a man fyndeth water oon tyme, 
he fyndeth noon another tyme, 
and therfore they maketh ther none hous but tentis. 
Thes men tylieth no lond, 
for they eetith no breed, 
but hit be eny 
that dwellith toward any good toun. 
And they rosteth all here 
flessh uppon hote stones ageyn the sonne. 
And they beth strong men 
and wel fyghtyng, 
and they doth noght elles 
but chase wilde deer 
and beestis for hure sustinaunce. 
And they tellen noght 
by her liff, 
and therfore they dreden noght the soudan, 
for they beth ofte at werre with hym. 
And at that same tyme that Y was dwellyng with hym, 
they bare noght 
but a shilde 
and a sper to defende hem with. 
And they have noon other armure 
but wyndeth her hedis 
and here neckis 
in greet lynnen cloth. 
And when men ben passid this wildernisse toward Jerusalem, 
they comen to Bersabe, 
that was somtyme a fair toun of Cristen men 
and yit ther beth some of here cherchis. [fol. 17r] 
And in that toun dwellid Abraham the patriarch, 
which toun fund- ede Urie, 
of whas wyf David engendrid Salomon the wyse, 
that was kyng of Jeru- salem 
and of the 12 kingdomes of Israel, 
and he regned 40 yer. 
And fram then men goth 
to the Vale of Ebron, 
that is neye fro thenne 12 myle. 
And som callen hit the Vale of Mambre. 
Also hit is called the Vale of Teres, 
for as moche as Adam wept 
in that valey 
an 100 yer 
for the deth of his sone Abel, 
the which Caim slow. 
And Ebron was somtyme the principal cité of Philistiens, 
and ther dwellid gyauntes. 
Ther Josue, Calofe, 
and her company 
com ferst to aspie 
how thay myghte wynne the Londe of Promission. 
In Ebron, David regned ferst 7 yer and an half, 
and in Jerusalem he regned 33 yer and an half. 
And in Ebron beth all graves of patriarkes, David, Abraham, Jacob, 
and her wyves, Eve, Sarra, and Rebecca; 
and they beth in a hongynge of an hull. 
And under hem is a wel fayr cherche corneld as a castel, 
which the Sarasynnes kepeth wel 
and they worshippeth moch that place 
for the holy patriarkes 
that lygen ther. 
And they suffre noon Cristyn man 
to come therynne, 
but they have special leve of the soudan, 
for thei holden Cristen men and Jewes but houndes 
that ne sholde come in none holy place. 
And they callen that place 
Spelunke other double cave, 
for that on is on that other. 
And Sarasynnes hit callith 
in her langage Cariatharba, 
that is to say Habrahamis hous. 
And that was he 
that sat 
in his dore 
and saw thre persones 
and worshipped oon, 
as Holy Writ sayth: 
Tres vidit et unum adoravit. 
That is to say: 
"He say thre and oon worsheped." 
And hym toke Abraham 
into his hous. 
And ryght ney to that place 
is a cave 
wher Adam and Eve dwellid in a rooch 
when they were dryve out of Paradise, 
and ther gete they her children. 
And in that same place was Adam makid 
as som men sayn, 
for men called that place the felde of Damas, 
for hit was the lordship of Damas. 
And fro thenne he was translatyd into Paradis 
and afterward [fol. 17v] 
he was dryven out of Paradis 
and y-put ther agen; 
for the same day 
that he was put into Paradys, 
the same day he was dryven out of Paradis, 
anoon as he hadde synned. 
Ther bygynneth the Vale of Ebron and lasteth ney to Jerusalem. 
And the angel bad Adam 
that he sholde dwelle 
with his wiff 
and ther engendre Seth, 
of which kyn Jhesu Crist was y-bore. 
And in that felde 
is a place 
that men draweth a thyng 
that men callen cambil, 
and they eten that instede of spyces. 
And may no man make that place so deep 
and so wyde that hit 
is at the yeres ende full agen 
by the grace of God. 
And two myle fro Ebron 
is a grave of Loth 
that is Abrahamis brother. 
And a litle fro Ebron is the Mount Mambre, 
of which the vale took his name. 
And ther is a tree of ook 
that Sarysynis callen dirpe, 
that is of Abrahamis tyme, 
that men callen the drie tree. 
And they say that hit hath be 
fro the bygynnyng of the worlde, 
and hit was somtyme grene 
and bar leves 
into that tyme 
that Our Lord deyde. 
And so dide all the trees in the worlde, 
other els they fayled here hertes, 
and yit beth many soch in the worlde. 
And som prophecie seith that a prince, 
lord of the west syde of the worlde, 
shal come and wynne the Londe of Promission 
with the help of Cristen men. 
And he shal do synge a messe 
under the drie tre, 
and hit shal wexe grene 
and bere fruyt and leves. 
And by that miracle many Sarysynes and Jewes 
and other shal be turned to Cristen feythe. 
And therfore they do greet worship therto 
and kepith hit ful well. 
And thow hit be drie, 
hit hath gret vertue, 
for certayn he 
that hath a litle therof on hym, 
hit helith hym of the fallyng yvel. 
And hit hath many other vertues, 
and ther- fore hit is y-holde ryght precious. 
Fro Ebron men goth to Bethleem 
on half a day, 
for hit is but 5 myle bytwyne, 
and hit is a perlous way 
and thorgh wodes ryght lykynge. 
But Bedlem is right a lykyng cité and lytle, 
[fol. 18r] 
but hit is long and narwe 
and wel y-walled 
and enclosid with dych. 
And hit was woned 
to be called Effrata, 
as Holy Writ seith: 
Ecce audivimus eum in Effrata. 
That is to say: 
"Lo, we have herd hym in Effrata." 
Toward the ende of that cité 
toward the est is a fair cherch 
and a gracious, 
and hit hath many toures 
and many pynacles 
and corneld ful strongly. 
And in that cherch beth 43 pylers of marble, greet and fayr. 
And bytwyne this cherch 
and this cité 
is a feyld 
that is callid Feyld Floridous, 
that is to seye Feyld Floryshid. 
For as moche as a fayr 
mayde was y-blamed falsly 
that she hadde y-do fornicacioun, 
for which cause heo was demed 
to the deth 
and to be brende 
in that place 
to the which she was y-lad. 
And as the wode 
bygan 
to brenne aboute her, 
she prayed to God: 
as she was noght gylty of that thing, 
that He helpe here 
that hit were y-knowe to alle men. 
And when she had thus y-sayd, 
anoon was that fire oute. 
And the branches 
that were brennyng 
bycome ride roses, 
and the branches 
that were noght brennyng 
bycome white rosers 
and ful of roses. 
And ther were the ferste roses 
and rosers 
that ever were y-seyn afore. 
And thus was this mayde y-saved. 
Also byside the queir of the cherche, 
at the ryght syde 
as men cometh doun- ward 17 gres, 
is a place where God was y-bore, 
that is now ful wel y-dyght with marble, 
and gold, and sylver, 
and asure, 
and y-peynted 
with other riche colouris. 
And a lytle thenne 
at thre paas 
is the cribbe of the oxe and the asse. 
And bysyde is the place 
wher the sterre fell 
that ladde the thre kynges: Jaspar, Melchiser, and Balthasar. 
But men of Grece 
thes thre kynges thus callen Galgalath, Galgagat, and Saragi. 
Thes thre kynges offeride 
to Our Lord 
ensence, goold, and myrre. 
And they come togedre thorw Godes grace, 
for they mette sommen 
in a cité of Inde 
that men callen Casak, 
that is foure journeys fro Bethlem, 
and they were in Bethlem the ferthe day 
after they hadde i-seye the sterre. 
Also under the cloistre of the cherch, 
[fol. 18r] 
8 gres at the ryght side, 
is the charnel of the Innocentis 
wher the bones lyggen. 
And byfore that place 
that Crist was y-bore 
is the tumbe of Seynt Jerom, 
that was a cardinall 
that translatid the Bible 
and the sautre fro Ebru into Latyn. 
And byside that cherch 
is a cherche of Seynt Nicholas 
wher Our Lady rested here 
when she was delyveryd of childe. 
And for she hadde so moche mylke in here 
pappes that hit greved here, 
she mylkyd hit out 
uppon the reed stones of marble, 
so that yit men may see the traces, 
for they beth y-sene uppon the stones. 
And ye shal understonde 
that alle that dwellith in Bethlem beth Cristen men. 
And ther beth fair vines 
aboute the cité 
and greet plenté of wyn. 
But here bokes of Macametis lawe 
forbedeth hem to drynke wyn, 
for in that book he acurseth all tho that drynketh wyn, 
for synne that he slow an heremyte 
that he loved well in his dronknes. 
But his malys torned to hymself, 
as Holy Wryt seyth: 
Et in verticem ipsius iniquitas eius descendet. 
That is to say: 
"And his wyckednesse descendid into his owen 
heed." 
Also thes Sarazens bryngeth forth noon gryces, 
nother they eteth of none, 
ne of noon swynes flessh, 
for hit is brother to man 
and hit was forbode in the Olde Lawe. 
Also in the lond of Palastine, 
nother in the lond of Egipte, 
they eten litle veel other beoff, 
but hit be so olde 
that hit 
ne may namore travayle ne worche. 
But noght as hit were forbode, 
but forto kepe hem 
for telyng of here londe. 
Of this cité of Bedlem was David Kyng y-bore, 
and he hadde 60 wyves and 300 lemans. 
Fro Bedlem to Jerusalem 
is bote two myle. 
At the half myle 
fro Jerusalem 
is a cherche 
wher the angel seyde 
to the shephurd 
of the beryng of Cryst. 
In the way is the tumbe of Rachel, 
that was Joseph moder the patriarch. 
And she deyde also sone 
as she hadde bore Benjamyn, 
and Jacob here hosebande sette 12 greet stones 
uppon here in tocknyng 
that she hadde y-bore 12 children. 
In this way to Jerusalem beth many Cristen cher[fol. 19r]ches 
by which men goth to Jerusalem. 
JERUSALEM. 
CAPITULUM SEXTUM. [Chapter 6.] 
For to speke of Jerusalem, 
ye shal understonde 
that hit stondith fayre among hilles, 
and ther is no ryver 
but water 
that cometh 
by condiht fro Ebron. 
And men callid hit ferst Jebus 
and sythe was hit called Solomee 
into the tyme of Kyng David, 
and he sette these two names 
in samen and callid hit Jebusalem. 
And then come Salomon 
and callid hit Jerusalem, 
and so hit is yit y-called. And aboute Jerusalem 
is the kyngdom of Syrry, 
and ther ney 
is the lond of Pal- astine and Ascalon, 
but Jerusalem is in the lond Jude. 
And hit is y-called Jude for Judas Machabeus 
was kyng of that lond. 
And hit marcheth estward 
uppon the kyng- dom of Arabye, 
on the south syde uppon the lond of Egypte, 
on the west syde uppon the Gret See, 
on the north side uppon the kyngdom of Syrry 
and the see of Cipre. 
In Jerusalem was somtyme a patriarch 
and an erchebysshop, 
and bisshopes aboute in the contré. Aboute Jerusalem beth thees citeis: Ebron at 7 myle, Jerico at 6 myle, Bersabe at 8 myle, Ascalon at 18 myle, Jaffe at 27 myle, Ramatha at 3 myle, Bethlem at 2 myle. 
And toward the south is a cherche of Mercaritot, 
that was abbot of Seynt Mercaritot, 
for wham they makyd moche sorwe 
when he sholde deye. 
And hit is y-peyntyd there 
how they makyd deol 
when he deyde. 
This lond of Jerusalem hath y-be 
in hond of diverse nacions, 
as Jewes, Can- aneus, Assirienes, Perces, Medoynes, Massydoyns, Grecis, Romayns, Cristen men, Sarasyns, Barbaryns, and Turkes, and many other naciouns with hem. 
For Crist wole noght 
that hit be longe 
in hondes of traytouris, 
nother of synwers, 
be hit Cristen men other no. 
And mysbylive men haveth holde that lond 
in her hond 
40 yer and more, 
but they shul noght holde hit 
to longe yif God wole. 
When men beth at Jerusalem, 
they goth the ferste pilgrimage 
to the cherche 
wher is the holy grave. 
And that is out of the cité 
on the north [fol. 19v] syde, 
but hit is y- closed 
yn with toun walles. 
And ther is a fayr cherche round up above 
and wel y- helid with leed. 
And on the west syde 
is a fayr tour 
and strong for bellys. 
In the myddel of the cherche is a tabernacle, 
as a lytle hous, 
y-makyd in the manere of an half compas, 
wel rychely of goolde 
and asure and other colouris. 
And on the ryght syde 
is the sepulcre of Our Lord, 
and that tabernacle is 8 foot long and 5 foot wyde and 11 foot of hythe. 
And hit is noght longe siththe the sepulcre 
was all opne, 
that men myghte kysse hit and touche hit. 
But for men that come thyder forfyde hem 
to breke the stone in pecys, 
therfore the soudan 
hath do makyd 
a wal aboute the sepulcre, 
that no man may touche hit 
but on the lyft syde. 
On that tabernacle is no wyndow, 
but therynne beth many laumpes lyght. 
And ther is a laumpe 
that hongeth afore the sepulcre brennynge, 
and on the Fryday he goth out by hymself 
and lyghtith agen by hymself 
at that oure 
that Our Lord aroos fram deth to lyff. 
Also withynne 
that cherche on the ryght syde is the mount of Calvarie, 
wher Crist was don on the Cros. 
And the Cros was y-sette 
in a morteyse in the rooch, 
that is whyte of colour 
and a lytle reed 
y-medled therwith. 
And uppon that rooch droppyd 
that blood of Cristes woondis 
when He was pyned on the Cros. 
And in that mortais was Adamis hed y-fonde 
after Noeis flood 
in tocknyng of Adamis synnes 
sholde be bought in that place. 
And above makyd Adam sacrifise to Our Lord, 
and ther is an auter and byfore 
that auter lith Godfray the Boleyn, 
and Baudewyn, 
and other that were Cristyn kynges of Jerusalem. 
And ther that Our Lord was doon on Cros 
is y-wryte in Gru: 
Otheos basilion ysmon presomas ergaste sothias oys. 
That is to say in Latyn thus: 
Hic deus rex noster 
ante secula operatus 
est salutem in medio terre. [fol. 20r] 
That is to say thus: 
"God, our kyng 
byfore the worlde, 
hath makyd hele 
in the myd of the erthe." 
Also uppon the roche 
wher the Cros is pyght 
is y-wryte 
withynne the roche in Gru: 
Gros giust rasis tou pestes toy tesmoysy. 
That is to say in Latyn thus: 
Quod vides est fundamentum tocius mundi et huius fidei. 
That is to say thus: 
"That thou seist is ground 
of alle the worlde 
and of this 
feith." 
And ye shal understonde that Our Lord 
when He deyde was of 32 yer old and thre monthes. 
And the prophecie of David seyde 
that He sholde have 40 yer 
when he seyd thus: 
Quadraginta annis proximus fui generacioni huic. 
That is to say: 
"40 yer was Y neyghbore to this generacioun." 
And thus sholde hit seme 
that the prophecie of David were noght trywe. 
But ye shal understonde 
that hit is trywe, 
for in the olde tyme men maked the yer of 10 monthes, 
of which Mars was first and Decembre was last. 
But Gayus Cesar, 
that was emperour of Rome, 
let sette thes two monthes therto, Janyver and Feverer, 
and ordeyned the yer of 12 monthes, 
that is to say 360 
and 5 dayes 
withoute lepe yer. 
And therfore 
by a good countes 
of that ten monthes 
to yer of Cristes dayes in the 40 yer, 
and after oure yeres of 12 monthes, 
He had 32 yer and thre monthis. 
Also withynne the mounte of Calvarie 
at the ryght syde is an auter wher the pylour lith 
that Crist was bounde to when He was y-skorgid. 
And ther at 42 gres deep 
was the very Cros founde 
by a seynt 
that was cleped Seynt Elene under a roche 
wher the Jewes hadde hydde hit. 
And hit was asayed, 
for they fonde thre crosses: 
oon of Our Lord 
and two of the two theves. 
For Seynt Elene asayed hem 
on a deed body, 
which that aroos anoon 
as the veray Cros 
was leyd on hym. 
And ther neygh is the place in a wal 
wher the thre nayles of Our Lord were y- hydde, 
and He hadde two nayles 
in His hondes 
and oon in His feet. 
And of oon of these nayles 
the emperour of Constantynople [fol. 20v] 
let make a brydel 
to his hors 
when he rood into batayl, 
for by vertu therof he overcome his enymyes 
and wan all the londes of Asy, Turky, Damacyn the More 
and the Lesse, Sirrye, Jerusalem, Arabie, Perce, Mesopotayne, 
the kyngdom of Alappe, 
Egipte the Hyghe and the Lowe, 
and other kyngdomes many into Ethiope 
and into Ynde the Lasse, 
that tho was Cristen. 
But they ben now in hondes of paynems and Sarasyns. 
But when God wole, 
ryght as these londes ben lost 
by synne of Cristen men, 
they shal be wonnen agen 
thorgh help of Almyghty God. 
And in the myddel of this cherche 
is a compas 
in which Joseph of Barmathia leyd the body of Our Lord 
when he hadde Hym take doun of the Cros. 
And that compas, men seyn, 
hit is in the myddel of the world. 
And in the cherche of the Sepulcre 
in the north syde is the place 
wher Our Lord was don into prison, 
for He was in prison in many places. 
And ther is som of the cheyne 
with the which He was y-bounde. 
And ther He aperyd first to Marie Maudeleyn 
after His Uprysynge. 
In that Cherche of the Sepulcre were y-woned 
to be chanouns 
of the ordre of Seynt Benet, 
and they hadde a priour, 
but the patriarke was her soverayn. 
And withoute the cherche dores 
at the ryght syde, 
as men gon up 18 gres, 
seyd Crist to His moder: 
Mulier ecce filius tuus. 
That is to say: 
"Woman, 
byhold thy sone." 
Deinde dicit discipulo, 
ecce mater tua. 
That is to say: "Then seyde He to His disciple, 
byhold thy 
moder." 
And these wordes He seyde uppon the Cros. 
And under these gres, 
prestes syngen her Masses, 
but noght as we don. 
And they maketh alwey the sacrament 
on the auter of bred, 
as we don, 
seynge the Pater Noster 
and other thyng also 
as they sey the wordes of sacrament. 
But they have noght the addiciouns 
of the orisons 
in privité of the Masse. 
And that is for they know noght the addiciouns 
that we have. 
And ye shal understonde 
that byfore [fol. 21r] this cherche is the cité feblist, 
for the gret playn 
that is bytwyne the cité 
and the cherche uppon the est syde. 
Withoute the walles of the cité 
is the Vale of Josaphat 
that comth to the walles. 
In that vale without that cité 
is a cherche of Seynt Stevene, 
wher he was stened to the deth. 
And therby is the Gilden Gate 
that may noght be opned. 
Thorgh that gate Crist 
entred on Palme Sonday 
on an asse, 
and that gat opned ageyn Hym. 
And yyt ben the stappes y-sene in foure places, 
which were ful of harde stones. Byfore the Cherche of the Sepulcre 200 pace is a gret hospital of Seynt John, 
of which Hospitalers hath her foundacioun. 
And for to go estward 
fro this hospital 
is a fair cherch 
which men callen Nostre Dame le Graunt. 
And also ther is a cherche 
that is called Nostre Dame de Vatyns. 
And ther Marie Cleophe 
and Marie Magdalene 
to-drow her her when Crist dayde. 
And toward the est 
at the 8 score pace 
fro the cherche of the Sepulcre 
is Templum Domini, 
that is a faire hous. 
And hit is all rounde and ryght hye, 
and hit is heelyd 
with bord and y-paved with whit marbel. 
But Sarizens wole suffre no Cristen man 
ne Jew come therynne, 
for they say that so foul men 
ne sholde come therynne in so holy place. 
But Y was therynne 
and in other places 
wher Y wolde, 
for Y hadde letters of the soudan 
with his greet seel, 
and comonly other men 
haveth but a synet. 
And whoso haveth his letter 
with his greet seel, 
he hit shal bere afore hym 
uppon a greet sper hangynge. 
And men do gret worship therto 
and knelyn doun agen hit, as we don agen Godis body. 
For to wham that hit is y-send to, 
ferst he shal encline therto, 
and thenne take hit 
on her heed, 
and thenne they kysse hit and redith hit 
enclynyng 
with greet worschip, 
and then they profre hem to do 
al the wyll of the brynger. 
And in this Templum Domini 
were y-woned 
to be canones religious, 
and they hadde an abbot to 
wham they were obedyent. 
And in this temple was Charlemayn 
when [fol. 21v] the angell brought hym prepuys of Crist 
when he was circumcised, 
and sithe Kyng Charles 
let bryng hit to Parys. 
And ye shal understande 
that this is noght the Temple 
that Salomon makyde, 
for that Temple lestid 
but a 1200 and 2 yer, 
for Titus, and Vaspasianus son, 
that was emperour of Rome, 
that byseged Jerusalem 
to destroye Jewes, 
for they slow Crist 
withoute leve of the emperour. 
When he had take that cité, 
he leyt brenne the Temple 
and cast hit adoun, 
and took alle the Jewes 
and slew of hem 1,100,000. 
And other he put in prison 
and solde of hem 30 
for oo peny, 
for they seyde they bought Crist for 30 pens. And sithe Julius Apostata 
gaf leve to the Jewes 
to make the Temple of Jeru- salem, 
for they hatid Cristen men, 
and yit they were Christen hemself, 
but they hadde forsake her feith. 
And whenne the Jewes had makyd the Temple, 
tho come an erthquake, 
as God wolde, 
and cast hit adoun. 
And sith Adrian the emperour makyd Jerusalem agen 
and the Temple 
in the same maner 
that Salomon makyd hit. 
And he wolde 
that no Jewe 
sholde dwelle ther 
but Cristen men, 
for he thoughte, 
thow they ne were Cristen men, 
they loved more Cristen men 
than eny other men, 
save men of his owen feith. 
And this Adrian let close and walle the cherche of the Holy Sepulcre 
withynne the cité — 
that byfore was withoute — and wolde have y-chaunged the name of Jerusalem 
and calle hit Animote holy: 
that name last noght longe. 
Also the Sarizyns doth gret worship 
to that Temple, 
for they seyn that place is ryght holy. 
And when they gon thiderynne, 
they goon barefoot and knelith adoun many tymes. 
And when my felawes 
and Y come thiderin, 
we dide of oure shone and come barefoot, 
in tocknynge 
that we sholde do also moche worship, other more, 
as they that were in mysbyleve. 
And this Temple is of hithe 120 
and 5 cubites 
and of wydnesse 64 cubites 
and also moch of leynthe, 
and hit is withynne 
al aboute ful of pilouris of marbel. 
And in the myddel of [fol. 22r] this Temple 
is a stage of 24 grecis of heithe 
and good pylouris aboute hit. 
This place is y-called Sancta Sanctorum, 
that is to say: 
"Holy of Halwes." 
And in that place cometh noon other 
but the prelate which that maketh her sac rifise, 
and the peple stondeth 
all aboute in stages 
as they ben of degré. 
And ther beth 4 ontrees to the Temple, 
and the dores ben of cipresse wel y- dight. 
And withynne the north dore 
is a poule of water, 
of which Holy Wryt spekith and seith thus: 
Vidi aquam egredientem de templo. 
That is to say: 
"I saw water comyng out of the Temple." 
And on that other syde 
is the huge roch 
that somtyme was called Morarche, 
but afterward hit was y-called Beleth, 
other Arke of God, 
with relikes of Jewes. This Arke let Titus lede 
with the same relikes to Rome 
when he hadde destruyed the Jewes. 
In that Arke were the 10 Commaundemens 
and som of Aarons yerd 
and of Moyses yerd, 
with the which he departyd the Rede See 
when the peple of Israel passide 
thorghout foot-dry. 
And with that yerd he smot the roch, 
and water com out of hym, 
and with that yerd he dide many wondres. 
And ther was a vessel of goold ful of manna, 
and clothyng, and ornamentes, 
and the tabernacle of Aaron, 
and other many relikes. 
And ther was a table, squar, of goold 
with 12 precious stones, 
and a beest of jasper grene 
with foure figuris, 
and 8 names of Our Lord withynne, 
and 7 candelstyckes of goold, 
and 12 pottes of goold, 
and 4 ensensures of goold, 
and an auter of goold, 
and 4 lyons of goold 
uppon which they hadde a cherubyn of goold 12 spanne long, 
and a tabernacle of goold, 
and 12 trumpes of sylver, 
and a table of sylver, 
and 8 holy loves, 
and other relikes 
that were byfore. 
And uppon that roch 
that Moyses smote, 
ther sleep Jacob when he saw angelis go up and doun by a scale, 
and seyde thus: 
Vere locus iste sanctus 
est et ego nesciebam. 
That is to say: 
"Forsothe this place is holy, 
and Y wist hit noght." [fol. 22v] 
And Jacob heilde stylle ther an angel 
and chaunged his name 
and called hym Israel. 
And in that place saw David the angel 
that smot the peple 
with a swerd 
and put hit al blody 
on the shethe. 
And in the roche 
He sette Hym 
when the Jewes wolde have y-stened Hym. 
And that roch cleff in two, 
and in that clyft He hydde Hym, 
and an angel come 
and gaf Hym lyght. 
And ther forgaf Our Lord the womman 
that was y-take in adulteri. 
And ther the angel denounced the nativité of Seynt John the Baptist. 
And ther preyde David 
to Our Lord 
and to the angel 
that He wolde have mercy 
on hym 
and of his peple. 
And Our Lord herde hym 
and his prayer. 
And therfore he wolde have makyd a temple in that place, 
but Our Lord forbed hym 
by a angel, 
for he hadde y-do treson 
when he dyde sle Urye, 
a good knyght, forto have his wiff. 
And therfore though he hadde ordeyned to make that temple, 
he lete Salomon his sone to make hit. 
And he prayed Our Lord 
that alle thilke 
that prayed in that place 
devoutly and with good herte, 
that He wolde here hyre prayere. 
And Our Lord graunted hym, 
and therfor hit was y-called Templum of Counsel 
and helpe of God. 
In that temple was Zacary i-slayn. 
And toward the south is the temple of Salamon, 
that is a greet place 
and a fair place. 
And in this place dwellen knyghtes 
that ben callid Templers, 
and that was the foundacion of hem, 
and her order is withoute the cloystre of the temple. 
Toward the north syde 
is a fayr cherche of Seynt Anne, 
Our Lady moder. 
Ther was Our Lady conceyved, 
and byfore the cherche 
is a greet tre 
that bygan to growe that same nyght. 
And ther neygh lay somtyme Seynt Anne, 
but Seynt Elene leet translate her to Constantynople. 
In that cherche is a walle 
in the maner of a cis- terne 
that is y-called probatica piscina, 
that hadde 5 entrees. 
And in that [fol. 23r] 
was woned an angel 
to descende and stere the water. 
And what man 
that ferst bathid hym therynne, 
after that steryng of that water, 
was y-makyd hool 
of alle sicknesse 
that he hadde. 
And ther was a man 
in the palasye y-helyd, 
which was syke 38 yer. 
And Crist seide thus: 
Tolle grabatum tuum et ambula. 
That is to say: 
"Take thy bed and go." 
And a lytel thenne 
was the hous of Kyng Herodes 
that let sle the Innocentes. 
This Herodes was ful wyckyd man and fel, 
for he leet ferst sle his owen wyff, 
that he loved wel. 
And for greet love that he hadde to here, 
when she was deed 
he by- held here 
and waxe out of his wytte, 
and so was he long. 
And sithen he come ageyn to hymself, 
and thenne let he sle his cheldren 
that he gat by that wyff. 
And then he let sle that other wyff 
and a sone 
that he gat on her. 
And when he saw 
that he sholde deye, 
he sente for his soster 
and alle the gret lordes of the contré, 
and let put all the gret lordes in a tour, 
and seyde to his soster he wyste well that men 
of that contré wold make no sorwe for hym 
when he wer deed. 
And therfore he leet her swer 
that she sholde let smyte of the hedes 
of all the lordes 
when he were deed, 
and then sholde al the contré make sorwe 
for his deth 
and elles noght. 
And thus makyd he his testament. 
But his sostre wolde noght ful- fille hit, 
for as sone as he was deed, 
she delyveryd alle the lordes, 
and bade hem go home 
to her owen places, 
and tolde hem what her brother wolde 
that she hadde y-do with hem. And ye shal understonde 
that ther were thre Herodes of greet name. 
This of wham Y spak now 
was y-called Ascolonyte. 
And he that lete smyte of the hede of Seynt John the Baptist was Herodes Antipa. 
And Herodes Agrippa lete sle Seynt Jame. 
Forthermore in the cité 
is the Cherche of the Saveour 
and ther is an arme of Seynt John Crisostome. 
And ther is the most partye of Seynt Steveneis heed. 
And in the other syde toward the south, 
a man may go to the Mount of 
Syon;[fol. 23v] 
ther is a fayr cherche of Seynt Jame, 
wher his hed was smyte of. 
Now go we to the Mount Syon, 
and ther is a fayr cherch of God 
and of Oure Lady, 
wher she deyde. 
And fro that place, 
she was y-bore 
with the aposteles 
to the Vale Josaphat. 
And ther is the stone 
that the angel bare to Our Lady 
fro the Mount Synay, 
and hit is 
of that colour 
of that roch of Seynt Katerin. 
Also at the entré of the Mount Syon is a chapel, 
and at that chapel 
is that greet ston, 
and hit is large, 
which that covereth the sepulcre 
when Crist was leyd ther- ynne. 
And ther is a litle pece of the pilour 
to which Our Lord was bounde 
when He was scorged. 
And ther was a hous 
that was that tyme the bysshopes of the Lawe. 
And in that same place Peter forsoke Our Lord 3. 
And ther is a partye of the table 
on which God makyd His Maundy. 
And ther apeyred Crist ferst to His disciples 
after His Uprysyng, 
when the gates were shytte, 
and seyde: Pax vobis. 
That is to sey: 
"Pees to yow." 
And on that mount apered Crist to Seynt Thomas 
and bad hym asay His woundes, 
and thenne leved he ferst, 
and seyde thus: 
Dominus meus et deus meus. 
That is to say: 
"My Lord, my God." 
In that same place, 
byhynde the hyghe auter, 
were alle the apostoles on Wit Soneday, 
when the Holy Gost descended 
on hem 
in licknes of fire. 
And ther makyd God Pasche 
with His disciples. 
And ther slept John the Evaungelist 
uppon Our Lordes kne and sey slepyng many prevy thynges of hevene. 
This Mount Syon 
is withynne the cité. 
And the cité is strengre 
on that syde than in eny other, 
for at the foot of Mount Syon 
is a fair castel and strong. 
On the Mount Syon was Kyng David and Salomon y-beryed 
and many other also. 
And a stones cast fro that castel 
is another chapel 
wher Our Lord was jugged, 
for that tyme was Cayphas hous. 
Under Mount Syon 
toward the Vale of Josaphat 
is a well 
that men callen Nata- tori Silo. 
Ther was Our Lord 
y-wassh 
when He was [fol. 24r] y-baptised. 
And ther neygh 
is the tre 
of which Judas honge hymself. 
And ther nye is the synagoge 
wher Judas caste the 30 pens 
byfore the Jewes and Fariseis 
and seyde thus: 
Peccavi tradens sanguinem justum. 
That is to say: 
"I have synwed, 
disseyved ryghtfull blood." 
And on that other syde of Mount Syon, 
toward the south a stones cast, 
is that feeld 
that was bought with tho 30 pens, 
which is y-called Acheldemak, 
that is to say the "Feeld of Blood." 
In that feeld beth many tumbes of Cristen men, 
for ther beth many pilgrymes biried. 
And also toward the west syde of Jerusalem 
is a fair cherche wher the tre grew 
of which the Cros was maked. 
And ther neygh is a cherch 
wher Our Lady mette with Elizabeth 
when they were bothe with chylde, 
and Seynt John stired 
in his moder wombe 
and dide worship to Our Lord, his makere. 
And ther was Seynt John y-bore. 
And ther neygh 
is the castel of Emaux. 
And two myle fro Jerusalem is Mount Joye, 
and that is a fayre place 
and a lykyng. 
And ther lyth Samuel 
the prophete 
in a fayr tumbe. 
And hit is called Mount Joye, 
for that may pylgrimes ferst y-se that cometh to Jerusalem. 
And in the myddel of the Vale of Josaphat 
is a lytel ryver 
that is y-called Torrens Cedron. 
And overtwert that ryver lay that tree, 
of which that Cros was maked, 
that men yede over. 
Also in that vale is a cherch of Our Lady, 
and ther is the tumbe of Our Lady. 
And Our Lady was of elde 
when she deyde 72 yer. 
And ney that is a place 
wher Judas kyssed Our Lord 
when He was y-take, 
that men callen Gessamain. 
And Crist byleved ther His disciples 
byfore His Passion, 
when he yede to praye and seyde thus: 
Pater si fieri potest transeat 
a me calix iste. 
That is to say: 
"Fader, if hit may be, 
do let this Passion go fro me." 
And ther is the tumbe of Kyng Josaphat, 
of wham the vale had his name. 
And at that oon syde of the vale is Mount Olyvete, 
and hit is called so 
for ther greweth many olyve treis. 
And hit is heyer than Jerusalem, 
and fro that hille men 
may se into the stretis of Jerusalem. [fol. 24v] 
And bytwyne 
that hille and Jerusalem 
is noght but the Vale of Josaphat, 
and hit is noght ful large. 
And on that hille stood Crist 
when He went to Hevene, 
and yit semeth ther the stappes 
of His lyft foot in the stoon. 
And ther is an abbey of blake canons 
that were somtyme dwellyng ther, 
but ther is now a cherche. 
And a lytel then is a chapel, 
in which chapel is a stoon 
on which Our Lord satte 
when He prechid to the peple 
and sayd thus: 
Beati pauperes spiritu, 
quoniam ipsorum est regnum celorum. 
That is to say: 
"Blessed be tho 
that beth poore in spirit, 
for her is the kyngdome of 
Hevene." 
And ther He taughte His disciples her Pater Noster. 
And a litel then is Besfage, 
fro whom Crist sent Petre to fecche an asse on Palme Sonday. 
And toward the est is a chapel 
that men callen Betonye; 
ther dwelled Symon lepre, 
that herborwed Our Lord 
and tho that were with Hym of His disciples. 
And he was y-called Julian, 
and he was makyd bysshop. 
And that is he 
that men callen uppon for herborgh. 
In that place God forgaff the synnes of Mari Maudeleyn, 
and ther she wasshid His feet 
with her teres of her eyen, 
and wiped hem with her here. 
And ther was Lazar arered, 
that was dede four daies. 
And ther is the place 
wher Our Lady apered to Seynt Thomas 
after her Assumpcioun, 
and she gaf to hym her gerdel. 
And ther ney is the stoon 
uppon which Our Lord sat 
and prechid many tymes; 
and theruppon shal He sitte 
on the Day of Dome, 
as Hymself sayde. 
And ther ney is the Mount of Galilé 
wher the aposteles were y-gadered 
when Mary Maudeleyn tolde hem of Cristis Rysyng. 
And bytwyne Mount Olivete and Mount Galilé 
is a chirche 
wher the angel tolde Our Lady of her deth. 
Also fro Betonye to Jerico is 5 mile. 
Jerico was somtyme a litel cité, 
but hit was destruyed 
and now is ther 
but a litel toun. 
That toun toke Josue 
by miracle of God 
and byddyng of the angel, 
and destruyed hit 
and cursyd 
alle tho 
that held hit agen. 
Of that cité was Raab, 
the comune womman, 
that receyved the messagers of Israel 
and kepte hem fro peryles. 
And therfore she hadde a good reward of God, 
for Holy [fol 25r] Writte seith thus: 
Qui accipit prophetam in nomine prophete, 
mercedem prophete accipiet. 
That is to sayn: 
"He that taketh the prophete 
in the name of the prophete, 
he shal take mede of a prophete." 
Also fro Betanye men goon to Flom Jordan 
thorgh wyldernesse, 
and hit is ney a daies journey 
estward into a greet hille, 
wher Our Lord fasted 40 dayes. 
And the devel of Helle temptid Crist 
and sayde thus: 
Dic ut lapides isti panes fiat. 
That is to say: 
"Say that thes stones ben maked bred." 
And ther is an hermytage 
in the which dwelleth a maner of freres 
that men callen Georgens, 
for Seynt George funded hem. 
And uppon that hille dwelled Abraham 
a greet while. 
Also as men goon to Jerico, 
in the way seet syke men cryynge thus: 
Jhesu, fili David, miserere mei. 
That is to seyn: 
"Jhesu, David sone, 
have mercy on me." 
And two myle fro Jerico is Flom Jordan. 
And ye shal understande 
that the Dede See 
departeth the lond of Jude and of Arabye, 
and that see lasteth 
fro Sara into Arabie. 
And that water of that see is ful better, 
and this water casteth out a thyng 
that is y-called aspaltoun, 
as greet pecis as an hors. 
And Jerusalem is 200 forlang fro this see, 
and hit is y-called the Dede See, 
for hit renneth noght; 
ne noon maner beist may leve therynne, 
and that hath ben assayed many tymes. 
And no man may drynke of that water, 
and if eny men casteth ire therynne, 
hit cometh up agen; 
and if eny men casteth fetheris therynne, 
hit sinketh adoun to gronde, 
and that is agen kynde. 
And for synne agen kynde 
was the cité loste 
that stode ther. 
And ther now grow eth trees and berith fruyt of fair colour and semeth rype, 
but thorgh venjaunce of God 
that cité was brent with fire of Helle. 
And som men callen that water the Lake of Allfetida, 
and som men callen hit the Flom of Devel, 
and som men callen hit the Flom Stynkyng. 
Ther sonke the 5 citeis all doun, 
Sodom, Gomor, Aldema, Solome, and Segor, 
for the synnes of sodomyte 
that regned on hem. 
But Segor, 
thorgh prayers of Loth, 
was y-saved a greet while, 
for hit stood uppon a hyll. 
And men may se moche ther above the water, and men may se the [fol. 25v] walles in cler wether. 
And ther dwelled Loth a greet while, 
and his doughtres makid hym dronke, 
and he delede with hem, 
for they trowed that God wolde have destruyed all the worlde, 
as He dede at Noeis flood. 
And therfore they lay 
by her fader, 
for men shold be y-bore 
of hem into the worlde. 
And if he hadde y-be noght dronke, 
he hadde noght deled with hem. 
And at the ryght syde 
of the se dwellith Lothis wiff 
in a greet stoon of salt, 
for that she lokyd ageyn 
when the cité sanke doun. 
And ye shal understande that Abraham 
had a sone 
that heit Ysaac, 
and he was circumsysed 
when he was 8 dayes olde. 
And therfore Jewes lat circumsise her cheldren 
at the elde of 8 dayes. 
And he hadde another sone 
that men called Ismael, 
and he was of 14 yer old 
when he was circumsised, 
for they were bothe circumsysed 
uppon oon day. 
And therfore the Sarasynis 
let circumsyse her cheldren 
at 14 yer. 
Also into the Dede See renneth Flom Jordan, 
and ther hit eyndith. 
And this Flom Jordan is noght a ful gret river, 
but ther is moch good fyssh therynne. 
And hit cometh 
fro the Mount Libanye 
fro 2 welles 
that men callen Jor and Dan, 
of which the flom taketh his name. 
And in that oon syde of the rever 
is the Mount of Gelboe, 
and ther is a fair playn. 
And on that other side men gon to the Mount Liban, 
and the hyll departeth the kyngdomes of Surrye 
and the contré of Phenes. 
On that hylle groweth seedes 
and that berith long apples, 
as gret as a manis hede. This Flom Jordan departeth Galilé, 
and the lond Idonye 
and the lond of Barron, 
and hit renneth 
into a playn 
that men calleth Meldane and Sermoys. 
And on that playn is the Temple Job. 
On this Flom Jordan Our Lord was baptised, 
and ther was the voys 
of the Fader y-herde seynge thus: 
Hic est filius meus dilectus 
in quo michi bene complacui ipsium audite. 
That is to say: 
"Her is My Sone that Y love, 
in wham Y am wel payd; 
herith [fol. 26r] 
Hym." 
And the Holy Gost descended uppon Hym 
in licknesse of a culver, 
and so was at His baptising the Holy Trinité. 
And thorgh the Flom Jordan 
passid the chyldren of Israel al drye, 
and they sette stones 
in the myddel of the water 
in tocknynge of a myracle. 
Also in that Flom Jordan was Naaman of Surry i-bathed, 
that was a mesel, 
and y-helyd was ther. 
And a lytel then is the cité of Hay, 
whoch Josue assayled 
and toke hit also. 
In the entré of that flom 
is the Vale Mambre, 
a fair contré and a plentouous. 
And ye shal understonde, 
for to go fro the Dede See estward out of the marche of the Londe of Promission 
is a strong castel, 
that men callen Garras other Ser- moyns, 
that is to say Ryal Mount in Frenshe. 
This castel leet a kyng of Fraunce make, 
that men callid Baudewyn, 
that hadde conquered all that londe 
and hadde y-put hit 
in hondes of Cristen men to kepe. 
And under that castel is a fayr toun 
that is y-called Sabaoth. 
Ther aboute dwelleth many Cristen men under tribute. 
And then men goth to Nazareth, 
of which Our Lord had His name. 
[ENVIRONS OF JERUSALEM.] CAPITULUM SEPTIMUM. [Chapter 7.] Fro Jerusalem to Nazareth 
is thre journeys, 
for men goth thorgh the province of Galilé, 
thorgh Ramatha and Sophym 
and by the heyghe hille of Effraym, 
wher Anna, Samuelis moder, dwelled, 
and ther Samuel the prophete y-bore. 
And then men goth to Sybole, 
wher the Ark of God 
was y-kepte 
under Elye the prophete. 
Ther makyd the peple of Ebron her sacrifise to Our Lord, 
and ther spake Our Lord to Samuel. 
And ther ney by is Gabon and Rama and Benjamyn, 
of which Holy Writ spekith. 
And then men cometh to Sychem, 
and some men callen hit Sykar. 
This is in the province of Samaritane, 
and ther was somtyme a cherche, 
but hit is cast adoun. 
And hit is a fair valey 
and a plenteuous, 
and ther is a good cité 
that men callen Neaple. 
And fro then is a journey to Jerusalem, 
and therby is the Temple Joseph, Jacobis sone, 
that was sold into Egipt, 
for out of Egipt 
were his bones 
y-brought in leed. 
And thider cometh Jewes ofte in pilgrimage [fol. 26v] 
with gret devocion. 
And therby is the cité of Carisoun, 
wher the Samaritanis maked her sacrifise. 
And ther nye is the Vale of Dotaym, 
and ther is the cisterne 
in which Joseph was y-caste. 
And hit is 2 myle fro Sykar. 
Fro then men goth to Samay, 
that is y-called Sabaste, 
which is the chyef cité 
of that contré. 
And of that cité were 12 kyndes of Israel. 
And ther was Seynt John the Baptist graved bytwixte two prophetis, Eliseus and Abdom, 
but he was byhedid 
in the castel of Makaryn 
byside the Dede See. 
And he was translated 
with his disciples 
and y-grave at Samay, 
but ther Julius Apostata leet take his bones and bren hem, 
for he was that tyme emperour. 
But that fynger, 
the which he shewed Our Lord, 
seyng thus: 
Ecce agnus dei; 
that is to say: 
"Byhold the Lombe of God"; 
that myght noght be brend, 
and Seynt Tecle the virgyne 
let bere hit into the mount, 
and ther was y-do therto greet worship. 
And ther was the hed of Seynt John the Baptiste y-closed in a wall, 
but Theodosy the emperour 
let take hit out 
and fond hit y-wrapped in a cloth al blody, 
and so he let hit bere to Constantynople. 
And so hit is yit, 
the halfendell of the hede, 
and that other halfendell is at Rome, 
in the cherche of Seynt Silvestre. 
And that vestel 
in which this hede was leed 
when hit was smyte of, 
that is at Gene, 
and men of Gene 
doth gret worship therto. 
And somme seyn that Seynt Johnis hede 
is at Amyas in Pycardy. 
And that hit sholde be Seynt Johnis hede the Baptiste, 
Y wot noght, 
but God wot. 
Fro Sabaste to Jerusalem is 12 myle. 
And bytwyne the hilles of the contré 
is a well 
that men callen Fons Jacob, 
that is to say "Jacobis 
Well," 
which changeth four tymes 
a yer his colour: 
somtyme hit is reed, 
somtyme cleir, 
somtyme thicke. 
That men that beth dwellyng therby beth i-called Samaritanis, 
and they were acounted to the aposteles. 
And her lawe varieth 
fro Cristen lawe and Sarasyns, 
fro Jewes and fro paynemus. 
And they byleveth wel on God, 
that all thyng shal deme, 
and they leve the Byble after the letter. 
And they wrappeth [fol. 27r] 
her hedes in reed lynnen cloth 
for difference of other, 
for Sarasyns wrappen her hedes 
in whit lynnen cloth, 
and Cristen men that dwelleth ther in blew cloth 
other blak cloth, 
and Jewes in yelw cloth. 
In this contré dwelleth many Jewes paynge tribute, 
as Cristen men doth. 
And if ye wole y-wyte the letteris of Jewes, 
they beth soche. 
And thes beth the names of her letters, 
as they callen hem: alphaA, bethB, gimelC, heD, vauE, yauF, exG, iothH, karrykK, lempL, meuM, mM, enN, samethO, elyP, pheO, ladR, sothS, firT, sounU, tauX, loccirsY. 
Now shal ye have the figures. . . . 
And fro this contré 
that Y spak of, 
men goth to the playn of Galilé and leveth the hille 
in that on syde. 
Galilé is of the province 
and of the Land of Promission. 
And in that province is the lond of Nayme and Capharnaum and Corysaym and Bethsayda. 
And in Bethsayda was Seynt Peter and Seynt Andrew y-bore. 
And of Corisaym shal Antecrist come 
and ther y-bore, 
as som men sayn. 
And som men sayn he shal be bore in Babiloyn. 
And therfor seith the prophecie thus: 
De Babilonia columba exiet que totum mundum devorabit. 
That is to say: 
"Of Babyloyn shal a colver come 
out 
that shal devoure al the worlde." 
And this Antecrist shal be norshed in Bethsaida, 
and he shal regne in Corysaym. 
And therfore Holy Wryt seith thus: 
Ve tibi Corisan. 
Ve tibi Bethsayda. 
Ve tibi Capharum. 
That is to say: 
"Wo be to thee Corysaym! 
Wo be to thee Bethsayda!" 
And the Cane of Galilé 
also is 4 myle fro Nazareth. 
And of that cité 
was the womman Cananee 
of wham the gospel spekith. 
And ther Our Lord shewed His ferst miracle 
at the feste of Architriclyne, 
when He turned water into wyne at Galilé. 
And fro thenne men goth to Nazareth, 
that was somtyme a gret cité 
but now hit is a lytel toun, 
and hit is noght walled. 
And ther was Our Lady bore, 
but she was y- gete at Jerusalem. 
At Nazareth, Joseph toke Our Lady 
to wyve 
when she was of 14 yer olde. 
And ther the angel salved her, 
when he seyde thus: 
Ave Maria, 
gratia plena dominus tecum. 
That is to say: 
"Hayl be thow, 
[fol. 27v] Mary, 
ful of grace; 
God is with 
thee." 
And ther was somtyme a greet cherch, 
and now is ther 
but a litel closet 
to receyve the offryng of pilgrimes. 
And ther is Gabrielis well, 
wher Our Lord was woned 
to be bathed 
when He was litel. 
At Nazareth was Our Lord norshed. 
For Nazareth is to say "flour of 
gardeyn," 
and hit may wel be called so, 
for ther was noryshid 
the flour of lyff 
that was Jhesu Crist. 
And half a myle fro Nazareth 
is the blood of Our Lord, 
for the Jewes lad Hym 
uppon an highe roch 
to cast Hym doun 
to sle Hym. 
But Jhesu Crist passed fro hem and vanshide away, 
and uppon that roch 
beth His stappes yit y-sene. 
And som men sayn, when they beth agast of theves other of enemyes, 
on this maner: 
Jhesu autem transiens 
per medium illorum ibat. 
Irruat super eos formido, 
et cetera. 
Fiant immobiles, 
et cetera. 
And ye shal understonde 
that Our Lady had chelde 
when she was 15 yer olde, 
and she dwelled with Hym 32 yer and 3 monthes, 
and after His Passion she leved 24 yer. 
And fro Nazareth to Mount Tabor is 3 myle, 
and ther Our Lord transfigured Hym 
byfore Seynt Petre, Seynt John, and Seynt Jame. 
And ther sey they Crist in His Godhede and Moyses and Hely the prophete. 
And tho seyde Seynt Petre 
in this wyse: 
Bonum est hic esse. 
Faciamus tria tabernacula. 
And hit is to say: 
"Hit is good to be her, 
make we 3 tabernacles." 
And Crist bade hem sey hit to no man, 
unto the tyme that He were arise 
fro deth to lyve. 
And uppon the same hylle 
shal foure angels blowe trompes 
and arere alle men and wymmen 
that haveth y-be, 
and beth, 
and shal be, 
fro deth to lyve, 
and they shal come in body 
and soule to the Dome. 
But the Dome shal be gyve in the Vale of Josaphat uppon Pasch day, 
in such tyme as Our Lord roos fram deth to lyve. 
Also a myle fro Tabor 
is the Mount Ermon, 
and ther was the cité of Naym. 
Byfore the gates of the cité, 
Our Lord arered the wyduwe sone, 
which had no mo cheldren. 
And fro thenne men goth 
to [fol. 28r] the cité of Tybourne, 
that is uppon the See of Galilé. 
And thow hit be called a see, 
yit hit is no see, 
nother noon arme of the see, 
for hit is a broke of fressh water. 
And hit is of leyngthe 
ney an 100 forlonge and 40 of brede, 
and therynne is moch good fissh. 
And uppon that same see, 
Our Lord yede drie foot. 
Ther He seyde to Peter, 
when He yede on the water 
and was neygh sonke: 
Modice fidei quare dubutasti. 
That is to say: 
"Thou of litel feith, 
whi hast thou doute?" 
In this cité of Tibourne 
is that table 
that Crist eete upon 
with His disciples 
after His Resurexion. 
Of which risyng Holy Writ seyth thus: 
Et cognoverunt eum 
in frac tione panis. 
That is to say: "And ther they knew Hym in brekyng of 
breed." 
And ye shal understande that Flom Jordan 
bygynneth 
under the hille of Lyban, 
and ther bygynneth the Lond of Promission, 
and hit lasteth to Bersabee 
in leyngthe to the south and north. 
And in brede, 
hit is neye 180 myle. 
And amonge the Sarasens 
in many places 
dwelleth many Cristen men under tribute. 
And they beth of diverse maners, 
and ther beth diverse maneris of monkes, 
and they beth all Cristned 
and haveth divers lawes, 
but they all byleveth 
on God the Fader, Sone, and Holy Goost. 
And yit they diverseth 
in her articles of our feith. 
And they ben called Jacobynes, 
for Seynt Jame converted hem. 
And Seynt John Baptist baptised hem. 
And they seyn that men sholde shryve hem to God 
and noght to man. 
For they seyn that God bad noght 
a man 
shryve hem to another. 
For David seith thus: 
Confiteor tibi domine 
in toto corde meo. 
That is to say: 
"Lord, y-shryve me to Thee 
in al my herte." 
And in another place, David seith thus: 
Delictum meum cognitum tibi feci. 
That is to say: 
"My trespas Y have maked knowen to Thee." 
And in another place, David seith: 
Deus meus es tu et confitebor tibi. 
That is to say: 
"Thou art my God 
and Y shal shryve me to Thee." 
And in another place, David seith: 
Quoniam cogitacio hominis confitebitur tibi. 
That is to say: 
"Forwhy a mannes thoght shal [fol. 28v] 
be shreve to Thee." 
And they conne wel the Byble 
and the Sauter book, 
but they alegge hit noght in Latyn 
but in her owen langage. 
Therfor Seynt Austyn and Seynt Gregore seyth thus: 
Qui scelera sua cogitat et conversus fuerit, 
veniam sibi credat. That is to say: "Who that knoweth his synne 
and is y-turnd, 
he may hope to heve forgefnesse." 
And Seynt Gregore seith thus: 
Dominus pocius mentem quam verba considerat. 
That is to say: 
"Our Lord taketh more kepe to thoght than to word." 
And Hillary seith thus: 
Longorum temporum crimina 
in ictu oculi perient 
si corde fuerit nata contempcio. 
That is to say: 
"Synnes that ben of long tyme shal pershe in twynclyng of an eye, 
if the despisyng of hem be y-bore of a mannes herte." 
And thus they sey that men sholde shryve hem to God by His owen

And this was the shrift 
in the ferste tyme, 
but Seint Peter 
and the aposteles and popes 
which come sithe haveth ordeyned 
that men shul ben shryve to prestes, 
men as hy beth. 
And for this skyle: 
for they sey that to a man 
that hath a sicknesse, 
men may geve no good medicyne 
but they knowe the kynde of the sicknes, 
and so they sey that men 
may geve no convenable penaunce 
but they know the synne. 
And ther beth other men

which Seynt George con- verted, 
and they doth more worship 
to seyntes of Hevene 
than other men doth. 
And they alle haven her crones y-shave, 
and the clerkes haveth roonde crones 
and lewed men square crones. 
And they hold the lawe of Grekis. 
And other men beth ther

for they were gerdeles under. 
And ther beth many that beth called Nideus, 
and everich of ham hath som article of our feith, 
but everich varieth fram other. 
And of her variaunce hit 
were moche to telle, 
for ther beth many wonderfull kyndes among hem. 
A WAY FRO GALILÉ TO JERUSALEM THORGH DAMAS. 
CAPITULUM OCTAVUM. [Chapter 8.] [fol. 29r] 
Now sithe Y have told of many maners of men 
that dwelleth in diverse contreis, 
now Y shal telle, 
who so wole turne 
fro the lond of Galilé, 
that Y spake of eer, 
he shal go another way thorgh Damas, 
that is a fair cité 
and full of good, 
and ther is plenté of marchaundise. 
And hit is 3 journeis 
fro the see 
and 5 journeis fro Jeru- salem. 
But they carieth her marchaundise 
uppon camels, mules, hors, and drom- edaries, 
and other maner of beistis. This cité founded Ebreus Damask, 
that was Abrahamis servant 
byfore that Josias was y-bore; 
and he hoped to be Abrahamis eyr, 
and therfor he called that cité 
after his name Damas. 
In that place Caym slow his brother Abel. 
And byside Damas is the Mount Syrie. 
In that cité beth many fucissions 
to save mennes bodies. 
And Seynt Poul was a fisician 
to hele hem bifore 
that he was converted, 
and sithe he was ficissian of mannes soules. 
And Seynt Luke was his disciple 
to lerne fusike, 
and many other men. 
And fro Damas men cometh by a place 
that men calleth Nostre Dame de Sarmany, 
the which is cleped Gardmarch, 
that is 5 myle fro Damas. 
And hit is uppon a roch, 
and ther is a fair cherch, 
and ther dwelleth monkes and nonnes, 
the which beth Cristen. 
In that cherche byhynde the highe auter 
in the wall is a table of tre. 
In the which wall is an ymage of Our Lady 
was y-peynted, 
that many tymes turneth into flessh. 
But that ymage is now y-sey 
but a lytel, 
but evermore, 
thorgh the grace of God, 
that ymage droppeth oyle, 
as hit were oyle of olyve. 
And ther is a vestel of marbel 
that receyveth that oyle, 
and they hit geveth to pilgrimes, 
for hit helith hem of many sicknesses. 
And if hit be y-kept clene all the yer, 
at the yeres eynde, 
hit turneth into flessh and blood. 
Bytwyne the cité of Sark 
and the cité of Raphane 
is a rever 
that is y-called Zabatoriye, 
for on the Saturday hit renneth faste 
and al the wyke 
els hit stondeth stille 
and renneth noght, 
other els lyte. 
And ther is another ryver 
that on the nyght hit fresith [fol. 29v] fast, 
and on the day no forst is sene. 
And so men goth by a cité 
that is y-called Beruch, 
and ther men entreth into the see 
that shal go to Cipre. 
And they areveth at port de Sure of Tyri 
and then to Cipre. 
Other men goth fro the port to Tyri right 
and cometh noght to Cipre, 
and then he shal aryve 
at som haven in Grece, 
and so come to this contré 
by wayes 
of which Y have tolde byfore. 
THE SHORTEST WAY TO JERUSALEM. 
CAPITULUM NONUM. [Chapter 9.] Now Y have told the way lengest and ferrist 
by which men may go to Baby- loyne, Mount Synay, 
and many other, 
and to the Lond of Promission. 
Now Y wole telle the ryght way 
and shortest to Jerusalem. 
For som men wole noght passe hit 
for the defaute of costages, 
and som men for the defaute of companye, 
and many other causes. 
And therfore Y shal telle shortly 
how a man may go 
with litel costage 
and short tyme. 
A man that cometh fro the west, 
as Ingelond, 
he that goth thorgh France, 
Bur- goyne, Lumbardy, and so to Venyse other to Gene, 
other to som other haven of that marches, 
and entreth into a shyppe 
and goth 
by see 
to the ile of Griff, 
and so ryveth in Grece, 
other at Port Murrok, other Valone, other Duras, 
other at som other haven, 
and goth to londe 
and resteth hym. 
And then goth agen to see 
and ryveth in Cipre, 
and come noght 
into the ile of Rodes, 
and aryveth at Famagost, 
that is the chif haven of Cipre, 
other ellis at Lamaton. 
And then entre into the shippe ageyn 
and passeth 
bysyde the haven of Tyre and come noght to londe. 
And so he passeth 
by alle the havenes of the costes 
tylle he come to Jafphe, 
that is the ney haven to Jerusalem, 
for hit is 27 myle bytwyne. 
And so fro Japhe men goth to the cité of Rames, 
and that is but a lytel thenne, 
and hit is a fair cité. 
And bysyde that cité 
is a cherch of Our Lady, 
wher Our Lord shewed Hym 
to her 
in thre licknes, 
the which bytockneth the Trinité. 
And ther neye is a cherch of George, 
wher his hed was y-smyte of. 
And then men goth to the castel of Chynay 
and then to the Mount Joye. 
And fro [fol. 30r] thenne, 
pylgrimes may ferst se to Jerusalem, 
and then to the Mount Madyn 
and then forth the way to Jerusalem. 
ANOTHER WAY TO JERUSALEM. 
CAPITULUM DECIMUM. [Chapter 10.] 
For as moche as meny men mowe noght 
suffre the savour of the see 
but is lever to go by londe, 
thow hit be more peyne, 
a man shal go to oon 
of thes havenes of Lombardy, 
as Venyse other another. 
And he passe to Grece, 
other to Port Marrok other another, 
and he shal go to Constantynople. 
And then he shal passe the water 
that is called the Bras of Seynt Jorge, 
and that is an arme of the see. 
And fro thenne he shal go forth to Pylverall, 
and so to the castel of Synople, 
and so to Capados, 
which is a greet contré, 
and ther beth many gret hilles. 
And he shal go thorgh Torkye 
and to the cité of Nyke, 
the which they wonne 
fro the emperour of Constan tynople. 
And hit is a fair cité 
and wel y-walled. 
And ther is a ryver that men callen the Lay. 
And ther men goth by the alpes of Morraunt, 
and by the valeys of Molbryn or, 
and by valeys of Ernax 
and so to Aunteoch the Betre, 
that sitteth on the ryght honde. 
Ther aboute beth many goode hilles 
and many fair wodes and wilde beestes. 
And he that wole go another way, 
he shal go by the playnes of Romayn, 
costande by the Romayn See. 
On that coost is a fayr castel, 
that men called Florach. 
And when a man is out of these hilles, 
he passeth thorgh Marrock and Artoys, 
wher is a greet brygge 
over the rever of Ferne, 
that men callen Fasser. 
And bysyde the cité of Damas 
is a ryver 
that men callen Albane. 
At the passage of this ryver, 
Seynt Eustace lost his two sones 
when he hadde lost his wyff. 
And hit goth thorgh the playn of Archades 
and so to the Reed See. 
And som men goth to the cité of Phenne, 
and so to the cité of Ferne. 
And thenne to Aunteoch, 
and hit is a fair cité 
and well y-walled. 
For hit is two myle longe at eche pylour. 
And ther is a brygge, 
and at ech [fol. 30v] 
pyler of the brygge 
is a fair tour. 
This cité is the beste 
that is in the kyngdome of Surri. 
Fro Aunteoch men shal go 
to the cité of Lacuth, 
and so to the cité of Gelboe, 
and so to Turtouse. 
And therby is the londe of Chaumbre, 
and ther is a strong castel 
that is y-called Maubek. 
And fro Turtouse men goth to Triple on the see, 
and so to Vacres. 
And ther beth two weyes to Jerusalem. 
On the lyft syde men goth thus to Damas by Flom Jordan. 
And on the ryght syde men goth thorgh the lond of Flagme, 
and so to the cité Cayphas, 
of which Cayphas was lord, 
and som men callen hit the castel of Pyllerynes. 
And fro thens 
is 4 dayes jorneis to Jerusalem, 
for to go thorgh Sesarye Philippum 
and Japhe 
and Rames and Emaux, 
and so to Jerusalem. 
A WEY ALL BY LOND TO JERUSALEM. 
CAPITULUM UNDECIMUM. [Chapter 11.] 
Now have Y tolde yow som weyes by londe and watres 
how men may go to Jeru- salem. 
And thogh hit be so that ther beth many other weyes 
that men may go by, 
after the contreis 
that men cometh fro, 
and at the laste they cometh to oon eynde. 
And yit ther is a wey all by londe to Jerusalem, 
and pass no see out of France other Flandres. 
But that wey is ful longe 
and perelous of gret travel, 
and therfore men goth 
by that wey ful fewe. 
And he that wole go 
by that wey, 
he shal go thorgh Al- mayne, Spruse, 
and so to Tartaryse. 
This Tartarie is y-holde 
of the gret Cane, 
of wham Y shal speke afterward, 
for thider last his lordship, 
and the lord of Tartarye 
payeth tribute to hym. 
This is a ful wicked lond, 
and a ful sondy londe, 
and lytel fruyt-beryng therynne. 
For ther grow- eth but lytel corne, 
ne benes, 
ne wyne, ne pesyn, 
but bestes beth ther gret plenté. 
And therfor they etith 
but flessh withoute brede, 
and they soupeth the broth, 
and they drynketh mylk 
of all maner bestes. 
And thei etyth cattes, ratons, and meese, 
and all maner wylde bestes. 
And they haveth litel wode, 
for they make her mete 
with hors mocke [fol 31r] 
and of other bestes y-dryed. 
Princes and other lordes 
etith but ones uppon a day and ryght litel. 
And they beth foul peple 
and of yvel kynde. 
In somer ther beth many stormes and thondres 
that sleith moch folk and bestes, 
and hit cometh sodeynly. 
Ther is gret colde 
and as sodeynly gret hete. 
The prince that governeth that lond is called Raco, 
and he dwelleth 
at the cité of Orda. 
And forsothe ther wole no good man dwelle, 
for hit is good to sowe neteles 
and other wedys, 
but other good non, 
as Y have herd say — for Y was never ther. 
But Y was in londes 
that marcheth therto, 
as the londe of Rossye, Nyvelond, 
the kyngdome of Crokowe, Lettow, 
and the kyngdom of Grasten, 
and many other places. 
But Y went never that way to Jerusalem, 
for Y have understonde 
that men may noght go 
wel that way 
but in wynter, 
for water and marys 
that beth ther, 
whiche men may noght passe, 
but yf they have forst right hard 
and that hit be snow above. 
For were noght the snow, 
ther myght no man go. 
And ye shal understonde 
that a man shal go thre journeis 
fro Pruys to passe this way, 
tyl he come to the lond of Sarasyns 
that men dwelleth ynne. 
And thow hit be 
so that Cristen men passe eche yer ther forth, 
they caryeth with hem vitayles, 
for they shal fynde noon there, 
but a maner of thyng 
that is y-called skleys. 
And they make her cariage uppon dreys. 
And as longe as her vitayles lasteth, 
they mowe dwelle ther, 
but no lenger. 
But when the spyes of the contré seith 
that Cristen men cometh, 
they renneth to toune and crieth loude, "Kerra, Kerra!" 
And also sone as they kepith hem, 
they do hem vylonye. 
And ye shal understonde 
that hit 
is hatter ther than here, 
and also colder. 
And therfor every man hath a styve in his hous, 
and therynne he eetyth 
and drynketh 
and doth what hym lyketh. 
For that londe is 
at the north syde of the worlde, 
which comenly is coldest. 
The sonne cometh noght ther, 
ne shyneth but litel. 
And that lond in som place 
is so cold 
that ther may no man dwelle ther. [fol. 31v] 
And at the south syde of the worlde, 
in som place hit is so hoot 
that ther may no man dwelle, 
for the sonne geveth 
so gret hete in the contrees. 
TRUTHE OF SARASYNS. 
CAPITULUM DUODECIMUM. [Chapter 12.] 
For as moch as Y tolde of Sarasyns 
and of her londes, 
yf ye wole Y shal yow telle 
a party of her lawes 
and of her faith, 
as her book telleth, 
which is called Akkaron. 
And som men calleth hit the book Mesap, 
and som Arne, 
in dyverse maner of langage. 
The whiche book Macamete gaf to hem, 
in which he wrote, 
among other thynges, 
as Y have seen and radde many tymes, 
and hit saith that a man 
that is good shal go to Paradys, 
and a man that is wycked 
shal go to Helle - 
and that byleveth all the Sarasyns. 
And if a man aske what thyng Paradys is, 
they speke and seyn hit 
is a place ful of delytes, 
wher a man shal fynde all maner of fruytes of the yer, 
and ryvers rennyng with mylk and hony 
and wyne and fressh water. 
And they shal have ther fair houses, 
as they have deserved. 
And thilke houses beth y-maked of precious stones, goolde, and selver. 
And ech man shal have 10 wyves, 
all maydens, 
and he shal lygge by hem, 
and they shal ever be maydens, 
and so they byleveth. 
And they speketh ofte of the Virgyne Marye 
and of the Incarnacioun 
that Mary was lerid of an angel. 
And that Gabriel seyde to her 
that she was chose 
of alle other 
fro the bygynnynge of the world, 
and that witnesseth her book Ackaron, 
and that Gabriel tolde to her 
of the Incarnacion of Jhesu Crist, 
and that she conceyved 
and bare a child 
and was mayde afterward. 
And they seyde that Jhesu Crist 
spake as sone as He was bore, 
and that He was a very prophete in word, 
in dede: 
meke and ryghtwys to all men, 
and withoute vice. 
And they sey when the angel told her of the Incarnacion, 
that she hadde gret drede, 
for she was yonge. 
And ther was oon 
in that contré 
that delid with sorceryes 
that was called Tabina, 
which with enchauntement coude make hymself lyke 
to [fol. 32r] an angel, 
and he lay ofte tymes with maydens. 
And therfore Mari 
was aferde of the angel, 
for she wende hit had y-be Tabina. 
And she conjured the angel 
and bade hym say 
if he were Tabina. 
And the angel bade her 
that she sholde have no drede, 
for he was very messager of God. 
And also her book seith 
that she hadde child 
under a palme tre, 
and therfore she was ashamed, 
and gradde, 
and seyde 
that she wolde be dede. 
And so anoon 
that childe spak and seyde: 
Ne timeas Maria. 
That is to say: 
"Have no drede, Marie." 
And in many other places speketh her book 
Ackaron 
that Jhesu Crist 
spak also sone as He was born. 
And that book telleth that Jhesu Crist 
was God Almyghty 
to be en- sample to all men, 
and that God shal deme all men, 
the goode to Hevene 
and the wicked to Helle. 
And that Jhesu Crist 
was the beste prophete 
that ever was, 
and that He was verry prophete, 
which gaf sight to the blynde 
and heled mesalles, 
and reysed dede men, 
and yede all quyke to Hevene. 
And if they may fynde a book of gospelles, 
namely with Missus est angelus Gabriel, 
they do hit gret worship; 
and fast- eth oon monthe in that yer, 
and they eten but on the nyght, 
and then they kepeth hem fro her wyves. 
But they that beth sike, 
they beth noght constrayned to that fast. 
And that book speketh of Jewes 
and seith 
that they beth wickid folke, 
for they wole noght byleve 
that Jhesu Crist is God. 
And they seith that Jewes 
lieth on Our Lady 
and on her Sone Jhesu, 
seynge that they dede Hym noght on the Cros. 
And for Sarasyns byleveth 
so neygh our fay, 
they beth lightly converted 
when men telle hem the lawe of Crist. 
And they seth they wyteth well 
by her prophecies 
that the lawe of Machamete 
shal be destrued and faile 
as doth the lawe of Jewes, 
and that Cristen lawe shal laste 
unto the worldes eynde. 
And if a man aske 
wher ynne thei byleve, 
they sey thus: 
how thei byleve in God, 
maker of Hevene 
and of erthe 
and of all other thynges, 
and withoute Hym is nothyng y-do, 
and in the [fol. 32v] Day of Dome, 
when ech man shal be demed 
after his deservyng, 
and that al thyng is sooth 
that Crist seyde 
by the mouth of the prophetes. Also Macamete bade in his Ackaron 
that ech man shold have 2 wyves, other 3, other 4, 
but now they have 9, 
and as meny lemmans 
as they like. 
And if any of her wyves do amys 
to her hosebondes, 
he may put her out of his hous 
and take another, 
but hym byhoveth 
to geve her som of his godes. 
Also when men spekith of the Fader, Sone, and Holy Gost, 
they sey tho beth 3 persons 
and noght oo God, 
for her Ackaron spekith noght therof, 
for he toucheth noght of the Trinité. And they sey that God spake, 
and elles He was dombe; 
and that He hath a gost, 
other elles He were noght on lyve. 
And they sey that Moyses and Abraham were wel with God, 
for they speke with Hym. 
And they say also that Macamete was ryght messager of God. 
And they have many good articles of our fay, 
and they knowe moche of Holy Wrytte. 
For tho that beth understondyng of Scripture and of prophecies, 
all they hem wryteth 
in her owen langage. 
But they hit understonde noght, 
but after the lettre and noght gostly. 
And therfore Seynt Poul seith thus: 
Littera occidit, spiritus autem vivificat. 
That is to say: 
"The lettre sleeth 
and the gost maketh quyke." 
And the Sarasens seith 
that Jewes beth wicked, 
for they kepe noght her lawe 
that Moyses toke hem; 
also Cristen men beth wicked peple, 
for they kepe noght the 10 Commaundementz 
that Jhesu Crist sende to hem. 
And therfore Y shal telle yow a tale. 
Y was with the soudan 
in his chambre uppon a day, 
and he lete voyde the chambre of all maner men, 
for he seide 
that he wolde speke with me in counseil. 
And he asked of me 
how Cristen men hem governed in her contré. 
And Y seyde, 
"Ryght well, 
thanked be God." 
And he seyde, "Sikerly, nay, 
for youre prestes maketh no force of Godis servise. 
For they sholde geve ensaumple to men to do well, 
and they gyve wickid ensaumple. 
And when [fol. 33r] youre peple sholde go to holy cherche 
on the holy day to serve God, 
they go to taverne and to marchaundyse, 
and lyve in glotonye and covetyse day and nyght, 
and ete and drynke as bestes that wyte noght 
when they have ynow. 
Also Cristen 
men," he seyde, 
"enforseth hem to fighte togedres 
and ech to bygyle other. 
Also," he seyde, 
"they beth so prout 
that they wyte noght 
what thei may werth: 
now longe clothes, now short clothes, 
now strait clothes, 
now wyde clothes. 
"And they sholde be 
symple," he seyde, 
"and meke and trywe, 
and do almes dede as Jhesu dyde, 
in wham they byleveth. 
And they beth so 
covetous," he seyde, 
"that for a lytel sylver, 
they wole selle wiff 
and childe and sostre. 
And a man take another mannes wyf, and no man holdeth 
wel his feith to other. 
And for her owen 
synnes," he seyde, 
"hath Cristen men lost 
al the lond 
the which that we holdeth, 
and for youre synnes 
hath your God 
gyve these londes to us, 
and noght thorgh oure streyngthe. 
For we wyte 
well," he seyde, 
"when ye serveth well your God, 
that He wole helpe yow, 
so that no man shal do ageyn yow. 
And ye wyte well 
by youre prophecies 
that Cristen men 
shal wynne agen thes londes, 
when they serveth wel her God. 
But while they lyven so yvel as they doon, we have no drede of hem, 
for her God wole noght help hem." 
And then Y asked of hym 
how he wiste the state of Cristen men so well. 
And he seyde he knew hit ful well, 
bothe of comens and of lordes 
by his messagers, 
whiche he sende thorgh all londes, 
as they were marchauntes 
with precious stones and other marchaundises, 
to knowe the maner of every lond. 
And thenne he leet calle agen all the lordes 
into his chambre. 
And thenne he shewed to me foure 
that were gret lordes 
in that contré, 
the which devised my contré 
and other contreis of Cristendom, 
as they had be men 
of that same contré. 
And they spak Frenssh ryght wel 
and the soudan also. 
And than had Y gret mervayll 
of that sclaundre of Cristen men. 
For they that sholde be turned 
by our good techyng 
and ensample uppon Cristen feithe, 
be withdrawe thorgh oure yvel ensample of lyvenge. 
And therfore [fol. 33v] hit is no wonder 
that they callen us wicked men. 
But the Sarasyns beth trywe, 
for they kepe truly the comaundementz of her Ackaron. 
And ye shal understonde 
that Machamete was y-bore in Arabye, 
and he was ferst a poore man 
and kepid hors 
and ran after marchauntz. 
And so he cam into Egipt with marchauntz, 
and Egipt was that tyme Cristen. 
And ther was a chapel 
neygh Arabye 
and ther was an heremyte. 
And when he com to the chapel 
that was but a litell hous and lowe, 
the entré bygan 
to be as gret 
as a gate of a paleys. 
And that was the ferst mervayle 
that Machamete byfell in his youthe. 
Then after bygan Machamete 
to be ryche and wys, 
and he was a gret aster- laberer. 
And sithe he was keper 
of the lond of the prins Coradan, 
and he governed hit ful wisly 
in soch maner 
that when the prins was dede, 
he weddid the lady, 
which men called Quardrich. 
And Machamete hadde ful ofte the fallyng yvell, 
wherfore the lady was wroth 
that she hadde y-take hym 
to her lord. 
But he makyde her to understonde 
that ech tyme that he fyll, 
so the angel Gabriel spak to hym 
and for the gret bryghtnes of hym 
he fyll adoun. 
This Machamete regned in Arabye the yer of Our Lord 600 and 20 yer. 
And he was of the kynde of Ysmael, 
that was Abrahamis sone, 
which that he gat of Agar his chamberer. 
And therfor som Sarasyns beth called Ysmaelites, 
and som Agariens of Agar. 
And other beth called properly Sarasyns of Sara, 
and som beth called Moabites, 
and som beth called Amonites 
after two sones of Loth. 
And so Machamete loved well a good man, 
an hermyte, 
that dwelled in wildernysse 
a myle fro the mount of Synay 
in the way 
as men goth fro Arabye to Galdé and Indee, 
a dayes journe fro the see wher marchauntes of Venyse cometh. 
And Machamete wende so ofte 
to that hermyte 
that all his men were wroth with hym. 
For he herde gladly 
that heremite preche, 
and he leet all his men walke that nyght. 
And his men thoughte 
that they wold 
that this heremyte wer dede. 
So hit byfell 
uppon a nyght 
that Machamete was ful dronke [fol. 34r] of good wyne, 
and he fyl on slepe. 
And his men toke his owne swerde 
out of his shethe, 
whiles that he slepe, 
and slow the heremyte. 
And then they put up his swerd al blody. And on the morwe, 
when he fond the heremyte dede, 
he was ful wroth 
and wold have y-do his men to deth. 
But they seyde, 
all with oon assent, 
that he hymself slow hym 
when he was dronke, 
and they shewed hym 
his swerd al blody. 
And then he leved hem 
that they seyde soth. 
And then he cursed wyn 
and all tho that drynketh wyn. 
But som drynketh hit prevely; 
and if he drynke hit openly, 
he shal be repreved. 
But they drynk good beverage 
and swet and noryshynge, 
which is makid of calamele, 
of that is sugre y- maked. 
Also hit falleth somtyme that Cristen men 
bycometh Sarasyns, 
other for povert 
other som other skyll. 
And therfore Larchesleven, 
that is receyvour of Cristen men, 
when he receyveth hem, 
he seith thus: 
Ra elles ella Machamete reozes alla. 
That is to say: 
"Ther is no God but on, 
and Machamete his 
messager." 
And sith Y have told yow 
a party of her lawe 
and her customes, 
now shal Y say of her lettres, 
which Y have, 
with her names 
and her maner of figuris, 
what they beth: almeiA, bethathB, chathiC, ephotiC, delphoyD, fothiF, garaphiG, hochymH, iocchiI, kauthiK, lothymL, malachM, nahabotN, orthiO, pozirP., zothʒ, ruchelatR, salachiS, tathimusT, urthonU, axgrosX, yrthoyY, azotchiZ, iotipyn+, zechetus9. 
Thes beth the letters, 
now shal Y telle the figures. . . 
And they have in her langage mo lettres than we have, 
for as moche as they speketh in her throtes. 
And we have in our langage two lettres 
in Englyssh mo 
than they have in her ABC, 
that is to wyte þ and ʒ, 
that men calleth thorn and yogh. 
DYVERSETEIS OF PEPLE AND OF CONTREIS. 
CAPITULUM TERCIUMDECIMUM. [Chapter 13.] 
And sithen Y have devysed 
byfor the Holy Londe 
and contrees ther aboute, 
and many weyes 
and to the Mount 
Synay,[fol. 34v] 
and to Babyloyne, 
and other places, 
now wole Y telle of yles 
and dyverse peple and bestes. 
For ther beth many diverse peple and bestes and contrees, 
which beth departed 
by the foure flodes 
that cometh out of Paradys Terrestre. 
For Mesopotanye 
and the kyngdom of Caldé and Arabye beth 
bytwyne the flodes of Tygre and Eufrates. 
And also the kyngdom of Mody 
and of Perce beth 
bytwyne the flode of Tygre and Nyle. The kyngdome of Syrri and Palastyn and Fimes beth bytwyne Eufrates and the See Metterane, 
and hit is of leyngthe 
fro Marrok to the see of Spayne 
and into the Greet See, 
and so lasteth hit byyonde Constantynople, 
43 myle of Lombardye 
into the Gret See, Occian. 
And ye shal understande 
that in the contré beth many iles and londes, 
of which hit were moche to telle all. 
But som Y shal speke. 
For he that wole go to Tartarye, 
other Perce, other Caldee, other Inde, 
he shal entre into the see 
at Gene, other Venyse, 
other at another havene by that coste, 
and so passe the see 
and aryve at Trapasond, 
that is a good cité 
that was somtyme called Le Port de Pounce. 
And ther is the kyng of Percens and Medoyns 
and also of many other marches. 
In this cité lith Attonas, 
that was bysshop of Elisaundre 
that makide the psalme Quicumque vult. 
This man was a gret doctour 
and mayster of dyvinité, 
for he spak so deep in divinité 
and of the Godhede, 
he was accused 
to the pope of Rome 
that he was an herityk — 
that was his heresie, 
for that was his feith. 
And when the pope saw that, 
he seyde that therynne 
was all our feith. 
He leit delyver hym anoon out of prison. 
And the pope commaunded that psalme to be seyd every day 
at prime and helde Atthonas a good Cristen man. 
But he wolde never go 
to his bysshoprych agen, 
for they accused hym of heresye. 
Trapasond was somtyme y-holde 
of the emperour of Constantynople, 
but a gret man 
that he send to kepe hit ageyn the Turkes 
held hit hymself 
and [fol. 35r] called hym emperour of Trapasond. And fro then men goth to Litel Admonye. 
In that contré is an olde castel 
that is uppon a roch 
that is y-called the castel of Sperver. 
And ther men fyndeth an hauke 
on a perche sittyng right wel y-maked, 
and a fair lady of fayre kepeth that hauke. 
And he that wole wake this hauke 7 dayes and 7 nyght 
(and som seith 3 dayes and 3 nyght) 
alone withoute companye and withoute slepe, 
this fayre lady shal come to hym 
at 7 dayes 
(other the 3 dayes) eynde, 
and she wole graunte hym the ferst thyng 
that he wole aske of worldly thyng. 
For hit hath y-be ofte asayed and y-preved. 
And somtyme hit fill 
that a kyng of Ermonye, 
that was a doughty man, 
waked on a tyme this hauke. 
And at the 7 dayes ende, 
the lady com to hym and bade aske, 
for he hadde wel y-do his dever. 
And the kyng sayde 
that he was a gret lorde 
and in good pees and rych ynow, 
so that he wolde aske nothyng 
but the lady, 
to have his will of her. 
And she seyde to hym 
that he was a fole, 
for he wist noght 
what he askyd, 
for she was noght worldly. 
And the kyng seyde he wolde have nothyng elles. 
And she seyde to hym, 
"Siththen that ye wole aske nothyng 
elles," she wolde graunte hym 
som other thyng and noght that. 
And so she sayde thus: 
"Sire kyng, 
to thee, 
and to all other 
that cometh after thee, 
ye shul have werre withoute pees 
unto the nynthe degré, 
And ye shal be in subjeccioun of youre enemyes, 
And ye shal have gret nede to good and to catell. 
For ye aske thyng out of reson, 
for ye may have me noght, 
for Y am a spyritte." 
And fro that tyme all kynges of Ermonye 
have y-be in werre and needfull 
and under tribute of Sarasyns. 
Also a pore man 
somtyme wold wake that hauke, 
and he askid of the lady 
that he myght be ryche 
and happy in catell and marchaundyse. 
And the lady graunted hym, 
but she seyde 
that he askyd his undoyng, 
for greet pruyde 
that he shold have therof. 
But he that shal wake hath gret nede 
to kepe hym fro slep, 
for if he slepeth, 
he [fol. 35v] is lost. 
But this is noght the right way 
but for that mervayll. 
And fra Trapasond men goth 
to the Gret Ermonye, 
to a cité 
that men calle Artyron. 
And so to a hille 
that is y-called Sabissatel, 
and ther is another hille 
that men calle Airach, 
but the Jewes calle hit Thane, 
and ther resteth Archa Noe, 
and yit hit is uppon that hille. 
And a man may see hit 
in fair wether and cler. 
And that hille is 7 myle heygh. 
And som men seyth 
that they have be ther and put her fyngres in the hole 
wher the devel went out 
when Noe seyde Benedicité. 
But a man may noght wel go theder 
uppon that hille for snow 
that lith alway 
uppon that hille wynter and somer. 
For ther cometh 
never man sithe Noe was, 
but a monk 
that thorgh the grace of God 
went thider 
and broughte a plancke, 
that is yit 
at the abbey 
at the hille foot. 
For he hadde gret desyre 
to go uppon that hille, 
and he aforsed hym therto. 
And when he was 
at the thrydde part of the hylle upward, 
he was so wery he myght no ferther, 
and restyd hym ther and slepte. 
And when he woke 
he was doun 
at the hille foot. 
And thenne he prayde to God devoutly 
that He wolde suffre hym go uppe. 
And an angel seyde to hym 
that he sholde go uppe, 
and so he dide and broughte the planke. 
And suche com never man ther, 
and therfore they that seith 
that they have y-be ther, 
they gabbe. 
Fro thenne men goth to a cité 
that men calleth Tauzyre, 
and that is a fayr cité 
and a good. 
And bysyde that cité is an hille of salt, 
and therof ech man taketh what he wol. 
And ther dwelleth many Cristen men 
under tribute of Sarasyns. 
Fro thenne men goth to many tounes, citeis, and castelles many journeys toward Ynde, 
and cometh to a cité 
that is y-called Cassache. 
And ther mette thre kynges togedre 
and went to make present to Our Lord. 
And fro that cité men goth to a cité 
that is y- called Cardabago. 
And paynemys saith that Cristen men 
may noght dwelle ther, 
but they deye sone 
and they wyte noght why. 
And fro thenne men goth thorgh many contreis, citeis, and tounes, 
of which hit were moch to telle, 
[fol. 36r] 
tyl they come to a cité 
that is called Carnaa, 
that was woned to be so gret 
that the walles aboute were of 25 myle. 
And the walles beth y-sene yit, 
but hit is noght inhabited with men. 
And ther eyndeth the londe 
of the emperure of Peryse. 
On the ryght syde of that cité of Carnaa 
men entreth into the lond of Job, 
which is a good londe 
and a plenteuous. 
In this lond is the cité of Thomar. Job was a paynym, 
and he was Coffraces sone, 
and he held that lond 
as prince therof. 
And he was so ryche 
that he knew noght the hundred part of his good. 
And sithe he was so pore 
that he hadde no good 
but the grace of God. 
And afterward God makyd hym so ryche 
than he ever was byfore. 
And afterward he was kyng of Ydoyne and of Ysau. 
And thenne he was called Jobab 
and lyved kyng an 180 yer, 
and Job when he deyde was of elde 248 yer. 
And ther beth hilles 
wher men fyndeth manna, 
that is y-called bred of angelys 
that is a white thyng, 
ryght swete 
and more swetter 
than sugre other hony. 
And hit cometh of the dewe 
of hevene and falleth 
on the herbes and congelith and wexeth white. 
This lond of Job marcheth 
to the lond of Caldee, 
that is a gret lond 
and full of peple. 
And wymmen beth ther ryght lothlych 
and yvel y-clothed. 
And they go barfoot 
with an yvel cote, 
large and wyde and short to the kneys, 
and long slevys to the foot. 
And they have gret here 
and hangeth long aboute her sholdres. 
And then is a lond of Amasoyn. 
In that lond dwelleth no man 
but all wymmen, 
as men sayn, 
for they wole have no lordship of no man. 
For somtyme was a kyng in that lond, 
and men dwellid ther 
as men dede in other contreis. 
And he hadde a wyff. 
And hit byfell 
that the kyng made werre 
with hem of Zechie, 
and he was y -called Solopenuce, 
and he was slayn in batayll 
and all the good blood of his lond. 
And the quene, 
when she herde 
that and other ladyes also, that the kyng and her lordes wer slayn, 
they gadred hem togedre 
and slow all the other men 
that were left 
at hom in the lond, 
and syth that tyme [fol. 36v] 
dwelled no man ther. 
And when they wole have company of men, 
they sendeth for hem 
into another contré 
that is neygh to her lond. 
And then men cometh 
and beth ther 7 other 8 dayes, 
other also long as the wymmen liketh, 
and then they go agen. 
And if they have knave chyldren, 
they sendeth hem to her fadres 
when they con eete, go, and speke. 
And if they have mayde cheldryn, 
they kepe hem wel. 
And tho that beth of gentil blood, 
they brenne the left pappe awey, 
for beryng of a shyld. 
And if they be of lower blood, 
they brenne the ryght pappe, 
for shetyng with a bowe. 
For the wymmen of that lond 
beth all good werryours 
and beth ofte y-souded 
with other lordes. 
And the quene governeth that lond well, 
for that lond is all closed with water. 
Byside Amasoyne 
is a good lond and profetable 
that is y-called Turmaget. 
And for the greet profyte therof, Kyng Alysaundre 
let make ther a cité, 
that is y-called Alysaundre. 
And in the other syde of Caldee, 
toward the south, 
is Ethiope, 
a gret lond. 
In this lond 
in the south syde the peple is ryght black. 
In that side is a welle, 
that on the day the water is so colde 
that no man may drynk hit, 
and on the nyght hit 
is so hoot 
that no man may suffre hit. 
In this lond revers and waters 
beth all trobel 
and somdel salt 
for the gret heet. 
In Ethiope beth soch peple that han but oon foot, 
and they goo so faste 
that hit is mervayl. 
And that foot is so large 
that hit maketh shade 
and covert 
to his body for the sonne. 
In that lond is the cité of Saba, 
of which oon of the thre kynges 
was that soughte Our Lord. 
He was kyng ther. 
Fro Ethiop men goth to Ynde, 
and hit is y-called Ynde the Gretter, 
and hit is departed 
in thre parties, 
that is to say, 
Ynde the Moore, 
that is a full hot londe. 
And Ynde the Lasse 
that is a tempered londe. 
And the thridde party is toward the north, 
and ther hit is aryght colde. 
So that for gret forst the water 
wexith into cristal, 
and uppon that wexeth the good dyamaunde, 
that is a trobul colour. 
And that dyamaunde is so hard 
that no man may breke hym. 
Other diamaundes men fyndeth in Arabye, 
that beth noght so goode, 
that beth [fol. 37r] more nessh. 
And some beth in Cipre, 
and somme beth in Macydoyn, 
but the beste beth in Ynde. 
And somme beth y-founde in a mas, 
ther men fyndeth goolde fro the myne, 
and tho beth as hard as eny in Ynde. 
Also men fyndeth good dyamaundes 
uppon the roche of adamaundes in the see, 
as hit were hasel notes. 
And tho beth all square 
and poynted of her owen kynde, 
and they groweth togodres, 
the maule and the femaule. 
And they beth noryshed 
with the dewe of hevene, 
and they engendreth comunely 
and bryngeth forth 
other smale dyamaundes, 
that multeplieth and groweth all yeres. 
And Y have many tymes asayd 
that if a man kepe hem 
with a lytel of the roch, 
which he groweth uppon, 
and wete hym with Mayis dewe, 
they shal growe ech yer, 
and the smale shal wexe greet. 
And a man shal bere a dyamaunde 
uppon his lyft syde, 
and thenne hit 
is more vertu than elles, 
for the streyngthe of her growyng 
is toward the north, 
and that is the lift syde of the worlde. 
And if ye wole knowe the vertu of the dyamaund, 
Y shal telle yow, 
as men of that contré sayn. 
To hym that berith this dyamaund aboute hym, 
hit geveth hym hardynesse, 
hit kepith the lymes of his body hole. 
And hit gyveth victorye of his enemyes, 
and a mannes cause be trywe. 
Hit saveth a mannes wytte. 
Hit kepith a man fro stryff, 
fro ryot, 
fro yvell dremes, 
and fro soceryes and enchauntementz. 
Also none wylde bestes shal greve hym, 
ne assayle hym. 
Also the dyamaund shal be geve frely, 
withoute coveytyng other beggyng, 
and then hit is of more vertu. 
Hit helith hym 
that is lunatyk and hym 
that is y-traveyled 
with a devell, 
of venym and of poyson, 
if a man be brought in presens of the dya maund. 
And if eny other stoon 
be y-brought in presens of the dyamaund, 
anoon hit wexith moist 
and bygynneth to swete. 
And also a man may asay hym 
wel in this maner. 
Tak a stoon 
that is y-cleped adamaund, 
that is the shipmanis stone, 
that draweth the nedel to hym. 
And men ley the dyamaund 
uppon the adamaund, 
and then ley a nedle 
byfore the ada maund, 
and if the dyamaund [fol. 37v] 
be good and vertuous, 
the adamant may noght drawe the nedle to hym 
whiles the dyamaunt lith ther. 
And this is the preve 
that they doth byyonde see. 
But hit falleth ofte 
that the good dyamant losith his vertu many tymes, 
and they conne make his vertu com agen. 
Ther is a water 
that renneth thorgh the lond 
that men calleth Ynde; 
in that water men fyndeth elys of 20 foot long. 
In Ynde beth mo than 5 mille yles 
that men dwelleth ynne. 
And in ech of tho beth many citeis and moch peple, 
for men of Ynde beth of condicioun 
that they passeth noght 
out of her lond comonlych. 
For they dwelleth under a planete 
that men clepith Saturne, 
and that planete maketh his torn 
by the 12 signes in a monthe. 
And for Saturne 
is of so late steryng, 
therfore men 
that dwelleth under hym 
and that clymate haveth no good 
wyll to mech styryng aboute. 
And in our contré 
is all the contrarye, 
for we beth in a clymate 
that is of the mone 
and of leyght styryng, 
and that is the planete of way. 
And therfore hit gyveth us wyll 
to be moch steryng 
and to go into diverse contreis of the worlde, 
for hit passeth aboute the worlde 
more leyghtlych than another planete. 
Also thorgh Ynde men goth to the Gret See, 
that is y-called Oxean, and they fynde ther the yle of Ermes, 
whider marchauntz of Venyse, 
and of Gene, 
and of partyes of Cristendom cometh to bygge marchaundise. 
And hit is so hoot ther 
that mennys ballockys hongeth doun 
to her shankes. 
And men of that contré 
byndeth hem full straytly uppe, 
and they do hem anoynte 
with oynementz y-maked therfore, 
other elles myght they noght lyve in that lond. 
And other men and wymmen lyen 
al naked in ryvers and wateris 
fro undren of the day 
tyl hit be passed noon. 
And they lye all in water 
but her face, 
for gret hete that is ther. 
In this yle beth shippes 
withoute nayles of yre 
other bondes of yre, 
for the roch of the adamaund 
that beth in that see 
wolde drawe the shippes to hem. 
Fro this yle men goth by the see 
to the yle of Cana, 
wher is gret plenté 
of corne and wyne. 
And the kyng of this yle was somtyme 
so myghty 
that he helde [fol. 38r] 
werre with Kyng Alysaundre. 
And men of this yle han dyverse lawes, 
for somme worship peth the sonne, 
and somme the fyre, 
and somme addres, 
and som trees, 
and som the ferst thyng 
that they mete on the morwenynge, 
and som worshippeth simu lacres 
and som ydoles. 
For bytwyne simulacres 
and ydoles is differens, 
for sim ulacres beth ymages 
y-maked to licknes 
of what thyng a man wol. 
For som ymage hath thre hedes: 
on of man, 
another of an hors, 
and on of an oxe 
or other best that a man wole. 
And ye shal understande 
that they that worshipeth simulacres, 
they worshipe hem 
for som worthy men 
that were somtyme, 
as Hercules, other soch 
other whiche dede many mervayles in her tymes. 
For they seyn they woot wel they beth noght God of kynde, 
that maked all thyng, 
but they beth ryght wel with God 
for mer vayles 
that they doth. 
And so they sayn of the sonne, 
for hit chaungeth ofte tymes of the yer 
and geveth hete 
to norssh all thynges of the erthe. 
And for hit is 
of so gret profyte, 
they sey they wot well 
that hit is wel with God, 
and that God loveth hit wel more than eny other, 
and therfore they worshippeth hit. 
And thus saith thay of fure, 
for hit is profitable. 
And thus maketh thay skyles 
why they worshipe other planetes and thynges. 
And ydoles beth of alle quyke bestes. 
And of alle ydoles 
they sayn the oxe 
is best and holiest 
that is in the erthe, 
and most profitable than eny other best. 
And therfore they make her god 
that oon half man 
and that other half an oxe, 
for man is the best creature 
that ever God makyd. 
And they do worship to eddres 
and to other bestes 
that they mete ferst 
on the morwe. 
In this yle of Cana beth many wylde bestes and ratons. 
Ratons of that contré beth 
also gret as houndes her, 
and they take hem with mastyves, 
for cattes may noght take hem. 
Fro thenne men goon to a cité 
that is called Sarchie, 
and hit is a good cité 
and wel y-dyght. 
And fro thenne to the londe of Bomk 
and ther is the cité of Polomee, 
and under that cité is an hille 
that men callen [fol. 38v] Polombe, 
and therof taketh 
that cité his name. 
And at the foot of this hille 
is a fair well 
and hath a swet savour of all maner of spices, 
and ech oure of the day 
hit changeth his savour diversly. 
And whoso drynketh thries a day of that well, 
he shal be maked hole 
of alle maner sycknesses 
that he hath. 
For Y have dronke of that well, 
and me thynketh yit Y fare the better. 
Som men callen hit the well of youthe, 
for they that drynketh therof semeth 
evermore yonge 
and leven withoute gret syknesse. 
And they say that the well cometh fro Paradise, 
for hit is vertuous. 
In that contré groweth gyngyner, 
and thyder cometh marchauntz for spyces. In this contré men worshipeth the oxe 
for his gret meknesse and profyt 
that is on hym. 
And they make the oxe 
to travayle 
but 6 other 7 yer, 
and then they ete hym. 
And the kyng of that lond 
hath evermore 
an oxe with hym. 
And he that kepith hym, 
taketh his fees 
for his kepyng, 
and also he gadreth his uryne 
and his donge 
in a vestel of goold 
and berith hit to her prelate, 
that they calleth Archi protapaton. 
And the prelate bereth hit to the kyng 
and maketh theron 
a gret blessyng. 
And then the kyng putteth his hondes therynne, 
and thenne they calle hit gaule gaule. 
And he anoyneth his frount 
and his brest therwith. 
And they do therto moch worship and seyn 
that they shal be fulfeld 
thorgh vertu of the oxe, 
and that he is y-makyd holy 
thorgh the vertu of the oxe. 
And when the kyng hath thus y-do, 
then do other lordes so, 
and then other men, 
as they ben of degré. 
When they may have eny remanent y-left therof, 
they doth hit into tresorye. 
In this lond her ydoles beth half man and half oxe. 
In these ydoles beth wycked gostes 
and speketh to hem 
and geveth to hem answer of all thyng 
that they aske. 
Byfore these ydoles 
they sleyn her cheldren 
and sprengeth her blood 
uppon the ydoles 
and so make they sacrifyse. 
And if any man dey in that lond 
they brenne hym 
in toknyng of penaunce, 
and he were y-layd 
in the erthe 
he sholde suffre no penaunce 
for etyng of wormes. 
And [fol. 39r] 
if hys wyff have none cheldren, 
they brenne her with hym. 
And they seyn that hit is good resoun 
that she make hym companye in the other worlde, 
as she dede in this worlde. 
And if she have cheldren, 
she shal lyve with hem, 
if that she wole. 
And if the wyff deye 
byfore the man, 
they brenne her and the man, 
if that he wole. 
Fro this londe men 
goth many contreis and journees 
to a contré 
that is y-called Mabaron. 
And that is a gret contré 
and a gret kyngdome, 
and ther beth many fair citees and tounes. 
In this londe lyth Seynt Thomas 
in flessh 
in a fair tumbe 
in the cité of Calamye 
and the arme with the honde that he putte in Our Lordes syde when He was y-ryse 
fro deth to lyve, 
when Crist seyde thus: 
Noli esse incredulus sed fidelis. 
That is to say: 
"Be thow noght of wanhope but trywe." 
That same honde lyth yit 
withoute the tumbe al bare ther, 
and with that hand they geve ther her juge ment 
and her domes 
in that contré. 
For if stryff other debate 
be bytwyne two parties, 
they lete wryte her ryght 
and her mater in two bylles, 
and they beth putte in Seynt Thomas hande. 
And anoon the hand cast away that bylle that is fals and holdeth 
that other that is ryghtfull. 
And therfore men cometh 
fro ferre contrees 
to have jugementz of causes 
that beth in doute. 
In the cherche of Seynt Thomas 
is a greet ymage 
and that is a simulacre, 
and hit is wel y-dyght 
with precious stones and perles. 
And to that ymage men cometh 
fro ferre contrees 
with gret devocioun in pylgrimage. 
And som of tho that cometh in pylgrimage 
bereth sharp knyves 
in her hondes, 
and as they goth 
by the way they kytte her owen shankes 
and her thyes, 
that the blood may com out for the love of that ymage. 
And thay sey that he is holy 
that wole deye for his goddes sake. 
And som of tho pylgrymes, 
fro that tyme 
that they goon out of her hous, 
at ech thrydde pase they knelith adoun 
tyl they come to this ymage. 
And when they come ther, 
they have ensense, 
other som other sweet thyng, 
to ensense therwith that ymage, 
as we wole do to Goddis body. 
And byfore the cherche of this ymage [fol. 39v] 
is a stocke ful of water, 
and in that stock the pylgrimes casten her goold and selver, precious stones, 
and perles withoute nombre 
instede of her offrynges. 
And when the cherche hath nede of helpe, 
anoon they take hit up of that stock 
to amendement of the cherch. 
And ye shal understonde, 
when gret festes beth of this ydole, 
as dedicacioun of the cherch 
other the crounyng of the ydole, 
all the contré is assembled theder. 
And men setteth this ydole 
in gret worship in a chayre, 
with precious stones wel y- dyght 
with ryche clothes of goolde. 
And other, 
that ledith hym 
with solempnité aboute the cité, 
thay beth rychely aparayled. 
And byfore this chare goth ferst in processioun 
all the maydenes of the contré, 
two and two togedre. 
And after hem goth pylgrimes 
that beth y-come 
fro ferre contrees, 
of which pylgrimes, 
som falle adoun byfore 
that chare and lete the wheles go over hem, 
and so they beth dede, 
and som have ther her armes 
and sholdres to-broke. 
And this doth they for love 
of her ydole, 
that they sholde have the more joye. 
And overthwert and nexte byfore the chare goth 
all the mynstralles of that contré, 
as hit were withoute nombre, 
with many diverse melodyes. 
And when they ben come agayn to the cherch, 
they sette uppe the ydole 
in his trone. 
And for worship of this ydole two men, 
other thre, 
ben slayn with sharp knyves 
and with her good wylle. 
And as a man thenketh in our contré 
that he hath gret worship 
if he have a holy man 
to his kyn, 
so they say that tho that ben slayn ben seyntes, 
and they beth wryten in her letenyes. 
And when they ben thus dede, 
her frendes leet brenne her bodyes, 
and let take the askes, 
and let kepe hem ful welle as relykes. 
For they seyn that hit is holy thyng, 
and they have no doute 
of no peryle 
the whyle they have tho askes. 
For to go fro this londe 
and this contré 52 journeys, 
ther is a londe 
that men callen Lamoryse. 
And ther is gret hete, 
and the custome ther of men 
and wymmen goon all naked. 
And they skorneth hem 
that goth clothed. 
For they say that God maked Adam and Eve naked 
and that men sholde [fol. 40r] 
have no shame of that thyng 
that God makyd, 
for nothyng is foull that He makyde. 
And they belyve in God 
that makyde all the worlde. 
And ther is no womman y-wedded, 
but beth all in comune. 
And they say that God comaunded to Adam and Eve 
and to all that come of hem and seyde thus: 
Crescite et multiplicamini et replete terram. 
That is to say: 
"wexeth and be multeplied 
and fulfyll the 
erthe." 
And no man may say 
"this is my 
wyff," ne no womman, 
"this is myn husbonde." 
And when they have chyldren, 
they geve hem to wham they wole of men 
haveth delyd with hem. Also that lond is all in comune, 
for that a man hath in oon yer 
another man hath another yer. 
Also all goodes and cornes 
of that contré beth in comune, 
for ther is nothyng under loke. 
As ryche is oon man as another. 
But they have an yvel custome: 
they eten gladloker mannes flessh than other flessh, 
and thyder bryngeth marchauntes her cheldren to selle. 
And tho that ben fatte, 
they ete hem, 
and the other they kepe and fede hem 
tylle they ben fatte, 
and then they ete hem. 
In this lond nother in many other aboute, 
men may noght se the sterre 
that is y-clepid Transmontane, 
which standeth evene north 
and stereth never, 
by which shipmen beth y-lad, 
for hit is noght seyn toward the south. 
But ther is another sterre, 
which is y-clepid Anteryke, 
and that is evene agenst that other sterre. 
And by that sterre shipmen beth y-ladde toward the south, 
for that is noght y-seye toward the north. 
And therfore men may wel se 
that the lond and the see ys all round, 
for partyes of the firmament 
which sheweth in oo place 
and apereth noght in another place. 
And that may men preve thus: 
for yf a man myght fynde shypyng 
and men wolde go to see, 
men myght go all aboute the worlde above and bynethe. 
And preve Y thus 
after that Y have y-seye. 
For Y have be in Braban 
and y-seye 
the astrelabre of the sterre Transmontayne, 
and hit is 54 degreez hey in Almayne, 
and toward Beme hit hath 59 degreez, 
and more north hit hath 62 degreez 
in heyth and som munytes. 
And ye shal understonde 
that agenst the sterre 
in the north 
is the sterre An teryke. 
These two sterres styreth nevermore, 
and by hem turneth [fol. 40v] 
the firmament 
as a wheel in a extre, 
so that thees two sterres departeth 
all the firmament in two partyes. 
And thenne went Y toward the south 
and Y fond that in Lybie hit hath in heythe 18 degreez and somme munytes, 
of which munytes 60 maketh a degree. 
And so passyng by lond 
and by see toward contrees 
that Y have spoke byfore, 
and other londes and yles agenst hem, 
they fond this Anteryke 
of 33 degreez and 16 munytes. 
This beth 4 score and 15 degreez 
and ney half a munyte. And so hit lacketh bote 80 and ner half degré: 
thenne have Y sen all the firmament. 
And therfore Y sey sykerly 
that a man myght go 
all the worlde aboute, 
above and bynethe, 
and com agen to his owen contré, 
he that hadde shipyng, 
and alway he sholde fynde many londes 
and yles 
as beth in thylke contré. 
For ye wot wel that thes men 
that dwelleth ryght under Anteryke beth foot agenst foot of these 
that dwelleth under Transmontayn 
as wel as we. 
And thes men 
that dwelleth agenst us beth foot agenst foot, 
for alle partyes of the erthe 
have her contraryes of thynges 
which beth agenst hem. 
And ye shal understonde 
that the lond of Prester John, 
emperour of Ynde, 
is under us. 
For if a man shal go 
fro Skotlond other Ingelond toward Jerusalem, 
he shal go ever upward, 
for our londe 
is in the lowest partye of the west, 
and the lond of Prester John 
is in the lowest partye of the est. 
And they have day 
when we have nyght, 
and nyght when we have day. 
And as moch as a man ryseth upward 
out of our contré toward Jerusalem, 
as moche shal he go donward 
toward the lond of Prester John fro Jerusalem, 
and that is for all the erthe is round. 
Now ye have y-hurd telle that Jerusalem is in the myddel of the worlde, 
and that may wel be y-preved thus: 
for and a man ther take a sper 
and set hit evene 
in the erthe at mydday, 
when the nyght and the day is y-lyche longe, 
the sper maketh no shadowe. 
And David bereth wytnesse 
when he seyth thus: 
Deus operatus est salu tem in medio terre. 
That is to say: 
"God hath [fol. 41r] y-wrought hele 
in the myddel of the erthe." 
And therfore they that goth out of oure 
contrees of the west toward Jeru- salem, 
as many journeyes 
as they make to go theder upward, 
as many journeys shal they make to go 
into the lond of Prester John 
donward fro Jerusalem. 
And so he may go into thes yles, 
evene round all the roundnesse 
of the erthe and of the see, 
tyl he come evene under us. 
And therfore Y have y-thought many tymes of a tale 
that Y hurde when Y was yong, 
how a worthy man of oure contré 
wente a tyme to se the worlde. 
And he passyde Ynde 
and these iles 
byyonde Ynde, 
where beth mo than 5000. 
And he wende so longe 
by londe and by see seynge aboute the worlde, 
and he fonde an yle 
where he herde his owen speche, 
and dryvynge beestys saynge soch wordes 
as men dyde 
in his owen contré, 
of whych he hadde gret mervayle 
for he wiste noght 
how that myghte be. 
But Y say he hadde y-go so longe 
on londe and see, 
goynge aboute the worlde, 
that he was y-come 
into his owen marches. 
But for he myghte have no passage ferther, 
he turned agayn as he com, 
and so he hadde a gret travayl. 
And hit byfyl afterward 
that he wente into Northway 
in a tempest of wynde on the see, 
and droff hym 
so that he aryved in an yle. 
And when he was ther, 
hym thoughte that hit was the yle the whych 
he hadde y-be on byfore, 
where he hurde speke his owen speche 
as the men drof beestys. 
And that myghte ryght wel be, 
of all hyt be 
that simple men of connyng trowe hit nought, 
that men may go under the erthe. 
For as us thinketh 
that thes beth under us, 
so thenketh hem 
that we beth under hem. 
For if a man myghte falle 
fro the erthe into the firmament, 
by more skyle the erthe 
and the see 
that beth so hevy sholde falle into the firmament, 
but that may noght be. 
And therfore God saith thus: 
Non timeas me suspendi terram ex nihilo. 
That is to say: 
"Have no drede 
that Y have the erthe honged of noght." 
And if be al possible that a man may go al aboute the erthe, 
neverthelasse of 1000 men, 
oon ne sholde noght 
take the nexte way 
to his owen contré, 
for ther beth so many wayes [fol. 41v] 
that a man myght fayle, 
but if hit were the special grace of God. 
For the erthe is gret and long, 
and hit holdeth 
in roundnesse aboute, 
above and bynethe, 
20,400 and 25 myle, 
after the opynion of olde wyse men 
that seyn hit, 
which Y wole noght repreve. 
But after my lytel wyt, 
me thenkyth, 
save her grace, 
that hit is more aboute. 
And for to understonde better 
that Y wol say, 
Y ymagine a figure 
wher is a gret compas, 
and aboute the poynt of that compas, 
that is y-cleped centre, 
by another lytel compas departed 
by lymes in many partyes, 
and that thes lymes meteth 
to — gadre on the centre, 
so that as manye partyes other lemes 
as al the greet compas 
hath be on lytel compas, 
thow al the space be the lasse. 
Now by the greet compas set forth the firmament, 
the which by astronomyers is departed in 12 signes, 
and ech signe is departed in 30 degrees. 
This is 300 and 60 degres 
that is aboute. 
Now be the erthe departed 
in as meny partyes 
as the firmament 
and everych of these annswereth 
to a degré of the firmament. 
Thes beth in al 700 and 20. 
Now be thes in all multiplie 300 tymes and 60, 
and hit shal amounte in al 21,000 myle and 5, 
ech myle of 8 forlanges, 
as myles beth in other contrees. 
And also moche hath the erthe in compas 
and in roundenysse al aboute, 
after myn opynyon and myn understondyng. 
And ye shal understonde, 
after opyn- ion of olde wyse philosofres and astronomers, 
that Ingelond, Skotlond, Walys, 
ne Yrlond beth noght rekened 
in the heythe of the erthe, 
as hit semeth wel 
by all bookes of astronomye. 
For the heythe of the erthe is departed in 7 planetes, 
whiche beth y-clepid clymates. 
And these cuntreez 
that Y spake of beth not 
in these clymates, 
for they beth dounnward so toward the west. 
And also thes yles of Ynde 
which beth evene agenst us 
beth noght reckned in tho climates, 
for they beth toward the est so lowe. 
And climates goth aboute al the worlde. And ney thes yle of Lamory, 
which Y spak of, 
is another yle that men clepeth Somaber. 
Men of that yle and wymmen leet merke hem in the visage [fol. 42r] 
with an hoot yre 
that they beth knowe fro other peple, 
for they holdeth hemself the worthiest of the worlde. 
And they have werre evermore 
with tho men that beth naked, 
of which Y spake afore. 
But ther is another gret yle 
that men calleth Java, 
and the kyng of that contré hath under hym 7 kynges, 
for he is myghty and stronge. 
In that yle groweth 
alle maner of spices 
more plenté than in another place, 
as gyngyner, clowes, canel, notemyge, maces, 
and other spyces, 
And ye shal understonde 
that the notemyge bereth the maces. 
Al thyng is ther 
in plenté save wyn. 
The kyng of this londe 
hath a riche palays, 
for alle the greces 
in the halle and in the chambre, 
oon is goold, 
another is sylver, 
and all the walles ben y-coveryd 
and y-plated 
with goold and sylver. 
And in the plates ben y-write storyes 
of kynges 
and of knyghtes and batayles. 
And the pavement of the chambre 
is of goold and sylver. 
And no man wole trowe the rychesse 
that is ther 
but if he hadde y-seyn hit. 
The kyng of this yle 
is so myghty 
that he hath overcome the Gret Cane of Catay, 
that is the myghtiest emperour of the worlde. 
For they beth moch at werre, 
for the Cane wolde make hym holde of hym his londes 
and to be his soget under hym, 
and he wole noght. 
And for to go forth by see, 
men fyndeth an yle 
that is y-called Salamasse. And som men callen hit Patro, 
that is a gret kyngdome 
with many faire citees. 
In this lond groweth trees 
that bereth meele, 
of which men maketh brede fayr 
and white and of good savoure, 
and hit semeth as hit were of whete. 
And ther also beth other trees 
that bereth fenym, 
agayn which is no medicyne but oon, 
and that is to take the leves 
of that same tre 
and stampe hem 
with water and drynke hit, 
other elles he shal be dede sodeynly, 
for tryacle may noght help hym. 
And if ye wole wyte how the trees bereth meele, 
Y shal yow telle. 
Ferst men heweth hit 
with an ax 
aboute the foot of the tree, 
doun by the erthe, 
so that the rynde be pershid in many places. 
And then cometh out a lycour 
that is thicke, 
which they take in a vestell [fol. 42v] 
and set hit 
in the sonne to dryghe, 
and when hit is dryghe 
they do hit 
to the mylle to grynde hit, 
and then hit is fayr meele and whyte. 
And hony and fenym is y-drawe out of trees 
in the same maner 
and y-do into a vestell. 
In that ile is a dede see 
that is a water 
that hath no ground. 
And if anythinge falleth therynne, 
hit shal never be founde. 
By that see groweth grete cannes 
that beth soch reedes, 
and under her rootes men may fynde many precious stones of vertu. 
For he that bereth oon of thes stones uppon hym, 
ther may non yre der hym 
ne drawe blood of hym. 
And therfore tho that haven of thylke stones 
fighteth ryght hardely. 
And her enemyes 
that knoweth hem 
and the maneres of hem, 
they maketh hem quarelles sharp withoute yre, 
and so they slee hem. 
Than is ther another ile 
that is y-called Calonache, 
which is a good londe and plenteuous. 
And the kyng of that londe 
hath as many wyves 
as he wole, 
and he lyth never by oon of hem but oons. 
And that lond hath a mervayle 
that is noght in another lond: 
for alle the maner fisshes of the see cometh 
oon tyme of the yer, 
ech maner of fissh after other, 
and leith hem neygh the londe 
and som on the londe, 
and ther they lyen 3 dayes. 
And men of that londe cometh and taketh of hem what hem lyst, 
and then goth that maner of fyssh away. 
And then cometh another maner of fyssh 
and lyth ther other thre dayes, 
and men taketh of hem also. 
And thus doth alle maner of fysshes 
tylle all have ben ther, 
and so men taketh of hem 
what they wole. 
And men wot noght 
what is the cause, 
but they say that tho fysshes cometh theder 
to do worship to the kynge, 
as for most worthy kynge of the worlde, 
for he hath so many wyves 
and geteth so many chyldren. 
Also ther beth snayles so greet that 
in somme of her shelles 
men may be y- herborwed, 
as in a lytel hous. 
And if a man deye 
on that contré, 
they grave his wyff 
with hym al quyke, 
and saith hit is good skyle 
that heo make company 
in the other worlde, 
as she dude in this. 
Than is ther another ile 
that men callen Goffalles. 
Men of that yle, 
when her 
fren[fol.43r]des beth syke 
that they wene 
that he shal deye, 
they take hym and hong hym 
al quyke an a tree, 
and sayn that hit is beter that bryddes that beth angelys of God 
ete hym than wormes ete hym. 
Fro thenne men gon to an ile, 
and tho beth men of wicked kynde 
for they norsheth houndes to strangly men. 
And when her frendes beth sike 
and they hope 
that he shal deye, 
they lete houndes strangly hem. 
For hy wole noght 
that they deye kyndely deeth, 
for than sholde he suffre 
to greet penaunce, 
as they say. 
And when they beth thus strangled, 
than ete they his flessh instede of ffeneson. 
And then men goon to the ile of Melke. And ther men ben of wicked kynde, 
for they have no delyte 
but for to fyghte and sle men, 
for they drynkyn gladly mannes bloode. 
And he that may sle most men, 
he is at most name among hem. 
And if two men be at the debate 
and they be makyd at oon, 
hem byhoveth to drynke 
every otheris blood 
other elles the acoorde is noght. 
Than is ther another ile 
that is y-called Tracota, 
wher men beth as beestes 
and noght resenable, 
for they eten eddres 
and they speke noght 
but make soch noyse as eddres don. 
And they make noon fors of no rychesse, 
but of oon stone 
that hath 40 colouris 
that is y-called traconyghte. 
And they knowe noght the vertu of that stone, 
but they coveyte hym 
for the gret fayrenesse of hym. 
Fro that ile men goon to another yle 
that is y-called Natumeran. 
Men and wymmen 
of that contré hath houndes hedes, 
and they ben resonable. 
And they worshipeth an oxe for her god, 
and they gon all naked 
save a lytel cloth 
byfore her prevyteis. 
And they ben good men to fyght, 
and they beren a gret targe with wham 
they coveryn all her body, 
and a sper in her honde. 
And if they take any man in batayl, 
they sende hym to her kyng, 
which is a gret lord 
and devout in his faith. 
For he hath aboute his necke 
on a corde 
thre hundred perlys orient 
in maner of pater-noster of aumbre. 
And as we say oure Pater Noster and Ave Maria, 
so this kyng saith ech day 300 prayers 
byfore his god 
or he ete any mete. 
And he bereth also aboute his necke 
a rubye orient fyne and good that is neye a foot long. 
For whenne they chese her kyng 
they geveth [fol. 43v] 
hym that rubye 
to bere in his hond, 
and so they lede hym rydyng 
all aboute the cité. 
And therfore he bereth that rubye 
evermore aboute his necke, 
for if he bare noght that rubye 
hy ne wolde no lenger hold hym kyng. 
And the Greet Cane of Catay 
hath moch coveyted that rubye, 
but he myght never have hit 
for no werre 
ne for no catelle. 
And then is ther another ile 
that men callen Dodyn, 
that is a gret yle. And ther beth many diversytees of men, 
and they have wicked maneres, 
for the fadres eteth the sones, 
and the sones the fadres, 
and the housbond the wyff, 
and the wyff the housbond, 
and ech so of other. 
And if hit be so 
that the fader be syke, 
other the moder, 
other any of her frendes, 
the sone anoon goth 
to the prest of the lawe 
and prayeth hym 
that he aske of the god, 
that is her ydole, 
if his fader other moder 
shal deye 
of that sycknesse other lyve. 
And then the prest 
and the sone knelith adoun byfore the ydole devoutly 
and asken of hym 
and he annswerith hem. 
And if he say that he shal lyve, 
thenne they kepe hym wel. 
And if he sey that he shal deyghe, 
then cometh the prest 
with the sone 
and with the wyff other 
with what frend hit be to hym 
that is syke, 
and they ley her hondes 
over his mouth 
to stop his breth. 
And so they sle hym, 
and then they hewe his body 
all to peeces. 
They preye all his frendes 
to come 
and ete of hym 
that is dede 
and they maketh a greet feste. 
And when they have y-ete his flessh, 
they berieth the bones. 
And all tho of his frendes 
that were noght ther 
to ete of hym haven gret vylonye, 
so that they never- more ben y-holde his frendes. 
The kyng of that ile 
is a gret lord and myghty, 
and he hath under hym 54 iles, 
and ech of hem hath a kyng. 
And in som of thes 
yles beth men 
that haveth but oon eye, 
and that is in the myddes of her forhede, 
and they ete noght but raw flessh. 
And in another ile dwelleth men that haveth noon heed, 
and her eyen beth in her shuldres, 
and her mouth in her brest. 
And in another ile beth men that haveth a plat visage 
withoute nose and eye, 
but they have two smale holes instede of eyen, 
and [fol. 44r] 
they have a plat mouth lyples. 
And in another ile beth peple 
that beth bothe man and womman, 
and have membres of bothe. 
And when they wole they use bothe, 
that on at on tyme 
and that other at another tyme. 
And they gete children 
when they usen the mannes membres, 
and they bereth children 
when they use the membre of the womman. 
Many other maner of peple beth theraboute, 
of wham hit were to moche to telle. 
And for to passe forth, 
men cometh into an ile 
wher men beth ryght smale, 
and they have a litel hole 
instede of her mouth, 
and they mowe noght ete. 
But when they sholde ete other drynke, 
they souke hit thorgh a pype 
that is holgh thorghout. 
THE LAND OF MANCY. 
CAPITULUM QUARTUMDECIMUM. [Chapter 14.] 
For to go 
fro this ile toward the see of Occian estward many journeys, 
a man shal fynde the kyngdome of Mancy, 
and that is in Ynde. 
And hit is the best lond, 
and most delitable, 
and most plenteuous of alle good 
that is in the power of man. 
In this lond dwelleth Cristen men and Sarasyns, 
for hit is a gret londe, 
for ther- ynne beth two thousand citees 
and other many tounes. 
Ther goth no man on beg- gynge, 
for ther is no poure man. 
And tho men have thynne beerdes as cattes. 
And ther beth fayre wymmen, 
and therfore som men callen hit the lond of Albanye, 
for the whyte peple 
that is therynne. 
And ther is a gret cité 
that is y-called Latorym, 
and hit is moche more than Parys. 
In that lond ben breddes twyes as moche as in any other place of the worlde. 
And ther is good chepe of vitayles, 
and ther is gret plenté 
of gret eddres, 
of which they make gret festes 
and ete hem in gret solempnytees. 
For though a man make a feste 
and dyghte all maner of metes 
that beth most deynté, 
but he ordeyne some eddres 
and geve hem to mete, 
they have no thanke for all her feste. 
In this contré beth white hennes, 
but they have no fetheris but woll, 
as sheep in our lond. 
And wymmen that beth y-wedded bereth 
crounes 
uppon her hede 
to be knowe fro other. 
Fro this cité men goth many journeyes 
to another cité 
that is y-called Cessay, 
that is the most cité of the worlde. 
For hit is 50 myle 
a[fol. 
44v]boute the walles 
and ther beth many good gates, 
and at every gate is a good tour 
in which men dwelleth to kepe hit 
fro the Gret Cane, 
for hit marcheth uppon his lond. 
And at that oon syde of that cité 
renneth a good rever. 
And ther dwelleth Cristen men and other many, 
for ther is a good contré 
and a plenteuous. 
And ther groweth right good wyne 
that men callen begoun. 
In this cité was woned the kyng of Mancy 
for to dwelle. 
And so men goth 
by this ryver 
tyl they come to an abbey of monkes 
a lytel fro that cité. 
And that abbey is a gret gardeyn and a fair, 
in the which beth many trees of diverse frutes. 
And ther beth many mervelous herbes 
and other thynges 
that Y shal telle of. 
In that gardeyn beth many bestes, 
as baboyn, marmesettes, apes, and other. 
And when the covent hath ete among hem, 
they take the relyfe 
and bere hit 
to the garden 
and smyteth ons 
with a cleket of sylver 
which he holdeth in his honde. 
And sone therafter 
cometh the beestes out and any other, 
neygh 3000 other 4000, 
and he geveth hit hem 
in fair sylver fessel. 
And when they have ete, 
he smyteth that cleket agayn, 
and all the beestes goon agayn 
wher they come fro. 
And they say that thilke beestes beth soules of men 
that beth dede. 
And the fair beestes beth soules of lordes, 
and the foule beestes beth soules of other men. 
And Y asked hym if hit were noght betre to geve 
that relyve to pore men. 
And they seyde ther 
was no pore man 
in that contré, 
and though yit were hit more almes 
to geve hit 
to thilke soules 
that suffred ther her penaunce 
than to hem 
that may go and travayle for her mete. 
And fro thenne cometh men to the cité of Chibence, 
wher was ferst the sege of the kyng of Mancy. 
In this cité beth 40 brygges of stoon 
bothe fair and good. 
THE LONDE OF THE GRET CANE OF CATAY. 
CAPITULUM QUINTUMDECIMUM. [Chapter 15.] 
Fro the cité of Chibence 
they passen over a gret ryver of fressh water, 
and hit is ney 3 myle brood. 
And then men entren 
into the londe of the Gret Cane. 
This ryver goth thorgh the lond of pegmans, 
wher men beth of litel stature, 
for they ben but thre spanne longe. 
And they beth [fol. 45r] ryght fair, 
and they beth weddede 
when they beth but half yeres olde. 
These smale men travelen noght, 
but they have among hem gret men, 
as we beth, 
to travele for hem. 
And they have greet skorne of gret men, 
as we have of hem. 
And they lyveth but 8 yer, 
and he that lyveth so longe 
is y-holde ryght oolde ther. 
And thenne men goth thorgh many contreis 
to a ryver 
that is y-called Caro- masan, 
which renneth thorgh Catay 
and doth many tymes moche harme 
when he waxeth greet. 
And Catay is a gret contré and good, 
and ful of good 
and of mar chaundise. 
Theder cometh marchaundes every yer to fecche spices 
and other marchaundises, 
more comunely than they doth to another contré. 
And ye shal understonde 
that marchauntes that cometh 
fro Venyse and fro Gene, 
other fro eny other places of Lumbardie other Romayn, 
they goth by see. 
And by londe hit is 11 monthes 
and more 
or they come to Catay. 
And toward the est is an old cité 
in the province of Catay. 
And byside that cité the Tartaryns 
haveth y-maked another cité 
that they callen Cadom, 
that hath 12 gates, 
and bytwyne two gates 
evermore is a myle, 
so that the two citees, 
the olde and the nywe, 
is aboute more than 14 myle. 
In this cité is the sege of the Gret Cane 
in a ryght fair palays. 
And the garden is uppon an hille 
uppon 
which is a fair palays, 
and hit is the fairest 
that may be founde in any contré. 
And aboute that hille beth many trees 
berynge many diverse of fruytes. 
And aboute the hille 
is a gret ryver 
and a gret diche. 
And ther fast 
by beth many ryvers and vynes uppon ech syde. 
And in tho vyne and ryvers beth gret plenté of fissh 
and of wilde foules, 
which the Gret Cane may take 
with his haukes 
and go noght out of his palays. 
The halle of that palays 
is rychely dight, 
for withynne the halle beth 24 pylers of goolde, 
and alle the walles beth y-covered 
with rych skynnes of beestes 
that men callen panters, 
which ben fair and well smellyng. 
And for tho skynnes smelleth so well, 
no wicked smel may come in that palays. 
And tho skynnes ben as [fol. 45v] reed as blood, 
and they shyneth so agayn the sonne 
that unnethe any man may beholde hem. 
And men preesen tho skynnes 
for as moche hit were goold. 
And at the over eynde of the halle 
is a trone of the emperour, 
right heygh. 
And ther he sitte 
at his mete, 
at a table 
that is well y-bordured with goolde, 
and that bor dure 
is ful of precious stones 
and gret perles. 
And the greces 
the which he goth 
uppon 
to his trone 
beth 
of diverse precious stones 
bordured with goolde. 
And at the lift syde of his trone 
is the sege of his wiff, 
a gre lower than he sitteth, 
and that is of jasper bordured with goolde. 
And the sege of his secunde wyff 
is a gre lowere than his ferst wyff, 
and that is also bordured with goolde. 
And the sege of the thridde wyff 
is a gre lower than the secunde, 
for alway he hath thre wyves with hym, 
wherso he be. 
Besyde thes wyves 
on the same syde sitteth ladyes of kynne, 
ech lower than other 
as they beth wedded and of degré. 
And all tho that beth y-wedded haveth a contrefeit of a mannes foot 
uppon her hedes, 
half a foot longe and all y-maked 
with precious stones wel and rychely, 
in tocknyng 
that they ben in subjeccioun to man 
and under mannes foot. 
And they that beth noght wedded 
have no soch tocknynge. 
And in the right side of the emperour 
sytteth ferst his eldest sone, 
that shal be his eyre. 
And also he sitteth a degré lower than the emperour, 
in soch maner 
as the emperes sitteth, 
and by hym other lordes of kynne, 
ech lower than other 
as they ben of degré. 
And the emperour hath his table by hymself, 
that is of goolde 
and of precious stones 
and of white cristall 
other of yolgh bordured with goold. 
And ech of his wyves haveth a table by herself. 
And under the emperouris table sitteth 4 clerkes, 
and writeth al 
that he saith, 
good other ylle. 
And at gret festes, 
above the emperouris table 
and all the other tables in the hall, 
is a vyne y-maked of fyn goold [fol. 46r] 
that goth aboute the halle. 
And hit hath many branches 
y-like 
to the grapes of a vyne. 
Som beth white, som beth yolgh, 
som beth reed, 
som beth black. 
All the rede beth rubyes other cremans other alabans, 
the white beth of byrrel other cristall, 
the yolghe beth of topaces, 
the grene beth of emeraudes and crisolites, 
the blacke beth of oniches and geraundes. 
And this vine 
is thus y-maked of precious stones 
as properly that hit semeth 
that hit were a vyne growynge of the erthe. 
And byfore the borde of the emperour stondeth gret lordes, 
and no man so hardy to speke to hym 
but if he speke ferst, 
but hit be mynstralles 
to make solas to the emperour. 
And all the vessel, 
the which is y-served 
in halle and chambre, 
beth of precious stones, 
and namely at that table 
ther the lord sitteth: 
that is to say of jasper, cristal, amatist, 
and of fyne goold. 
And the coppes ben of emeraudes, sapheres, topaces, pydos and other maner stones. 
They have no deynté of sylver vessel, 
but they make of sylver greces, pylers, pament to halle and to chambre. 
And ye shal understonde 
that myne felawes and Y were soudeours 
with hym 16 monthes 
agayn the kyng of Mancy. 
And the cause was for Y hadde gret desyre 
to se the nobleye of the contré, 
if hit were y-shewed 
as we herde speke of. 
And for- sothe we fond hit rycchere and nobleour 
and more solempne 
than was told to us. 
And we sholde never have y-leved hit 
but if we hadde y-sey hit. 
But ye shal understonde 
that the mete and the drynke 
is more honeste 
in that contré 
than in any other, 
for alle the comons eteth noght elles 
but flessh of all maner beestes. 
And whan they have ete, 
they wype her hondes 
uppon her lappes, 
and they ete but ons a day. 
WHY HE IS Y-CLEPED THE GRET CANE. 
CAPITULUM SEXTUMDECIMUM. [CHAPTER 16.] 
And why he was called the Gret Cane 
Y shal telle yow. 
For ye wyte well 
that al the worlde was destruyed with Noeis flood, 
outtake Noe 
and his wyff 
and his chil dren. Noe had 3 children: Sem, [fol. 46v] Cham and Japhet. 
And Cham was he 
that un keverede his fader 
and skorned hym 
when he slepe, 
and therfore he was acursed. 
And Japhet covered his fader agayn. 
Thes thre bretheryn hadde all the londe for to parte. Cham toke the best partie estwarde 
that is called Assye, 
and Sem toke Affrik, 
and Japhet toke Europe. 
Cham was the myghtiest 
and the richest of his brethren, 
and of hym bycom the paynymes 
and the dyverse maner of men of yles, 
som hedles and other men defigured. 
And for this Cham, 
the emperour called hem 
after hym "Cham," 
and lord of all. 
But ye shal understonde 
that the emperour of Cathay 
is called "Cana" 
and noght "Cham," 
and for this skyle. 
Hit is noght longe 
that al Tartarye was in sub- jeccioun 
to other naciouns aboute, 
and they were maked herdmen 
to kepe beestes. 
And among hem were 7 lynages of diverse kyndes. 
The ferst was called Tartarye 
and that is the beste. 
The secunde lynage is y-cleped Tangoth, 
the 3 Eurace, the 4 Valayr, the 5 Semeth, the 6 Menchi, the 7 Sobeth. 
Thes ben holde of the Gret Cane of Cathay. 
Now byfill hit 
so that in the ferst lynage was an old man, 
and he was noght ryche, 
and men called hym Changyse. 
This man lay and slepe 
uppon a bed in a nyght, 
and ther com to hym a knyght all white, 
sittynge uppon a white stede, 
and seyde to hym, 
"Chane, slepest thow? 
God that is almyghty sende me to thee, 
and hit is His will 
that thow seye to thyn 7 lynages 
that thow be her emperour, 
for to conquere alle the londes 
that ben aboute yow. 
And they shal be in youre subjec- cioun, 
as ye have be in heres." 
And when hit was day he roos up and wente 
to his 7 lynages 
and sayde thes wordes, 
and they skorned hym 
and sayde he was a fole. 
And the secunde nyght the same knyght com to the 7 lynages 
and bad hem in Goddes byhalf to make Chaungise her emperour, 
" 
And ye shal be out of all subjec cioun, 
And ye shal have other londes 
aboute yow in subjeccioun." 
And uppon the morwe 
they chese Chaungice 
to her emperour, 
and dede to hym all worship 
that they myght do, 
and called hym Chane, 
as the white knyghte sayde. 
They wolde do all that he bad hem do. 
And tho he makede many statutes and lawes 
which he cal[fol. 47r]led Isacan. 
The ferste statute was that they sholde be obedient 
to Almyghty God and lyve 
that He shal delyvere hem 
out of all thraldom, 
and that they sholde calle uppon Hym 
in all her nede. 
Another statute was that alle men 
that myghte armes bere sholde be armed and numbred, 
and to every 20 sholde be a mayster, 
and to every 100 a maister, 
and to every 1000 a mayster. 
And thenne he commaunded 
to alle the grettest of principalles 
of the 7 lynages 
that they sholde forsake 
all that they hadde in heri tage and lordship, 
and they sholde be wel payed 
if that he wolde geve hem of his grace. 
And they dede so. 
Anoon he bade that every man 
sholde brynge his eldest sone byfor hym, 
and that every man sle his owene sone 
with his owene hondes 
and smyte of her hedes. 
And anoon they dede so. 
And when he sey they maked no lettyng 
of that he bade hem do, 
thenne he bade hem folwe his baner. 
And so he put in subjeccioun 
alle the londes aboute hym. 
And hit byfell uppon a day 
that the Chane rode 
with a fewe of his men 
to se the londe that he had wonne, 
and he mette with a gret companye of his enemyes. 
And ther he was cast adoun 
of his hors 
and his hors y-slayn. 
And when his men saw hym at the erthe, 
they wende he hadde be ded, 
and fled away, 
and her enemyes pur sued after. 
And when the Chane saw his enemyes 
wer fer he yede 
and hyd hym in a bossh, 
for the wode was thicke. 
And his enemyes come agayn fro that chace. 
They sought among the wode 
and they fond many men, 
but hym noght. 
And as they come by the place ther he was, 
they saw a bryd sitte uppon a tre, 
which bryd men callen an oule. 
And he sat above his hed uppon that tre, 
and then they sayde ther 
was no man 
for the bryd was ther, 
and so went thay away. 
And thus was the Chane y-saved 
fro the deeth, 
and so wente he away 
by nyghte 
to his owen men, 
which were fayn of his comynge. 
And fro that tyme hyderward men 
of that contré have y-do gret worship 
to that bryd, 
and more than to any other. 
And thenne he assembled all his men and rood 
uppon his enemyes 
and de struyed hem. 
And when [fol. 47v] 
he hadde wonne 
all the londes to Mount Belyan, 
the white knyght come to hym 
in a vision and sayde, 
"Chane, the wyll of God 
is that thow passe the Mount Belyan, 
and thow shalt wynne many londes. 
And for ther is no ryght passage, 
go thow to Mount Belyan 
that is uppon the see 
and knele 9 tymes theruppon agayn the est 
in the worship of God, 
and He wole shewe to thee 
a way how thow shalt passe." 
And the Cane dede so, 
and anoon the see 
that touchid the hille 
withdrow hym 
and shewed a fair way of 9 foot brode 
bytwyne the hille and the see. 
And so he passed and alle his men, 
and so wan he the lond of Cathay, 
that is the most lond of the worlde. 
And for tho 9 knelynges 
and the 9 foot of way, 
the Chane and the men of Tartarye 
haveth the numbre of 9 in gret worship. 
And when he had y-wonne the lond of Cathay, 
he deyde. 
And thenne regned after hym Chicoto Chane, his eldest sone. And his eldest brother went to wynne hym lond 
in other contrees. 
And they wonne the londe of Spruys and Russyghe 
and het hym Chane also. 
But they of Chatay 
is the grettest Cane, 
for he is the grettest lord of the worlde. 
And so he calleth hym in his lettres 
when he seith thus: 
Chane filius dei excelsi universam terram colencium summus imperator et dominus domin ancium. 
That is to say: 
"Chane, Goddes sone, 
emperour of alle tho that tylieth lond, 
and lord of all lordes." 
And the wryting aboute his gret seel saith thus: 
Deus in celo, Chanus super terram eius fortitudo omnium hominum imperator. 
That is to say: 
"God in Hevene, 
Chane uppon erthe His strengthe, 
emperour of all men." 
And the writyng aboute his prevy seel is this: 
Dei fortitudo omnium hominum imperatoris sigillum. 
That is to say: 
"The streynthe of God, 
seel of His pryvé seel, 
the emperour of alle 
men." 
And thow hit be so 
that they be noght Cristen, 
yit the Chane and the Tartaryns 
byleveth on Allmyghty God. 
ARAY OF THE COURT OF THE GRET CHANE. 
CAPITULUM SEPTIMUMDECIMUM. [Chapter 17.] 
Now Y have told yow why he is cleped the Gret Chane. 
Now shal Y telle yow the governaynge of his court 
when they make gret festes, 
and that is principaly 
at 4 tymes of the yer. 
The ferste feste is of his berynge, 
[fol. 48r] 
the secunde is when he was bore 
to the temple 
to be circumcised, 
the thrid is of his ydoles 
when they bygan ferst to speke, 
the 4 when his ydoles 
bygan ferst to do miracles. 
And at thes tymes 
he hath his men 
wel araed 
by thousandes and hundredes, 
and every man woot wel what he shal do. 
For ther beth ferst ordeyned 4000 riche barones 
to ordeyne the feste 
and to serve the emperoure. 
And thes barones haveth crounes of goolde 
wel y-dyght 
with perles and precious stones, 
and they beth all y-clothed 
in clothes of goold and cammaka ful richely. 
And they may wel have soch clothes, 
for ther they beth of lasse prys 
then wollen clothes ben her. 
And thes 4000 barones 
beth de parted on 4 parties, 
and every party is y-clothed 
in dyverse colour ful richely. 
And when the ferst 1000 is passed 
and haveth shewed hem, 
then cometh the secunde 1000, 
and so the thridde, 
and so the ferthe. 
And noon of hem speketh a word. 
And by that emperouris syde 
at the emperouris table 
sitteth many philosophers 
and of many sciences, 
of astronomye, nigromancy, geometrye, piromancy, 
and other many sciences 
and som haveth after hem 
astrelabers of goold 
and of pre- cious stones 
full of sond 
other coles brennyng. 
Som have orlages wel y-dight and richely, 
and other maner instrumentes of her sciences. 
And at certeyn oures 
when they seith tyme, 
they say to men 
that stondeth byfore hem, 
"Maketh pees," 
and then tho men 
that stondeth byfore crieth loude, 
that all tho in the hall may here, 
"Now beth stylle a while!" 
And then speketh oon of the philosophers and saeth thus: 
"Every man do reverence and loute to the emperour, 
that is Goddes sone and lord 
of all lordes 
and of all the worlde, 
for now hit is tyme." 
And then all men louteth 
and kneleth to hym on the erthe. 
And then byddeth the philosophers 
hem aryse up agayn. 
And at other oures other philosophers biddeth hem all put her fynger 
in her earis, 
and they do so. 
And at another oure, 
another philosophere byddeth 
that alle men sholde ley her hondes on her mouth, [fol. 48v] 
and they do so. 
And so after he byddeth hem take away, 
and they do so. 
And thus fro oure to oure 
they byddeth diverse thynges. 
And Y asked prevyly 
what hit sholde mene. 
And oon of tho maystres sayde 
that the loutynge 
and the knelynge on erthe 
at that tyme was tockne 
that all tho men 
that kneled so 
sholde evermore be trywe 
to the emperour: 
that for no geftes, 
ne for no heste 
they sholde never be traytour to hym. 
And the puttyng of the fynger in the earis hath this tocknynge: 
that never oon of tho men 
sholde her noon 
yvell y-spoke of the emperour, 
of fader ne of of moder 
ne of noon other, 
but he telle hit to the emperour 
other to his consayle. 
And ye shal understonde 
that no man dightteth nothyng 
to the emperour, 
ne breed, ne drynke, ne clothes, 
ne noon other thyng necessarye, 
but at certeyn tymes 
and oures whoche philosophers telleth. 
And if any man wole werry ageyn the em- perour, 
in what contré so hit be, 
these philosophers wite hit sone 
and telleth the emperour and his consaile, 
and sendeth men thyder to make an eynde. 
Also he hath many men 
to kepe bryddes, 
as gerfaucons, sperhaukes, faucon gentel, laurettes, sacres, paupenjayes spekyng, 
and other maner of foules. 
And he hath 11,000 olyfauntz and baboynes, marmusettes. 
And he hath fusicions 
to loke urines, 
of which 3000 ben Cristen men 
and 20 Sarasens. 
But he tretith more with Cristen men 
than with Sarasyns, 
and therwith in his court 
beth many barones 
and other that beth Cristen, 
and other that beth converted 
to our faith 
thorghe prech- ynge of good Cristen men 
that dwelleth ther. 
But ther beth many 
that wole noght that men wite 
that they ben Cristen men. 
And he hath in his chambre 
a pyler of goold, 
in which is a rubye 
and a charbocle 
which is a foot long, 
and that geveth lyght all nyght 
to all the chambre. 
And he hath many other precious stones and rubyes, 
but that is the grettest and the beste. 
This emperour dwelleth 
in the somer toward the north, 
in a cité that men callen Camelat. 
Ther is ryght an hoot londe, 
and ther dwellith he for the most partye. 
And when this Gret Cane shal ryde [fol. 49r] 
fro oon contré to another 
they or deyneth 4 ostes of peple, 
of which the ferst goth afore hym a dayes journey. 
For that oste lith a nyght 
ther 
he shal lye another morwe, 
and ther is good plenté of vitayles. 
And another gooth on the ryght syde, 
and another on the lift syde, 
and on every oste is moch peple. 
And then cometh the ferthe oste 
byhynde hym a bowe draught, 
and therin beth mo men 
than of eny of the other. 
And ye shal understonde 
that the emperour rydeth uppon an hors, 
but if he wole wende 
to any place 
with privé mayne 
he rydeth in a chare 
with 4 whelys. 
And theruppon is y-maked a chambre of tre 
that men calleth lignum aloes, 
that cometh out of Paradys Terrestre, 
and that chamber is covered withynne 
with plates of fyn goold 
and precious stones and perles. 
And foure olefantes 
and 4 stedes goth ther ynne. 
And 5 other 6 gret lordes 
rydeth aboute the chare 
so that noon other man 
shal com ney hym 
but he calle hem. 
And on the same maner 
rydeth the quene with an ost by another syde, 
and the emperouris sone 
in the same aray. 
And they have so moch peple 
that hit is mervayle to se. 
Also the lond of the Gret Chane 
is departed in 12 provinces, 
and every prov ince hath mo than 2000 citees 
and other good tounes many. 
And every province hath a kyng. 
Also when the emperour rideth thorwe the contré 
and passeth thorgh citees and tounes, 
every man maketh fire 
byfore his dore in the street, 
and they caste encense 
other som other good thyng 
to geve good smell 
to the emperour. And if men of religion 
which ben Cristen dwelle ney wher he shal passe, 
they mete hym with procession. 
And they have a crosse and holy water 
byfore hem, 
and they synge thus, 
Veni creator spiritus, 
with a loud vois. 
And when he seeth hem come, 
he commaundeth the lordes 
that rydeth ney hym 
to make way, 
that the religious men may come to hym. 
And when he seeth the cros, 
he dooth of his hatte, 
whiche is wel maked and rychely 
with precious stones and gret perles, 
and then he louteth to the cros. 
And he that is priour other prelat [fol. 49v] 
of that religious goth and seith orisons 
byfore hym 
and geveth hym 
his beneson with the crosse, 
and he louteth 
to his beneson devoutly. 
And then the same prelate geveth hym 
of som fruyt 
of the numbre of 9 
in a plate of goold. 
For the maner is so ther, 
that no strange man shal come 
byfore the emperour 
but he geve hym somthyng, 
after the olde lawe that seith thus: 
Nemo accedat in conspectu meo vacuus. 
That is to say: 
"No man come in my sight voyde." 
And thes religious men goon forth fro the emperour, 
so that no man of the oste defouleth hem. 
Also the religious men 
that dwelleth ney wher the emperesse 
other the emperouris sone 
shal come and do in the same manere, 
for this Gret Chane 
is the grettest lord of the worlde. 
For Prester John is noght 
so gret as he, 
ne the soudan of Babyloyn, 
ne the emperour of Perce 
ne of Grece. 
This peple byleveth on God 
that makide all the worlde, 
and yit have they idoles of goold and sylver. 
And to thes idoles 
they offre the formest mylk of her beestes. 
And this Gret Chane hath 3 wyves, 
and the ferst most principal was Prester Johnis doughter. 
Also men of this contré 
bygynnen 
to do all her thynges 
in the nywe mone, 
and they worship moche the sonne and the mone. 
And they hold hit gret synne 
to breke a bone with another, 
and to shede mylk 
on the erthe 
other any other licour 
that men may drynke. 
And the most synne 
that they may do 
is to pisse in house 
wher they dwellen. 
And he that pissith 
on his hous 
shal be slayn. 
And of all thes synnes 
they shryve hem to her prestes, 
and for her penaunce they geve sylver. 
And that place wher men haveth thus y-pissed 
byhoveth to be halwed, 
other elles may they noght come ther. 
And when they han doon her penaunce, 
they shal passe thorgh a fyre, 
for to make hem clene of her synnes. 
And when men of that contré have eten, 
they wype her hondes 
on her lappes, 
for they have none bordes 
but byfore gret lordes. 
Also when they have eten, 
they put her disshes 
and her doblers [fol. 50r] unwassh into the potte other caudren. 
And the flessh they leven 
when they have eten, 
till they ete another tyme. 
They leve hit stylle in the crocke. 
And rich men drynken mylke of mares 
other asses and other beestes. 
And another drynke ther 
is 
that is maked of mylke and water togedre, 
for they have no wyne nother ale. 
And when thay goon to werre, 
ful wysly every of hem bereth two bowes other thre, 
and many arwes, 
and a gret axe. 
And knyghtes and gentyles have shorte swerdes. 
And whoso fleith on batayle, 
they sle hym. 
And they beth ever aboute to brynge all londes 
in subjeccioun to hem. 
For they saith that her prophecies seyth 
that they shal be overcome 
by shot of archers, 
and that they shull be turnd to her lawe, 
but they wyte never what men tho sholde be. 
And that is gret peryle 
to pursue the Tartaryns 
when they flee, 
for they wole shet byhynde hem 
and sle also well as byfore. 
For they have smale eyen and litel berdes, 
and they comunely ben fals, 
for they holdeth noght 
that they byheit. 
And when a man shal deie among hem, 
they stryke a sper 
on the erthe 
bysides hym. 
And when he draweth to the deeth, 
thei goon alle out of the house 
tyll he be deed, 
and then they putte hym 
in the erthe in the feld. 
And when the emperour the Gret Chane is dede, 
they sette hym in a chaire 
amyddes the toun 
and setteth 
byfore hym 
a table y-helid 
with a cloth, 
and flessh theruppon and other metys, 
and a coppe full of mylke of a mare. 
And they set a mare 
with her fole 
bysyde hem, 
and an hors y-sadelid and brydelid. 
And they leggen uppon the hors goold and selver. 
And then they make a gret grave, 
and hym and all these other thynges 
they putte ynne the grave togedre. 
And they say 
when he cometh to another worlde, 
he shal noght be withoute an hous, an hors, and other thynges. 
And the mare shal geve hym mylke 
and bryng forth mo hors, 
tylle he be wel astored 
in the other worlde. 
For they byleve 
when they ben dede 
that they sholde ete and drynke in another worlde, 
and have solas of her wyves 
as they have. 
And after that hit is layd on erthe, 
no man be hardy to speke of hym byfore [fol. 50v] his frendes. 
And when the emperour the Gret Chane is thus dede, 
the 7 lynages goth to- gedre, 
and they chese his sone 
other the nexte of his blood, 
and they sey thus: 
"We wole and we praye 
and we ordeyn 
that thow be our lord 
and our emperour." 
And he answereth thus: 
"If ye wole that Y regne uppon yow, 
every of yow that Y commaunde shal do, 
and if Y bydde 
that eny shal be slayn 
he shal be slayn anoon." And they answeren all with oon vois, 
and saeth thus: 
"All that ye bydde shal be doon." 
Then saeth the Chane the emperour: 
"Fro this tyme now herafter, 
myn word shal be sheryng as my swerd." 
And then they sette hym 
on a chaire and crouneth hym. 
And then all the citees 
and good tounes senden hym presentes, 
so that he shal have that same day more 
then a cartfull of goold and selver and pre- cious stones, 
and other many jewelles. 
And lordes seyndeth hym hors and riche clothes 
of camacas and tartaryns 
and many other. This lond of Chatay 
is in Asye the Depe, 
and this lond marcheth westward 
uppon the kyngdom of Percey, 
the which was somtyme oon 
of the 3 kynges 
that went to present Our Lord in Bethleem. 
In the lond of Corasen, 
which is in the lond of Catay 
on the north syde, 
is gret plenté of good 
but ther is no wyne, 
which lond hath 
at the est syde 
a gret wilder- nesse 
that lasteth more than 100 journeys. 
And the leste cité 
of that lond is called Corasayn, 
and after that cité 
is that lond called. And men of this contré 
beth good werryours 
and ryght hardy. 
And ther ney 
is the kyngdom of Coman, 
that is the most kyngdome of the worlde. 
But hit is noght habited, 
for on a place in that lond 
is so gret cold 
that no man may dwelle ther, 
and in another place is so gret hete 
that no man ther may dwelle. 
And ther beth so many flyen 
that a man woot noght 
in what syde he may turne hym. 
In this lond men lyen in tentes, 
and they brenne mucke of beestes 
for defaute of wode. 
This lond descendeth toward Spruys and Rossye and Turkye. 
In this lond renneth the ryver of Ethel, 
which is oon of the grettest [fol. 51r] ryvers of the worlde. 
And hit is every yer y-froze 
so hard 
that men fight theruppon 
in gret batayle 
both on hors and on foote, 
mo than 100,000 of men at ones. 
And a lytel fro that ryver 
is the Gret See of Oxean, 
that men calle Maure, 
and in this Maure 
is gret plenté of fyssh. 
And then to Caspize, 
and at Caspyze beth ful strayte passages 
to go toward Ynde. 
And therfore Kyng Alisaundre let make ther a cité 
that is y-called Alisaun- dre, 
to kepe that passage 
so that no man shal passe 
but he have leve. 
And now that cité is called Port de Feare. 
And the principal cité of Coman is called Sarochize. 
This is oon of the 3 wayes 
that gooth to Inde, 
bot in this way may noght many men go togedre 
but in wynter. 
This passage is called Barkent. 
And another way is for to go 
to the londe Turkes- ton thorgh Perce, 
and in this way beth many journeyes and wildernesse. 
And the 3 way that comth fro Cosmanne 
and gooth thorgh the Gret See 
and the kyngdom of Abcare. 
And ye shal understonde 
that alle thes kyngdomes and londes into Pers ben y-holde 
of the Gret Chan of Chatay, 
and other many mo. 
And therfore he is a gret lord of men and of londes. 
THE LOND OF PERS. 
CAPITULUM OCTAVUMDECIMUM. [Chapter 18.] 
Now Y have devised the londes 
and the kyngdomes toward the north 
to com fro the lond of Cathay 
unto the londes of Spruys, 
wher Cristen men dwelleth. Now shal Y telle 
of other londes and kyngdoms 
comyng fro Chatay, 
comyng fro the Gregyssh 
See wher Cristen men dwelleth. 
And for as moche as hit 
is nexte 
to the Gret Chane of Chatay, 
the emperour of Perce is grettest lord, 
therfore Y shal speke of hym. 
And ye shal understonde 
that he hath two kyngdoms. 
That oon bygynneth toward the est, 
toward the kyngdom of Turkeston, 
and hit lasteth estward 
to the see of Caspise, 
and southward to the lond of Ynde. 
And this lond is good and playn 
and wel y-manned 
and of many citeis, 
but the two citees 
that ben most principale 
ben y-cleped Battria and Sorman Gramang. 
And that other kyngdom [fol. 51v] 
of Perce lasteth 
fro the rever of Fyson 
to the Gret Ermonye, 
and northward to the see of Caspyse, 
and so forth to the lond of Ynde. 
And this is aplentuous lond and good. 
And in this kyngdom beth thre principal citees: 
Nessabor, Saphan, and Sarmasse. 
And Sarmasse is in the lond of Ermonye, 
in which wer somtyme foure kyng- doms. 
And Perce lasteth westward to Turky in leyngthe, 
and in brede lesteth 
fro the cité of Alisaundre, 
that now is y-called Port de Feare, 
unto the lond of Medy. 
In this Ermonye beth many fayre citees, 
but ther Canryssy is most of name. 
This lond of Medy 
is a lond but noght brood, 
that bygynneth estward 
to the lond of Perce and Inde the Lasse, 
and lasteth toward the kyngdom of Caldee, 
and northward lasteth to the Lytel Ermonye. 
The beste citees 
of that lond ben y-called Garaghe and Karmen. 
And then is the kyngdom of Gorge, 
that bygynneth estward 
at the gret hylle 
that is y-called Abyor. 
This lasteth fro Turky to the Gret See 
and this lond of Medy 
and of the Gret Ermonye. 
And in this lond beth two kynges, 
on of Akas 
and another of Gorge. 
But he of Gorge 
is in subjeccioun 
to the Gret Chane, 
but he of Akas hath a strong contré, 
and he defendith hym 
wel fro his enemyes. 
In this lond of Akas 
is a gret mervayl, 
for ther is a gret contré 
that is ney 3 journeys aboute, 
and hit is y-called Hamson. 
And that contré is covered 
al with derknes 
so that is no lyght. 
And men ther der noght go 
in that contré for hit is so derke. 
And yit men 
of that contré 
that beth ther sayen 
that they may here 
somtyme therynne voys of men, 
and of hors, 
and of cockes crowyng, 
and therfore men 
wyteth wel 
that men dwellen therynne. 
And they say that hit is derknesse 
that cometh thorgh miracle of God 
that He shewed for Cristen men. 
For hit was som tyme 
a wicked emperour of Perce 
that men called him Saures, 
and he pursued Cristen men 
to destruye hem, 
and for to make hem do sacrifise 
to his fals goddes. 
And at that tyme 
in that contré dwelled many Cristen men, 
which forsooke her [fol. 52r] good 
and her catell 
and all rychesses, 
and wolde go into Grece. 
And when they were all on a gret playn 
that men callen Megone, 
the emperour and his men pur sued hem 
so faste that alle the Cristen men setten hem 
on her kneys 
and prayed to God 
that He wolde help hem. 
Afterward ther come a thicke cloude, 
and over clapped hem, 
the emperour 
and all his oste, 
so that they myght never go away, 
and somme dwelleth ther yit 
in that derknesse. And the Cristen men went 
wher they wolde, 
and therfore they myghte sey thus: 
A Domino factum est istud 
et est mirabile in oculis nostris. 
That is to say: 
"Of Our Lorde this is y-do, 
and that is mervayl in our eyen." 
Also out of this derk londe comth a ryver, 
that men may se by takyng of good 
that men dwelleth therynne. 
And then the nexte 
is the lond of Turkye, 
that marcheth to the Gret Ermonye. 
And therynne beth many contrees, 
as Capas, Saure, Brike, Quecissioun, Pytan, and Geneth. 
In ech of these beth many good citees. 
And hit is a playn lond 
and fewe hilles and fewe ryvers, 
and hit is plenteuous of vuryk and rychasse. 
Than is the kyngdome of Mesopotayn, 
that bygynneth estward 
at the flum of Tygre 
at a cité 
that men calleth Morcelle. 
And hit lasteth westward 
to the Fame Eufrates, 
to a cité that men callen Rochaus, 
and fro the Heye Ermonye unto the Lasse. 
And hit is a good lond 
and a playn, 
and hit marcheth 
to the lond of Caldee. 
And the lond of Ethiope marcheth estward 
to the gret wyldernesse, 
and westward to the lond of Nubyse, 
and southward to the kyngdome of Maritane, 
and northward to the Rede See. 
And this Maritane, 
that lasteth fro the hilles of Ethiope 
into Lybye the Heye, 
and hit marcheth into Nubye 
wher dwellen Cristen men. 
And then is Nubye the Heye and the Lowe, 
which that lasteth 
to the gret see of Spayne. 
THE KYNDOM OF CALDEE. 
CAPITULUM NOVEMDECIMUM. [Chapter 19.] 
Now have Y spoke and y-told 
of many contreis 
of this side 
and of the kyngdom Catay, 
of which many beth obesshant to the Gret Chane. 
Now then Y shal speke of londes and of contrees and yles 
that beth yende Catay. 
And [fol. 52v] 
whoso shal goo fro Chatay 
to Ynde the Heye and the Lowe, 
he shal go thorgh a kyngdom 
that men callen Caldee, 
and that is a gret lond. 
And ther groweth fruyt 
as hit were goordes. 
And when hit is rype, 
men sher hit asondre. 
And they fynde therynne 
as hit were a beest of flessh, blod, and boon, 
and as hit were a lytel lombe 
withouten wolle. 
And they eten that beest 
and the fruyt also, 
and that is a gret mervayle. 
Neverthe les Y seyde to hem that Y helde 
that no gret mervayle, 
for Y sayde that in my contré beth trees 
that bereth fruyt 
that bycometh bryddes fleynge, 
and tho beth good to ete. 
And they had gret mervayle of this. 
In this lond 
and in many other aboute beth trees 
that berith clowes and notemyges, canel and other spices. 
And ther beth vynes 
that bereth gret grapes, 
that a strong man shal be besy 
to bere a clustre therof. 
In that same lond, 
Jewes ben enclosid 
in the hilles of Caspyze, 
that men callen Uber. 
And thilke Jewes ben of the kynde of Gog Magog, 
and they may noght 
com out at no syde. 
Ther wer enclosed 22 kynges 
with other peple 
that dwelled byfore 
bytwyne the hilles of Siche. 
For the kyng Alisaundre chased hem thider among thilke hilles, 
for he trowed to have enclosed hem 
ther thorgh worchyng of men, 
but he myght noght. 
And tho he prayde to God 
that He wolde fulfylle 
that he hadde bygonne, 
and God herd his prayer 
and enclosed the hilles togedre 
so that the Jewes dwelleth ther 
as they were y-loke in a castel. 
And ther beth hilles alle aboute hem but at oon syde, 
and ther is the see of Caspize. 
And som man myght aske, 
"Syth ther is a see 
at oon syde, 
why go they noght out ther?" 
But that Y answer and say, 
though hit be so y-called a see, 
hit is no see 
but a stonk stondyng among hilles, 
and hit is the grettest stonk 
of alle the worlde. 
And if they went over that see, 
they wyte noght wher to aryve, 
for they conne noght speke 
but her owen langage. 
And somtyme hit is so 
that som of the Jewes gon over the hilles. 
But many may noght passe ther togedre, 
for the hilles beth so gret and so heye. 
And men say in the [fol. 53r] 
contré aboute 
that in the tyme of Antecrist 
thay shulleth do mych harme to Cristen men. 
And therfore all the Jewes 
that dwelleth aboute in the worlde lerneth to speke Ebreu, 
for thilke Jewes 
that dwelleth among thilke spekith none thyng but Ebreu. 
And then shal these Jewes 
speke Ebreu 
to hem as Y trowe, 
and lede hem to Cristendome 
for to destruye men of Cristendom. 
For these Jewes sayen they wyte wel that the Jewes 
that dwelleth among thilke hilles 
shulleth come oute, 
and Cristen men 
shal be in her subjeccioun 
as they ben now under Cristen men. 
And if ye wole wyte 
how they shal fynde the passage out, 
as Y have understonde 
Y shal say yow. 
In the tyme of Antecrist, 
a fox shal make his den 
in the same place 
wher Kyng Alisaundre leet make the gates. 
And he shal worche in the erthe 
that he shal go thorgh out 
tyl that he come among the Jewes. 
And when they seyn this fox 
they shal have gret mervayle of hym, 
for they sawe never none soch a beest. 
And they shul chace this fox 
and pursue hym 
til he be fled 
into his hole 
that he come fro. 
And then shul the Jewes grave 
after hym 
as he went 
til they fynde the gates, 
which ben makyd with gret stones 
wel y-dight with sement. 
And they shal breke these gates, 
and so shal thay come out. 
Then is the lond of Bakarie 
wher beth wicked men and felle. 
In that lond beth trees 
that bereth wolle 
as hit were of sheep, 
of which they make hem clothis. 
In this lond beth many griffons, 
mo than in other londes. 
And som men sayen 
that they have the body 
byfore as an egle 
and byhynde as a lyon, 
and hit is so. 
But the grif fons haveth a body gretter than 8 
and strenger than an 100 [fol. 53v] egles, 
for he wole bere fleynge 
to his neste 
a gret horse 
and a man uppon hym y-armed, 
other two oxen y-yoked togedre 
as they go 
at the plow. 
And he hath gret nayles 
and long on his feet, 
as hit were hornes of oxen, 
and of thilke nayles they make coppes to drynke of, 
and of his rybbes 
they make bowes to shet with. 
THE LOND OF PRESTER JOHN. 
CAPITULUM VICESIMUM. [Chapter 20.] 
Fro this lond of Bacarie, 
men goon many journeys 
to the lond of Prester John, 
that is the emperour of Ynde, 
that men callen his lond Pentoxorie. 
This emperour Prester John 
hath many good citees and tounes 
and many gret iles and large, 
for the lond of Ynde is departed in iles 
by cause of the gret floodes 
that cometh out of Paradis. 
And also in the see beth many gret iles. 
And the best cité of Pentoxorie 
is y-called Nyse, 
for that is a noble cité 
and a ryche. 
Prester John hath under hym many kynges 
and many diverse peeple. 
And his lond is good and ryche, 
but noght so ryche 
as the lond of the Gret Chane. 
For marchauntes cometh noght so moche thider 
as they doon 
to the lond of the Gret Chane, 
for hit is longer way. 
And also they fyndeth in the ile of Catay 
all that they have nede to, 
as spices, clothes of goolde, 
and of other thyng. 
And thow hit be beter chepe 
in the lond of Prester John, 
yit they leve hit 
for the lenger way 
and gret periles of the see. 
For in the see beth many places 
wher ben many roches of adamaundes, 
which of his owene kynde draweth yre to hym. 
For Y went ones in that see, 
and Y say as hit had 
y-be a gret ile of trees growyng as stockes. 
And oure shipmen sayde that thilke trees 
were of shippes [fol. 54r] mastes 
that sayled on the see, 
and so abode the shippes 
ther thorgh vertu of the adamaund. The lond of Prester John is longe, 
and marchauntes cometh thider 
thorgh the lond of Perce 
and cometh to a cité 
that is y-called Ermes, 
for a philosopher 
that men called Ermes founded hit. 
And then is another cité 
that is y-called Soboth. 
And ther is lytel whete and barlich, 
and therfore they eten ryse and mylke 
and chese and other fruytes. 
And ther ben gret plenté of popynjayes, 
as ben in other contreyes of larkes. 
This emperour Prester John 
weddeth communely the doghter of the Gret Chane, 
and the Gret Chane his doghter. 
In this lond beth many precious stones 
so gret and brode 
that they make vessel therof, 
as platers, coppes, 
and other thynges. 
This Prester John is Cristen 
and a gret party of his lond also, 
but they have noght 
alle the articles of our feith. 
For they byleve wel on the Fader, Sone, and Holy Gost, 
and they make noon fors of no catel. 
And Prester John hath under hym 72 provinces other contreys, 
and ech hath a kynge, 
and thilke kynges haveth other kynges under hem. 
And in this lond beth many mervailes, 
for in that lond is the Gravel See, 
that is al sonde and gravel and no water, 
and ebbeth and floweth 
with gret wawes 
as the see dooth. 
And hit resteth never, 
ne no man may passe that see with shippe 
neyther noon other wyse. 
And in that see men fyndeth good fissh 
of other shap 
than is in other sees, 
and of good savour 
and good to ete. 
In that contré is a playn among hilles. 
In the playn groweth trees 
that at sonne rysing every day 
bygynneth to growe. 
And so they groweth til mydday 
and berith fruyt, 
but men der noght ete therof for hit is maner of ire. 
And after mydday hit turneth agayn to the erthe, 
so that when the sonne is doune hit 
is nothyng y-sene. 
In that contré beth [fol. 54v] 
many popinjayes spekyng, 
the which spekith of her owen kynde 
as pertly as doth men. 
When this emperour Prester John weyndith to batayle 
he hath no baner tofore hym. 
But he hath thre crosses y-bore byfore hym, 
oon of fyne goold, 
and thilke beth wel y-dight with precious stones. 
And for kepyng of every crosse beth ordeyned 
a thousand men of armes and mo than 100,000 of foot men, 
in the maner as men 
kepeth a standard in batayle. 
And when he rideth 
in another maner 
in lond of pees, 
then hath he y-bore 
byfore hym a crosse of tree, 
noght y-peynted and withoute goold 
and sylver and precious stones. 
And hit is all playn in tokneynge 
that Our Lord deyed 
on a crosse of tre. 
And also he hath y-bore 
byfore hym a plate of goold full of erthe, 
in tokenynge 
that his lordship 
and his noble aray 
is noght and shal turne into erthe agayne. 
And also another vessel is y-bore byfore hym ful of jewels 
and goold and precious stones, 
in tocknynge of his nobley 
and his myght. 
Prester John dwelleth 
at the cité of Suse, 
and ther is his chief palays. 
And above the chief tour beth two pomelles 
of goolde all rounde, 
and eyther of tho hath two charbocles 
gret and large 
that shyneth ryght 
cleer uppon the nyght. 
And the chief gates of that palays beth of precious stones 
that men calle sardyn, 
and the bordure of barres beth of yvour, 
and the wyndowes of the halle and chamber of cristal. 
And the tables which they ete uppon beth of emeraudes somme, 
and som of mastyk, 
and somme of goold 
and other precious stones. 
And the pelers 
that bereth these tables 
beth also of precious stones. 
And the greces 
uppon the which he goth 
to his mete 
and to his sege 
wher he sitteth, 
oon is of mastyk, 
another of cristal, 
another of [fol. 55r] jaspe, 
and other precious stones. 
And alle the greces ben y-bordured 
with fyne goolde 
and wel y-dyght 
with gret pyleres and precious stones. 
The pylers in the chambre beth of fyne goold 
with many charbocles that geveth gret lyght, 
and ther brenneth 
also in his cham bre every nyght 12 gret vesselles of cristal ful of baume, 
to geve good smel in the chambre. 
The forme of his bed 
is ful of safyres 
and wel y-boonde with goolde, 
to make hym slepe wel 
and to destruye lecherye. 
For he wole noght lye 
by his wyves 
but thries in the yer, 
and all for getyng of children. 
ARAY OF THE COURT OF PRESTER JOHN. 
CAPITULUM VICESIMUM PRIMUM. [Chapter 21.] 
Also he hath a faire palays 
at the cité of Nyse, 
wher he dwelleth when hym liketh. 
And he hath every day 
in his court 
mo than 30,000 persones, 
withoute stran- gers 
that cometh and gooth. 
But 30,000 ther is, 
and in the coort of the Gret Chane of Cathay 
spendeth noght 
so moche as hys doth, 
for 12,000 men he hath evermore. 
And he hath 7 kynges 
in his court 
to serve hym 
and every of ham serveth a monthe aboute. 
And with every kyng serveth every day 72 dukes and 300 erles. 
And every day eteth in his court 12 erchebysshoppes 
and 12 other bysshoppes. 
The patriarke of Seynt Thomas is as he were a pope 
and erchebysshop, 
bysshop, and abbot, 
and ther beth alle the kynges. 
And som of these lordes 
ben maistres of the halle, 
and som of chambre, 
som stywardes, som marchalles, 
and som other offecers, 
and therfore he is ful ryal. 
In this lond 
was somtyme a ryche man 
that men called Catholonabeus, 
and he had a fayre castel 
uppon an hylle and a strong. 
And he had y-lete make a good walle 
all aboute the hille, 
and withynne was a fair gardeyn 
in which were many fair trees 
beryng all maner fruyt that he myghte fynde. 
And he let plante therynne 
of alle maner herbes 
and of good smel. 
And ther were many fayre [fol. 55v] welles therby, 
and by hem were y-maked many fayre halles and chambres, 
wel y-dyght with goold and asure. 
And he hadde y-leet make bryddes and beestis 
that turned aboute 
by gynne in an orlage, 
and songe as they had be quyke. 
And he had in his gardeynes 
may dens of 15 yer olde, 
the fairest that he myghte fynde, 
and knave children of the same elde, 
and they were clothed in clothes of goolde 
and he sayde that thay were angeles. 
And he had y-maked a condite under erthe 
so that when he wolde, 
that condyte shold renne 
somtyme mylke, 
somtyme wyne, 
and somtyme hony. 
And this place is called Paradis. 
And when any yong bacheler 
of that contré, 
knyght other squyer, 
cometh to hym 
for to solacy hym and disporte hym, 
he ledith hym 
into his Paradis 
and showeth hym 
all these diverse thynges 
and his damyselles and hys welles, 
and he dyd smyte hys instrumentz of musyke 
in a heye tour 
that may noght be seye, 
and he seyde they were angeles of God and that place is Paradys 
that God graunted to hym that beleved, 
when He sayde thus: 
Dabo vobis terram fluentem lac et mel. 
That is to say: 
"I shal gyve yow londe flowyng mylke and hony." 
And a lytel fro that place, 
on the lyft syde 
by the ryver of Fison, 
is a gret mer vayle. 
Ther is a valeye 
bytwyxte two hilles 
that is 4 myle long. 
Som men calle hit the Valeye Enchaunted, 
and som men calle hit the Valey of Fendes, 
and som men calle hit the Valey Perlous. 
And that valey beth many gret tempestes and gret noyses and thondres every day and every nyght. 
This valey is all full of develes 
and hath y-be allway. 
And men say ther that hit 
is an entré to Helle. 
In this valey is moche goold and sylver, 
wherfore many Cristen men 
and other gooth theder for covetyse, 
to have of that goold and sylver. 
But fewe of hem cometh out agayn, 
for they beth anoon astrangled [fol. 56r] with fendes. 
And in the myddel of that valeye 
uppon a roch 
is a visage 
and the heed of the devel bodylich, 
ryght hydous and dredful to se. 
And ther is nothyng y-sene 
but the hede to the shuldres, 
but ther is no man in the worlde, 
Cristen ne other, 
so hardy but that he sholde have gret drede to se hit. 
And his eyen beth so staryng and sprynclynge of fire 
of diverse coloures 
and he chaungeth 
so ofte his contenaunce 
that no man der come nye hym 
for all the worldes good. 
And out of his mouth 
and his nose cometh 
gret plenté of fyre. 
But alway a good Cristen man 
that is stable in his feith 
may go thorghout 
that valey wel ynow withoute harme, 
if he be clene y- shryve 
and blesse hym 
with the signe of the crosse. 
And when my felawes and Y were in that valey 
we had ful gret drede 
and som of myn felawes 
acorded to go that way and som noght. 
And ther were in oure company 
2 freres menoures of Lumbardye, 
and they sayde if eny of us wolde go 
theryn they wolde also. 
And then uppon trist of hem 
we sayde that we wolde go. 
And we leet synge a Messe, 
and were y-shryve and houseled, 
and so went we yn 14. 
And when we come out we were but 10, 
and wiste noght 
whoder oure felawes 
were y-lost other turned agen, 
for we saw no more of hem. 
And som of oure felawes 
that wolde noght go 
yn with us went aboute by another way 
and were ther byfore us. 
And we say many wonder syghtes 
in that valey: 
goold, sylver, precious stones, 
gret plenté 
as us thoughte. 
But whether hit was 
as we semed we wyte noght, 
for Y touched none. 
For the fendes beth so sotel 
that they make many tyme thynges to seme other then they ben. 
And we were ofte y-cast adoun 
into the erthe 
with wynde and thondre and tempestes. 
But God halpe us alway and so [fol. 56v] 
that we passed thorgh the valey withoute harm, 
thanked be Our Lord God. 
And byyonde that valey is a gret ile 
wher that peple ben 
as gret as gyauntes 
of 28 other 30 foot longe. 
And they have no clothyng 
but beestes skynnes. 
And tho ete no breed 
but raw flessh, 
and drynketh mylke, 
and they eteth gladloker flessh 
of men than of other. 
And men sayde that byyonde that yle was another yle 
wher beth gretter gyauntz, 
for they beth of 45 other 50 foot longe, 
and som seyde of 50 cubites longe, 
but Y sey hem noght. 
And another ile is ther 
wher ben wicked 
and lither wymmen. 
And tho have stones in her eyen, 
and tho han soch a kynde 
that if they byholdeth any man with wrathe, 
they sleeth hym 
with her lokynge. 
Another ile is ther of faire peple, 
wher the custome is soche 
that the ferste nyght 
that they ben y-wedded 
they telleth 
that hit is y-ordeyned therto a man, 
and let hym lye 
by her wyves 
to have her maydenhode. 
And they geve hym gret hire for his travayle. 
And thilke men ben called gadlybyriens. 
For men of that contré holden hit a gret peryle 
to have a wommanis maydenhod. 
And if hit be so 
that her hos bande fynde her a mayde 
when he cometh to her, 
the hosband shal playne hym 
to the lawe 
that he hath noght do his dever, 
and he shal be gryvouslich pursued. 
After oon nyght they kepen her wyves well, 
that they speke noght with thilke man. And Y asked 
what was the cause 
why they had that costome, 
and they seyde somtyme men lay 
by her wyves ferst, 
and som of tho wyves had eddres in her bodies 
that touched her hosbandes 
yerd in her bodyes. 
So were many men slayn. 
Therfore leet thay other men 
have her maydenhode 
for drede of deth, 
or thei put hemself in aventure. 
Another ile is ther 
wher they chesen the kyng 
and they chesen hym noght 
for his ry[fol. 57r]chesse ne for his nobleye, 
but he that is of good condiciouns 
and most ryghtwys and trywest to juge every man 
of his trespas, 
litel other mochel, riche other poore. 
And that kyng may do no man 
to deth withoute conseil 
of his barons 
and that they alle be assent therto. 
And if hit be 
so that the kyng do a gret trespas, 
as to sle a man other soch another, 
he shal be dede. 
But he shal noght be slayne, 
but they shal defende and forbede 
that no man be so hardy 
to make hym com panye, 
and nother speke with hym, 
nother come to hym, 
ne gyve hym no mete ne drynke, 
and thus he shal deighe. 
In this lond and many other of Inde 
beth many cocthrylles, 
that is a maner of a long eddre. 
And on the nyght they dwell in wateres, 
and uppon the day 
in the londe amonge roches. 
These eddres sleeth men 
and eteth hem gryntynge, 
and they have no tonge. 
In this contré and many other, 
they sowen the seed of coton every yer. 
And hit groweth as hit 
were smale trees 
and bereth coton. 
In Arabye beth many bryddes 
and som men callen hem gyrsaunt, 
that is a wel fayr beest, 
and hit is heyer 
than a gret courser other a stede, 
but his necke is neygh 20 cubites longe, 
and his cruper 
and his tayle 
is lyke to an hert 
and he may loke over an high hous. 
And ther beth many camelions, 
that is a lytel beest 
that eteth ne drynketh never. 
And he changeth his coloures ofte, 
for somtyme he is of oo colour 
and somtyme of another. 
And he may chaunge hym 
into alle colouris 
but blak and reed. 
And ther beth many wilde swyn 
of many colouris, 
and as gret as an oxe, and hy beth all splotted 
as hit were founes. 
And ther beth lyons al white, 
and ther beth other beestes 
as gret as stedes 
that men callen [fol. 57v] lonhorauns, 
and som men callen hem tontys. 
And they beth blake, 
and they have 3 long hornes 
in her front 
as sheryng 
as a sharp swerd, 
and he chasseth 
and sleeth the olyfaunt. 
And ther beth many other beestes. 
And ther is another gret ile 
and plenteuous 
where beth good men 
and trywe 
and of good lyff 
after her feith. 
And though they be noght Cristen, 
yit of lawe of kynde 
they beth full of good vertues. 
And they fleeth alle vices of synnes and of malis, 
for they beth noght envyous, 
ne proute, ne covetous, 
ne glotons, 
nother lechours. 
And they do to no man 
but as they wolde they dede to hym. 
And they fulfelleth the 10 Commaundementes. 
They make noon fors of no rychesse. 
They swereth noght 
but ye and nay, 
for they say tho that swereth, 
he wole bygyle his neyghbore. 
And som calle this ile Bragme, 
and som men calle hit the Ile of Feith. 
And thorgh this yle renneth a gret ryver, the which men calle Tebe. 
And gen erallich alle men 
in this yle 
and other neygh beth ryght trewe, 
and trewer and ryghtwyser 
than in another contré. 
In this ile ben none thefes, 
none morthereres, 
nother comen wymmen, 
no lechoures, 
ne beggeres. 
And for they beth so trywe and so good, 
ther is no tempest, 
ne no werre, no hunger, 
ne none other tribulacioun. 
And so hit semeth 
wel that God loveth hem, 
and that He is wel apayed of her levynge. 
And they leven so honestly 
in mete and drynke 
that they lyven ryght longe, 
and many of hem deyen withoute sycknesse, 
for kynde fayleth hem for ylde. 
And Kyng Alisaundre sende somtyme thider 
for to wynne that londe, 
and they sende hym letteres agayn and seyde thus: 
"What is ynow to a man 
that all the worlde 
may noght suffyse? 
Thow shalt fynde nothyng in us 
why thow sholdest werre on us, 
when we have no rychesse nother tresour, 
and all the catel and goodes [fol. 58r] 
of our contré ben in comune. 
Our mete and our drynke 
is our tresour and ryches ses. 
And instede of goold and sylver, 
we have pees and acorde and good lyff alone. 
And we have but oon cloth uppon us, 
and our wyves beth noght 
araed rychely 
to pleysyng of men, 
for we hold hit a gret foly a man 
to dyght his body 
to make hym seme 
fayrere than hit is. 
We have evermore y-be in pees 
til now 
that thow wylt desert us. 
We have a kyng among us, 
noght for lawe 
ne for demyng of no man, 
for ther is no trespas among us, 
but al onlich to lere us 
and to be obedient to hym. 
And so myght thow noght take noght fro us 
but our good pees." 
And when Kyng Alisaunder saw this letter, 
he thoughte that he sholde do moche harm 
if he sturbled hem, 
and so he sende to hem 
that they sholde kepe 
wel her good maners 
and have no drede of hym. 
Another ile ther is 
that is y-called Synople, 
wher also beth good peple 
and trywe 
and ful of good feith, 
and beth moch lyke of lyveng 
to the peple byforesayde. 
And they goth all naked. 
And into that ile com Kyng Alisaundre, 
and when he saw her good feith and trywe, he sayde he wolde do hem no harme, 
and bade hem asken of hym 
what they wolde have. 
And they answered 
that they had rychesse ynow 
when they had mete and drynke 
to susteyne her bodyes. 
And they seyde the rychesse of the worlde is noght worth. 
But if hit were so 
that he myght graunte hem 
that they sholde never deye, 
of that they wolde pray hym. 
And Kyng Alis aundre seyde he myght noght do that, 
for he was dedelych hymself 
and sholde deye 
as they sholde. 
Then sayde they, 
"Why art thow so proute and woldest wynne all the worlde 
and have in thyn subjeccioun 
as hit were a god, 
and thow hast no terme [fol. 58v] of thyn lyf? 
And thow wolt have all the rychasse of the worlde, 
which shal forsake thee 
or thow forsake hit. 
And thow shalt bere noght with thee, 
but hit shal by leve byhynde thee to other. 
But as thow were y-bore naked, 
thow shalt be y-do yn erthe." 
And so Kyng Alisaundre 
was gretly astoned of this aunswer. 
Although hit be so 
that they have noght 
alle the articles of our feith, yit Y trowe that God love hem neverthelasse 
for her good purpoos, 
and that they take her the same degré 
as He dide of Jope 
that was a paynem, 
the which He helde hym 
for His triwe servaunt, 
and many other. 
And Y trowe that God loveth all thilke 
that loveth Hym and serveth Hym meckly and trywly, 
and despised vaynglory 
of the worlde 
as thes men dide, 
and as Jope dyde. 
And therfor Our Lord saeth thus: 
Ponam eis multiplices leges meas. 
That is to say: 
"I shal put to hem my lawes manyfold." 
And the godespell saeth thus: 
Alias oves habeo que non sunt ex hoc ovili. 
That is to say: 
"I have other sheep 
that beth noght of this foold." 
And therto acordeth a visioun of Seynt Petre 
which he saw at Japhe, 
when the angel com fro Hevene 
and brought with hym 
of alle maner of beestis, eddres, and briddes, 
and seyde to Seynt Petre, 
"Tak and ete." 
And Petre sayde, 
"I ate never of bestes unclene." 
And tho the angel saide thus: 
Non dicas inmunda que deus mundavit. 
That is to say: 
"Calle thow noght thilke thinges unclene which God hath 
clensed." 
This was y-do in tocknyng 
that men sholde have no man in dispite 
for hire diverse lyvenge, 
for we wyteth noght 
wham God loveth most, 
and wham he hateth most. 
And another ile is ther 
which they calle Pytan. 
Men of this ile tylyeth no corn lond, 
for they [fol. 59r] ete noght. 
And they ben smale men, 
but noght so smale as ben pigmans. 
These men lyven 
with the smel 
and savour of wild apples. 
And when they goth fer 
out of contré 
they berith apples with hem, 
for also sone as they leveth the savour of the apples they deye. 
And they ben noght ful resonable, 
but as bestes. 
And then is another ile 
wher the peple 
ben 
all in fetheris as bryddes, 
but the face and the palmes of her hondes. 
These men goth as well 
uppon the see 
as uppon the londe. 
And they eten flessh all raw. 
In this ile is a gret ryver 
that is two myle brod and an half, 
that men callen Ranymar. 
And byyende 
that is a gret wyldernesse, 
as men sayn that han be ther, 
in the which men sayn ben trees of the sonne 
and of the mone 
that spake to Kyng Alisaundre 
and told hym of his dedes. 
And men sayn that peple 
that kepith thes trees 
and eteth of the fruyt, 
they lyven 400 other 500 yeres, 
thorgh myght of that fruyt. 
And we wold have go theder, 
but Y trowe a hundred thousand men 
of armes sholde noght passe 
that wyldernesse for wylde bestes, 
as dragones and other. 
In this yle beth many olyfauntz white 
and blew withoute nombre, unicornes, and lyons of many coloures. 
Many other yles beth in the lond of Prester John that were to longe to telle, 
and ther is myche rychesse 
and many precious stones. 
WHY HE IS Y-CLIPED PRESTER JOHN. 
CAPITULUM VICESIMUM SECUNDUM. [Chapter 22.] 
I trowe som of yow have y-herd telle 
whi he is y-called Prester John, 
but for tho that wyte noght, 
Y shal say. 
Ther was somtyme an emperour 
that was a noble prince 
and a doughty, 
and he hadde many Cristen knyghtes with hym. 
And this emperour thought he wolde y-se the maner of Cristen men 
and the servise in cherche of Cristen men. 
And tho was Cristendome and Cristen cherches in Tur- kye, Surry, Tartarye, Jerusalem, Palestyne, Araby, 
and [fol. 59v] 
all the lond of Egypte. 
And this emperour come with a Cristen knyght 
into a cherche of Egipte 
uppon the Saturday 
uppon Witsoneday, 
when the bysshope makyde orders, 
and he byheld the servise. 
And he asked of the knyght 
what peple tho sholde be 
that stood byfore the bysshope. 
And the knyght seyde tho sholde be prestes. 
And tho he seyde he wolde no more 
be called "kyng," ne 
"emperour," but "prest." 
And also he wolde have the name of hym 
that come out ferst 
at the dore of the prestes, 
which man was y-called John. 
And so he wold be called "Prester John," 
and so haveth all the emperoures sithe be y-called. 
In that lond ben Cristen men of good feith, 
and they have prestes to syng her Masse, 
and they make her sacrament 
as men of Grece doth. 
But they say noght 
so many thinges 
as our prestes doth, 
for they say noght 
but as the aposteles, 
Seynt Petre and Seynt Thomas and other, sayde. 
When they synge Messes, 
they seith ferst Pater Noster 
and the wordes which Goddes body is makid with. For we have many addiciouns 
which that popes han y-ordeynd, 
which men of that contré know- eth noght. 
And more estward beth two yles. 
That oon is y-called Orrel 
and that other is y- called Argete, 
of wham all the lond 
is myne of goold and sylver. 
In this ile men may se none sterres 
cler shynyng 
but a sterre 
that is y-called Canapos. 
And ther men may noght se the mone 
but in the laste quarter. 
In that ile is a gret hille of goold 
that pismeres kepeth, 
and they fynyth the goold. And the pismeres beth as gret as houndes her, 
so that no man may come ther 
for drede of hem, 
so that men may gete of that goolde 
but by queyntise. 
Therfore when hit is ryght warme 
tho pismeres hideth hem 
in the erthe 
fro undre of the day to none, 
and then [Pynson] men 
of the countré take camellys and dromaderyes 
and other bestes, 
and goo theder and charge theym with golde 
and go awey fast 
or the pyssmyres come oute of the erthe. 
And other tymes 
whan it is nat so hote, 
that the pissmyres hyde them nat, they take meres 
that have foles, 
and they lay upon these meres two vesselles 
as it were two smale barelis tome 
and the mouthe upwardes 
and dryve theym theder, 
and holden their foles at home. 
And whan the pyssmyres 
sene theyse vesselles, 
for they have of kynde 
to leve nothynge tome, 
they fylle these vesselles of golde. 
And whan men trowe that the vesselles ar full, 
they take the foles 
and brynge theym as nere as they dare, 
and they whyne 
and the meres here theym. 
And as sone they come 
to ther foles, 
and so men take the gold so than. 
For these pyssemyres woll suffre bestes to goo 
amonge theym but no men. 
Beyonde the iles of the lond of Prester John 
and his lordship of wyldernesse, 
to goo right est men 
shall nat fynde but hylles, great roches, 
and other myrke londe 
where no man may see 
on day ne on nyght, 
as men of the countré say. 
And this wyldernes 
and myrke londe lasteth 
to Paradyse Terrestre 
where Adam and Eve were sette, 
but they were there 
but a lytell whyle. 
And that is towarde the est 
at be- gynnynge of the erthe, but that is nat oure 
est that we call where the sonne rysethe 
in those countrees towarde Paradyse. 
Than it is mydnight 
in oure countré, 
for the roundnesse of the erthe. 
For Oure Lord made the erthe all rounde 
in myddes of firmament. 
Of Paradyse can I nat speke propirly 
for I have nat be there, 
and that angoreth me. 
But that I have herde 
I shal say you. 
Men say that Paradyse Terrestre 
is the hyghest londe of the worlde, 
and it is so high 
that it toucheth nere 
to the sercle of the mone, 
for it is so highe 
that Noes flode 
myght nat come therto, 
the whyche covered all the erthe aboute. 
And this Paradyse Terrestre 
is enclosed all aboute with a walle, 
and that wall is all covered with mosse, 
as it semethe that men may se no stone 
ne nothynge ellis 
wherof it is. 
And the hyghest place of Paradyse, 
in the mydes of it, 
is one wall 
that casteth oute the foure flodes 
that renne thorowe dyvers londes. 
The first flode is called Physon or Ganges, 
and that renneth thorough Ynde. 
In that ryver are many precious stones 
and moche lignum aloes and gravell of golde. 
Another is called Nylus or Gyron, 
and that rennethe thorough Ethiope and Egypt. 
The thirde is called Tygre, 
and that renneth thorough Assary and Er- mony the Grete. 
And the forth is called Eufrates, 
that rennethe thorough Ermony and Persy. 
And men say that all the swete and fresshe water of the world 
take theyr springynge of theym. 
The first ryver is called Physon: 
that is to say a gaderynge of many ryvers 
togeder and falle into that ryver. 
And som call it Canges, 
for a kynge 
that was in Ynde that men called Tangeras, 
for it renneth thorough hys lond. 
And this ryvere is in som place clere, 
in som place troble, 
in som place hote, 
in som place colde. 
The secounde ryvere is called Nylus or Gyron, 
for it is ever troble. 
For Gyron is to say "troble." 
The third ryver is called Tygris. 
That is to say "fast 
rennynge," 
for it renneth faster than any of the other, 
and so is a best 
that men call tygrys 
for he renneth fast. 
The forth ryver is called Eufrates, 
that is to say "well 
brennynge," 
for there groweth many gode thynges upon the ryver. 
And ye shall understonde 
that no man lyvynge may go 
unto that Paradyse. 
For by land he may nat go 
for wylde bestes 
which ar in the wyldernes, 
and for hylles and roches 
where no man may passe. 
Ne by those ryvers may no man passe, 
for they come with so greate course 
and so great wawes 
that no shyp may go 
ne sayle ageyne theym. 
Many greate lordes have asayed many tymes to go 
by those ryvers to Paradyse, 
but they myght nat spede in their wey. 
For som dyed for wery of rowynge, 
som wex blynde, 
and som deefe for noyse of the waters. 
So no man may passe there 
but thorough special grace of God. 
And for I can tell you 
no more of that place 
I shall say you 
of that 
I have sene in these Iles 
of the londe of Prester John, 
and they ar under the erthe to us. 
And other iles ar there, 
whoso wolde pursue them, 
for to environ the erthe 
whoso had grace of God 
to holde the wey, 
he myght come right too 
the same countrees 
that he were come of and come fro, 
and so go aboute the erthe. 
And for it were to longe tyme 
and also many perylles too pas, 
fewe men assay to go so, 
and yet might be done. 
And therfore men came 
fro these iles 
to other iles 
coostynge of the lordshyp of Prester John. 
And men come in the comynge 
to one ile 
that men call Cassoy. 
And that countré is nere sexty journes longe, 
and more than 50 of brede. 
That is the best londe 
that is in those countrees save Chatay. 
And if marchauntes come theder 
as comonly as they do unto Chatay 
it shuld be better than Chatay, 
for it is so thyk of cytees and townes 
that whan a man gothe oute of a cyté 
he seth as sone another on eche syde. 
There is greate plenté of spyces and other godes. 
The kynge of this yle 
is full ryche and myghty, 
and he holdeth his londe of the Great Chane, 
for that is one of the 12 provynces 
that the Greate Chane hath under hym 
withoute his owne londe. 
Fro thys Ile men goo 
to another kyngdom 
that men call Ryboth, 
and that is also under the Greate Chane. 
This is a gode countré 
and plenteuous of corne, wyne, 
and other thynges. 
Men of this londe have none houses, 
but they dwell in tentes made of tre. 
And the pryncipall cyté 
is all blacke, 
made of blake stones and whyte, 
and all the stretes are paved with suche stones. 
And in that cyté is no man 
so hardy 
to spyll blode of man ne beest, 
for worshyp of a mawmet 
that is worshypped there. 
In that cyté dwelle the pope of their lawe 
that they call Lobassy, 
and he gyveth all dignytee and benefyses that fall to the mawmet. 
And men of relygyon and men 
that have churches 
in that countré 
ar obedyente to hym 
as men ar here to the pope. 
In this Ile they have a custume thoroughe all the countré 
that whan a mans fader 
is dede 
they woll do hym greate worship. 
They send after all his frendes, 
re- ligious prestes, 
and other many, 
and they bere the body 
to an hyll 
with greate joy and myrth. 
And whan it is there the grettest prelate 
smyteth of his hede 
and layeth it upon a greate plate of golde or sylver 
and he gyveth it to his son, 
and the son takethe it too his other frendes, 
syngynge and saynge many orysons. 
And than the prestys 
and the religyous cutte [fol. 60r] 
the flessh of the body into peces 
and sayeth orisones. 
And briddes of the contré cometh thider, 
for they knoweth the custome, 
and they flieth aboute hem 
as egles 
and other briddes eteth, 
and eteth the flesshe. 
And the prestes casteth the flessh to hem, 
and they berith hit a little thenne and eteth hit. 
And as prestes in oure contré 
as her among us singes for soules 
Subvenite sancti dei, 
that is to say, 
"Helpeth Sentes of 
God," 
so thes prestes singen ther 
with heye vois in her langage, 
"Byholdeth how good a man this was, 
that angels of God cometh to fecche hym 
and berith hym to Paradys." 
And thenketh the sone 
that he is gretly y-worshiped 
when bryddes have y-yete his fader. 
And wher beth most plenté 
of thes briddes, 
he hath most worship. 
And then cometh the sone hom 
with alle his frendes 
and maketh hem a gret feste. 
And the sone leteth make clene his fadir his heed. 
And the flessh of the heed, 
he sherith hit and yif hit 
to his moste special frendes, 
every man a litel, 
for a gret denté. 
And of the skulle of the hed the sone leteth make a coppe, 
and therof drynketh 
he al his lyfftyme 
in rememoraunce of his fader. 
And fro thenne to go 10 journeys 
thorgh the lond of the Gret Chane 
is a wel good ile 
and a gret kyngdom. 
And the kyng is ful myghty 
and he hath a ful noble lyvyng and ryche, 
after the maner of the contré. 
For he hath 50 damesels 
to serve hym every day 
at his mete and abedde, 
and doth what he wole. 
And when he sittith at the table, 
they bringeth hym his mete, 
and everi tyme fyve messes togedre, 
and singeth in the bryngyng a good song. 
And they kytteth his meete 
and put hit in his mouth, 
for he kytteth noght, 
but holdeth his hondes 
byfore hym uppon the table, 
for he hath so longe nayles 
that he may noght holde. 
And hit is a gret nobleye 
in that contré [fol. 60v] 
to have longe nayles, 
and therfore they letteth her nayles growe 
as longe as they wolleth. 
And som leteth hem growe so longe 
til they wole come 
al aboute her hondes, 
and that thenketh hem 
a gret nobley and gret gentrise. 
And the gentrise of a womman ther 
is to have smale feet, 
and therfor also sone 
as they beth y-bore, 
they byndeth her feet 
so strayt that they may noght wexe 
as they sholde. 
And this kyng hath a wel fair palays 
and a riche wher he dwelleth, 
of which the walle is two myle aboute. 
And therin beth many faire gardens. 
And all the pave- ment of the halle and chambre 
is of goold and sylver. 
And in the myddel of oon of the gardens 
is a litel hulle wheruppon 
is a litel place 
y-maked with toures and pynacles al of goold. 
And ther he wole sytte ofte 
to take the eyr and disport, 
for hit is y-maked 
for noght elles. 
Fro this lond may men go 
thorgh the lond of the Gret Chane. 
And ye shal under stonde 
that alle thes men 
that Y have spoke 
of that beth resonable haveth some ar ticles of our feith. 
And they troweth in God of kynde 
that maked all the worlde, 
and Him clipe they "God of kynde" 
as her prophecie saieth: 
Et metuant eum omnes fines terre. 
That is to say: 
"And alle eyndes of the erthe shal drede Hym." 
And in another place thus: 
Omnes gentes servient ei. 
That is to say: 
"All people shal serve to Hym." 
But they conne noght propurly speke of God 
but as her kyndely witte techith hem, 
for they spekith noght of the Sone 
nother the Holy Goost 
as they sholde do. 
But they kunne wel speke of the Bible, 
and specialich of Genesis 
and of the booke of Moyses. 
And they sayeth thes thynges 
which thei worshepith beth none godes, 
but they worshipe hem for the gret [fol. 61r] 
vertues that beth on hem, 
whiche thei say may noght be 
withoute special grace of God. 
And of simulacres and mamettes 
that they saith that alle men haveth simulacres and mamettes, 
for they saith that Cristen men haveth images of Our Lady and of other. 
But they wit noght 
that we worshipeth noght thes images of stoon nother of tre for hemself, 
but the seyntes for wham they beth y-maked. 
For as the letter techith clerkes 
how thei shal trowe, 
so images and pentours techeth lewed men 
to worshipe the seyntes for 
wham they beth y-maked. 
They saith also that the angel of God 
spekith to hem in her mametis, 
and that they doth miracles. 
They say sooth. 
They haveth an angel wythynne hem, 
but ther beth two maner of angels, 
the gode and the wickede: 
as men of Grece saith, Chaco and Calo. 
Chaco is yvel and Calo is good. 
But this is no good angel but yvel, 
that is in the mamettis to bygile hem 
and for to maynteyne hem in her mametrye. 
Ther beth many other contrees and mervayles 
which Y have noght y-seye, 
and therfor Y 
can noght speke propurly of hem. 
And also on contrees 
wher Y have y-be beth many mervailes 
of which Y speke noght, 
for hit were to longe tale. 
And also Y wole say no more 
of mervayles 
that beth ther, 
so that other men 
that wendeth theder 
may fynde many nywe thynges to say, 
of whiche Y have noght tolde nother y-spoke. 
For many man hath gret likyng and desire to hyre nywe thynges. 
And Y, John Maundevyle, knyght, 
that wente out of my contré 
and passide the see the yer of Our Lord 1332 
— and Y have y-passed thorgh many londes, contrees, and iles 
and am now come to reste — 
Y have compyled this book 
and lat write [fol. 61v] 
hit the yer of Our Lord 1366, 
at 24 yer after my departyng 
fro my contré, 
for Y was travelynge 34 yer. 
And for as moche as many man troweth noght 
but that they se with her owen eye 
other that they may conseyve with her kyndely witte, 
therfore Y maked my way 
in my tornyng homwarde to Rome 
to showe my book 
to the holy fader, the pope, 
and telle to hym mervayles whoch Y hadde y-seye in diverse contrees, 
so that he, 
with his wise consayl wolde examine hit 
with diverse peple 
that beth in Rome. 
For ther beth in Rome 
evermore men dwellynge of diverse nacions of the worlde. 
And a litel tyme after, 
when he and his conseil hadde examined hit al thorgh, 
he sayde me for certayn 
that all was soath 
that was therynne. 
For he sayde he hadde a book uppon Latyn 
that conteyned that and moch more, 
after which book the mappa mundi 
ys y-maked, 
which book he shewed to me. 
And therfore the holi fader, the pope, 
hath ratefied 
and confermed my book 
in alle poyntes. 
And Y praye to alle these 
that redith this book 
other hureth hit y-rad, 
that they wolde pray for me, 
and Y shal pray for hem. 
And alle thes 
that saith for me 
a Pater Noster and an Ave, 
that God forgif me my synnes, 
Y make hem partyners 
and graunt hem part of alle my good pilgremage and other good dedes 
that Y have do and y-wrought and do sithe 
to my lifis eynde. 
And Y pray to God, 
of wham all graces cometh, 
that He wole alle tho that redith other hureth this book 
that beth Cristen men fulfille of His grace, 
and save hem bothe body and soule, 
and brynge hem [Pynson] 
to His joy 
that ever shall last: 
He that is in the Trynyté Fader, Son, and Holy Goost, 
that lyvethe and regneth, 
God withoute ende. Amen. The Book of John Mandeville: Introduction Appendix: Sources for The Book of John Mandeville
