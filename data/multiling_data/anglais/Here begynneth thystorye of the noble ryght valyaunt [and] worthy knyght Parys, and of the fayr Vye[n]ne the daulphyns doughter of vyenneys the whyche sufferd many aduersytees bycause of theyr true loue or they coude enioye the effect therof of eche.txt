Here begynneth thystorye of the noble ryght valyaunt & wor¦thy
        knyght Parys  and of the fayr Vyēne the daulphyns dou∣ghter of
        vyennoys  the whyche suffred many aduersytees by∣cause of theyr
        true loue or they coude enioye the effect therof of eche other 

IN the tyme of kynge Charles of Fraunce the yere of our lord Ihesu Cryst
MCClxxj  was in the londe of vyennoys a ryche baron daulphyn and lord
of the lond that was named syr Godefroy of alaunson & was of the kyn∣ges
kynrede of fraunce  the whi∣che daulphyn was ryʒt myghty and a grete
lord bothe in hauoyr and in landes  & was a ryght wyse man  in so
moche that for his grete wysedom he was moche made of  bothe of the
kynge of fraunce & of al the lordes & ba∣rons of his courte  soo that
noo thynge was doon in the sayd royame but that he was called therto  &
had to his wyf a moche fayre lady whiche cleped was dame dyane whyche
was of so grete beaulte that she was wel worthy & dygne to be named
af¦ter that fayre sterre y^t men calle dyane that appyereth & sheweth a
lytel afore the day  and also she was replenysshed of all no∣blenes &
gentylnes that a lady may or ought to haue  The sayd daulphyn thenne
and this noble lady dyane were vij yere to gy∣der wythoute yssue that
moche they desyred to haue  and prayed our lord bothe nyght & day that
they myght haue chyldren play¦saunt and redy to hys deuyne seruyce  and
our lord thorugh hys benygnyte herde theyr pray∣er  and after hys
playsyr gaf vnto them the viij yere of theyr maryage a ryght fayr
doughter for the whyche  grete gladnes •• Ioye was made thorugh all the daulphyns londe  and the chylde was
baptysed with grete honour & Ioye  & in token of grete loue they named
hyr vyenne by cause the cyte where she was borne in was called vyenne 
and thys doughter was delyuerd vnto a noble lady for to be nourysshed
wyth hyr  the whyche lady was of the sayd cyte and had a ly∣tel
doughter of the age of vy∣enne the whyche was named y∣sabel  & so the
fayre vyēne was nourysshed wyth the same ysabel from hyr tender age vnto
many yere after  & soo grete loue was bytwene them bothe that they
called eche other systers  & the fayre vyenne grewe and encrea∣••ed euer in souerayn beawte & gentylnesse  so that the renomee of hyr
excellent beawte flourys∣shed not onely thurgh al fraūce but also thurgh
al the Royame


      

of englond & other contrees  It happed after she was xv yere of age
that she was desyred to ma¦ryage of many knyʒtes & grete lordes  & at
that tyme was in the daulphyns courte emonge many hys knyʒtes  a noble
mā of auncyent lygnage & of fayr londes  the whiche was wel by∣loued of
the daulphyn & of alle the lordes of the lande and was called syr
Iames  thys noble man had a moche fayr sone that had to name Parys  &
hys fa∣der made hym to be taught in al good custommes  and whan he was
xviij yere of age he was a∣dressed to the dyscyplyne of ar∣mes  &
demened hym self so no∣bly & worthely in al maner de∣des of chyualrye
that wythin a shorte tyme after he was doubed knyght by the hande of the
sayd lord daulphyn  Noo fayte of knyghthode ne none aduenture of
chyualrye happed after but that he founde hym self at it in soo moche
that the renommee of hym ranne thurgh al the world & men sayd he was one
of the best knyʒtes y^t myght be founde in ony contree  & helde hym
self ryght clene in armes and lyued chastly & Ioyefully  & had euer
aboute hym fowles hawkes and houndes for hys dysporte to alle maner of
huntyng suffysaunt y∣nough for a duc or for an erle  and thurgh hys
prowesse and hardynes he was acqueynted & knowen of many other grete
lor¦des  and emonge alle other he was gretely and louyngly ac∣queynted
with a yonge knyght of the cyte of vyenne that hyght Edward  and were
bothe of one age and moche loued eche other  and as two brethern of
armes wente euer to gyder there as they knewe ony Ioustyng or appertyse
of armes to be had for to gete honour  And wete it wel that besyde
theyr worthynes in armes they were good mu∣sycyens playeng vpon alle
ma∣ner Instrumentes of musyke  and coude synge veray wel  but Parys
passed in al ponytes his felowe Edward  Notwythston¦dyng Edward was
amerous al redy of a noble lady of the courte of braban  but Parys as
yet knewe nought of amorouste but not longe after Venus the goddes of
loue fyred his thouʒt with the hert vnto a noble yong lady  that is to
wete the fayre vyenne the daulphyns doughter of vyennoys that was his
lyege lord  & the more he growed tow∣ard his flouryng age y^e more he
was esprysed & brennyng of her loue for the grrte beaute y^t was in
hyr  But Parys thought euer in hys herte that this loue was not wel
lykly ne cordable  For he was not of so hyghe lygnage as the noble mayden


      

vyenne was of  & therfore Pa∣rys kept hys loue secrete that none shold
perceyue it sauf Ed∣ward his trusty felowe to whom he brake & shewed his
counceyl And the fayre vyenne perceyued not that parys was amerous of
hyr  nor parys also durst ney∣ther shewe nor say nothynge to hyr of
hyt  but the more that he sawe hyr the more grewe y^e fyre of loue
within hym self 


        How Parys and Edward hys felowe played wyth dyuers Instrumētes
        by nyght tofore the chambre of vyenne 

PArys thenne & edward wyth one accorde dyspo¦sed them self for to gyue
somme melodyous myrthe to the noble mayde vyenne  and wyth theyr
musycal Instrumentes  as recourders  they yede by nyght tyme to gyder
toward that parte of the castel where as the fayre vyenne laye in hyr
chambre  and there they sange ful swetely and sowned melodyously theyr
mu∣sycal Instrumentes and pypes  and certeyn the melodye of their
songes and the sowne of theyr Instrument was so playsaunt & so swete
that it passed al other melodye  And whan the daul∣phyn and his wyf &
the fayre vyenne theyr doughter herde this swete and melodyous sowne 
as wel of mās wyces as of dy¦uers Instrumētes they had grete Ioye and
took grete playsyr at it & had grete desyre to knowe what they were that
so grete so∣lace and Ioye made tofore theyr castel  and for to wete &
knowe what they were the daulphyn assygned a day of a feste at the
whyche he sente for alle maner mynstrellys in hys londe  char∣gyng
theym vpon grete payne that they shold come for to playe before hym and
hys barons in hys castel of vyenne  & ••ohan they were al come they played and sange in theyr best wyse  but ••mong them were not foūde tho mynstrelles that the lord daul¦phyn sought
fore  wherof he was sorouful & desyred more to kno∣we what they were
than he dyd afore  And whan vyenne herde alle the mynstrellys of the
bonde that sowned at y^e feste she sayd to ysabel hyr damoysel & preuy
felowe  by my fayth swete syster these mynstrellys playen nouʒt to the
regarde of them that were wonte to come before our cham∣bre  & me
dysplayseth moche that I may not knowe them  for cer∣teynly they come
not hyther for nought  for they loue outher you or me 

WHan the daulphyn vn∣derstode hys doughters wordes he wyllyng to playse
hyr sayd vnto hyr that yf it were possyble she shold kno∣we what they
were that soo


      

sange euery nyght before hyr chambre  wherfore he ordeyned x men of
armes and commaunded them to hyde them self pryuely there as the sowne
was herde  & that they shold brynge to hym other by force or otherwyse
them that made that swete melodye  Now came the nyght that the ij yonge
knyghtes Parys & Ed∣ward that no thynge knewe of thembusshement that was
layed for them came with theyr Instru¦mentes toward the castel & there
they began to synge & sowned theyr Instrumentes so melody∣ously that
grete playsyr it was to here  & whan they had songe and wold haue
retorned thy∣der as they were come fro  the x knyghtes lepte & cam
forth and sa••••wed them curtoyslle sayeng that they nedes must come wyth them for to
speke with their lord the daulphyn  Thenne sayd Pa¦rys to them  Fayr
lordes abyde a lytel whyle  yf it playse you & of vs ye shal haue an 
ansuer Thenne wente Parys & edward a parte and spake to gyder  ye see
fayr brother sayd Parys to Edward in what party we be now and I wold not
that ye shold haue by me ony dysplay syr nor harme  but soo moche I
telle you that or I shold suffre me to be ledde tofore the daul∣phyn I
had leuer deye  therfore fayr brother aduyse we what is beste for to
do  & edward heryng parys wordes sayd  brother myn haue noo fere of no
thynge and lete vs doo as ye wyl  Thenne sayd they to the x men of
armes lordes thurgh your curtosye suf∣fre vs to retorne thyder as we
came fro  for we be at my lord the daulphyns playsyr & of all the
lordes & barons of his courte but in ony maner as for thys tyme we may
not fulfylle hys commaundement 

WHan the sayd x men of armes saw the ij knygh¦tes dysobeyssaunt  they
ansuerd to them ye shal now come to hym other wyth your wylle or by
force  and bygan to pulle oute theyr swerdes & came ayenst the two
yonge knyghtes that naked were from al armes sauf theyr swerdes and
theyr bowclers  wherwyth they couerd them and so manfully deffended
theyr bodyees that they hurte & wounded sore al the ten armed men in so
moche that they maad them alle to voyde and flee fro the place whether
they wold or not  And on the morowe erly the ten men of armes came
tofore the daulphyn alle woun∣ded and sore hurt  And they re¦counted to
hym how two yonge men onely had arayed them so and how they nedes must
flee for fere of theyr lyues 


      

wherof the daulphyn was ryght angry to see them so sore hurt & took
grete dysplaysyr of it  and thought wel that the sayd two yonge
knyghtes were of grete strengthe and vertue  wherfore he comanded an
hondred men to be redy for to espye & take them the nyght folowyng yf
they came a∣geyn chargyng that none hurte shold be doon to them  but
after theyr songe doon  they shold be brought vnto hym  but thys
en¦terpryse came to none effect  for the two yonge knyghtes came not
ageyn but kepte alle that they had doon secrete  whan the fayre vyēne
sawe that she myʒt not knowe what these mynstrel∣lys were she thought
they were somme grete lordes that were a∣merous of hyr  & she & hyr
da∣moysel ysabel spake of none o∣ther thynge than of these myn¦strelles
and had grete playsyr to talke of them  Parys seyng he durst not say
nor shewe the grete loue that he had to the fayr vyenne  thought he
wold hyde hys courage from hyr  wherfore he took acqueyntaunce wyth the
bysshop of Saynt Laurence the whyche lerned hym holy scryp∣ture  The
daulphyn thenne seyng hys doughter ful tryste & pen∣syful for thys that
she myght not knowe the sayd mynstrelles that so melodyously played
to∣fore hyr chambre  he ordeyned a Ioustyng place wythin his cyte of
vyenne and made lystes and scaffoldes to be sette vp & sente his
herauldes in fraunce in En∣glond and in normandye to a∣nounce & shewe
vnto al knyʒtes and gentylmen that wold doo faytes of armes and of
chyual∣rye for loue of al ladyes and da¦moyselles  that the Ioustes
shold be holden the fyrst day of may  in the cyte of vyenne  And he
that shold doo best in armes  shold haue of the Daulphyns doughter a
shelde of crystalle of grete valurr  and a garlond wyth roses and
floures of fyn gold  And wete ye wel that vyenne the noble and fayr
may¦den was ryght gladde of the Ioustes that hyr fader ordeyned for hyr
sake  Fro grete talent and desyre she had to knowe hym that was soo
amerous of hyr  and she thought he wold be at the sayd fyrst day of may
at vyenne 

After the messagers that had pronounced the Ioustes were comen ageyn to
the cyte of vyenne  the moost parte of the knyghtes and gentylmen of
the Royame of Fraunce of En∣glond and of Normandye made them redy for to
come to the cyte of Vyenne to the sayd Ioustes  And in especyal many
no∣ble barons of the royame of En∣glond & of france that amerous


      

were of the fayre vyenne for the renomme of hyr grete beaulte  came to
the sayd Ioustes wyth ryche and noble araye  emonge whome was Iohan duc
of bour∣bon neuew to the kyng of fraūce Edward the kynges sone of
en¦glond  Anthony sone to the erle of prouence  Gherard the mar∣quys
sone of Mountferat  and wyllyam sone to the duc of Car∣nes  Paris
thēne knowyng this noble assemble and the Ioustes that shold be the
fyrst day of M••y thought in hym self whe∣ther he shold goo thyder or not  but the
grete loue that he had to the fayre vyenne constrayned hym therto 
Neuertheles he took counceyl of Edward his felowe the whyche answerd to
hym  yf ye goo I wyl holde you compa∣••ye thyder  but we must departe secretly that we be not knowen  and
anone they made redy theyr harnoys & pourueyed theym of good horses
whiche they harney¦sed al in whyt  & none other to∣ken they had on them
whereby they myght be knowen sauf that they were arayed al in whyt & one
lyke that other  The day of the Ioustes thēne approched & al the lordes
& barons afore sayd cam ij dayes before the feste to y^e cyte of vyenne
where the daul∣phyn for loue of them dyd doo make a noble scaffold where
as the fayre vyenne was rychely a∣rayed  & al that sawe hyr were
ameruaylled of hyr  grete beaute To that feste came many noble knyghtes
& squyers clothed and arayed rychely after the guyse of theyr contree 
& there were ma¦ny mynstrellys playeng vpon al maner Instrumentes  &
many good syngars whyche the noble mayde vyenne herkened ful wel For hyr
hert was onely sette to thynke how she myght knowe hym that was hyr
louer  parys thenne came thyder and was or¦deyned for to serue at the
daul∣phyns table where vyenne satte  & wete ye wel that ful gracy∣ously
and curtoysly he serued and kerued before hyr 


        How Parys gate the prys of the Ioustes in the cyte of Vyenne 

WHan the day was comen that the lordes knyghtes & gētylmen shold Iuste
for loue of the ladyes  Parys & Edward yede to a secrete place where
they armed them secretly and syn came to the lystes with theyr badges &
tokens and were horsed and armed ful rychely and wel  Alle other
knyghtes there were knowen by theyr ar¦mes  but the two whyt knygh∣tes
were vnknowen 

The daulphyn thenne commaun¦ded that euery one shold mustre


      

or the Ioustyng began along the felde tofore the ladyes & damoy¦selles 
and soo they mostred ry∣dyng tofore the scaffold of the fayre vyenne &
were so nobly & rychely armed & arayed  and so godely men they were
that euery one sayd  the floure of knyght∣hode may now be seen in thys
place  a emonge al other pryn∣ces Edward of Englond was moost amerous
of al & ryght re¦nōmed in armes  The pucelle Vyenne soyng alle these
noble knyghtes  sayd to hyr damoysel ysabel  Fayr syster whyche of
them al thynke you that moost dooth for the loue of me  & ysa∣bel
ansuerd  honourable lady me semeth he that bereth the lyon of gold in
his armes dooth more for your loue than the other  Certes sayd vyenne
yonder two whyt knyghtes that bere none armes in theyr sheldes are more
to my fantasye than ony of the other alwaye  we shal see now what they
can doo  Thēne were the knyghtes redy to do fayte of armes  And fyrst
an hardy & valyaunte knyght that bare in hys armes a crowne of gold
bygan the fyrst cours  & ayenst hym ranne the good knyght ed∣ward parys
felowe & recoūtred eche other so vygorously y^t they brake bothe theyr
speres  many other mette eche other sodaynlye gyuyng grete strokes 
somme were ouerthrowen to the erthe & somme brake theyr speres wor∣thely
& kept theyr sterops ryght valyauntly  the other recountred eche other
so manfully that bothe hors and man were caste to the grounde  For
euery man dyd hys best to gete worshyp there  Edward the kynges sone of
englond bare hym ful wel and had the better vpon many a knyʒt there 
but the strong knyʒt parys broched hys hors toward hym  and mette hym
so vygo∣rously that atte ende he ouer∣threwe hym & had the better of hym
wherof he gate grete wor∣shyp and was moche praysed for hys grete
prowesse  Thys Ious∣tyng lasted tyl souper tyme  & whan y^t euen cam
many of them were wery of the Iouste & rested them  but parys dyd thēne
more of armes shewyng his meruayl¦lous prowesse than he had doon of al
that day in so moche that none durst approche hym ne with stonde his
appertyse in armes  & so moche he dyd that thonour & prys of the
Ioustes rested & a∣bode in hym that day 


        How the shelde of crystal & the garlond with floures of gold
        were yeuen to Parys as to the best doer in faytes of armes 

THe feste ended  grete wor¦shyp & loenge abode to y^e ij knyʒtes with
y^e whyt


      

armes  and Parys was ledde vnto the scaffold there as vyēne was the
whyche delyuerd hym the shelde of crystal & the gar∣lond wyth floures of
gold that she helde in hyr honde  & thenne parys with Edward his felawe
departed thens in the secretest wyse that they coude and wente to v••arme them to y^e place where they fyrst armed them self  The ••••••ons and knyghtes that were there spake wel of the prowesse & of the
chyualrye of the knygh¦tes with the whyt armes so that the daulphyn &
the other grete lordes had grete desyre to knowe what they were & to
haue theyr acqu••yntaunce  but they depar∣ted so secretly fro the felde that no man
knewe where they were become nor what waye they toke

AFter al thys was thus doon the knyghtes retor¦ned in to theyr contrees
spekyng euer of the ryal feste and chere that the daulphyn had doon to
them  & of the prowesse of the whyt knyghtes & of the ryght souerayn
beaute and no∣blesse of vyenne  And in the mene whyle there moeued a
stryf betwyxte the barons & knyʒtes of Frauunce and of Englond For somme
were there that were amerous of the doughter of the duc of Normandye 
and somme were that loued and bare oute the bealute of the syster of the
kyng of Englond  sayeng she was fayrer than Vyenne was  and other were
there that helde contrarye oppynyon sayeng that the daulphyns doughter
vyenne passed in beaute al other wym∣men in the world  and for this
reason was grete debate & stryf betwyxte the knyʒtes of fraunce & them
of Englond for the beau¦te of these thre damoyselles  Euer multeplyed
& grewe more the bruyt and the renōme of the daulphyn by cause of the
Ioustes and tournoyment doon in his cyte of vyenne  wherof he had grete
Ioye  for they had be moche honourable and playsaunt to al knyghtes 
And Vyenne euer thought in hyr self who myght he be that had goten the
worshyp and prys of the Ious∣tes and sayd to ysabel  Neuer truste me
dere suster but y^e knyʒt to whom I haue yeuen the shelde of crystal and
my garlond is he that so swetely sange for the loue of me tofore our
chambre  for myn hert gyueth it me  and by my fayth syster he is ful
no∣ble and worthy  & in alle hys dedes ryght curtoys and gentyl as we
myght haue seen whylere wherfor I say you my swete sys∣ter that in hym I
haue putte the rote of myn entyere herte  my wylle and al my loue  nor
neuer I shal haue playsyr ne Ioye


      

vnto y^e tyme that I knowe what he is  for my loue is al hys  & of
what so euer estate he be of I neuer shal take myn herte fro hym 
Thenne began she to wayle and syghe for the loue of hym ful tenderly 
for tyl now she had not felte the sparkles of loue that sprange out of
hyr hert  but parys knewe nothyng herof y^t she desyred to haue hym &
to knowe what he was  but he kepte hys loue secrete in hys hert  For
he durst not shewe it vnto hyr wherfore he ledde hys lyf in grete
trystesse and sorowe he went euer in the felawshyp of the bysshop of
saynt Laurence & made semblaunte of nothyng And Iames the fader of
Pa∣rys that had seen the noble feest and the ryal Ioustes in the cy∣te
of vyenne  wenyng to hym that hys sone parys had not ben there was ful
sory & had gr••te dysplaysyr of it and sayd  Fayr sone Parys I am in a grete
ma∣lencolye & in a thought for you that ye be not so Ioyeful ne me∣ry as
ye were wonte to be  here afore tyme I sawe you euer re∣dy to the
Ioustes and to al ma∣ner faytes of chyualrye for to gete honour  & I
now see you al chaunged syn ye took ac∣queyntaunce wyth thys bysshop for
lothe I were to see you by∣come a man of relygyon as I fere he wyl
brynge you to  and ryght wrothe I am that ye were not at that noble and
ryal tour¦noyment that hath be holden in vyenne for the sake of alle the
ladyes of thys londe  wherfore dere sone I praye you to take hede to
your self that ye lese not your good renommee  your wor¦shyp ne the
praysyng also that ye gate afore tyme  and that ye spende not your
yongthe in yo••e¦nesse  And Parys heryng alle thys ansuerd noo thyng to hys fader but
abode stylle pensyf••••ll thynkyng on y^e beaute of vyēne 

NOw sayth thystorye that as ye haue herde aboue a grete stryf befyl
emong the knyghtes aforesayd for the loue of the thre damoyse••les a∣fore sayd  For the erles sone of Flaundres was gretely wrothe for
thys cause wyth the Duc of brennes and had beten & hurte sore eche other
so that none myʒt make the pees betwyxte theym  For eyther of hem
mayntened & bare oute the beaute of his lady It happed thenne that fyue
knyghtes hardy and valyaunte came forth the whyche sayd that they were
redy to fyght and for to proue by force of armes that Florye the dukes
doughter of Normandye was the fayrest da∣moysel of alle the world  And
Incontynent stert vp fyue other knyghtes that said & mayntened


      

that cou••taunce the kynges sys∣ter of englond was the fayrest  And forthwyth
other v knygh¦tes rose vp that mayntened and vphelde the beaute of
vyenne a∣boue alle other wymmen in the world in so moche that thys
de∣bute cam to the knowleche of the kyng of Fraunce whiche sayd that
herof myght growe a grete trouble and dyscorde emong his barons & other
lordes  Soo sente he worde to them that they shold come toward hym and
that he shold gyue suche a sentence vpon theyr stryf that they al shold
be therof contente  the whyche mes¦sage p••••sed them wel and came 〈◊〉〈◊〉 toward hym assone as they myght  And whan they were come tofore the
kyng they spake of theyr stryf  But anone the kyng ordeyned a Ioustes
for the lou•• of the sayd thre ladyes  & made his m••undement that they al shold co••e wyth theyr ar∣mes and hors for to Iouste the viij day of septembre in
the cyte of parys  and they that shold do best in armes at that day
they shold haue the prys & the wor∣shyp of the feste and the lady on
whos beaute they helde with shold be reputed and holden for the fayrest
damoysel of alle the world  The kyng of Fraunce thenne sente worde to
the faders of the forsayd thre ladyes pray¦eng them to come atte same
feste and that eyther of them shold brynge wyth hym a present of
rychesse the which thre presentes shold be yeuen in the worshyp of their
thre doughters to the best doer in armes in token of vycto¦rye  And
thus the kyng of en∣glond fyrst sent for hys syster Constau••ce a fayre crowne of gold alle sette wyth perlys and precyous stones of
grete value  The duc of Normandye for loue of hys doughter Florye sente
a ryght fayre garlond sette wyth dyuers perlys & precyous sto∣nes moche
ryche and of grete extymacyon  And the daulphyn for loue of hys
doughter vyenne sente a moche ryche coler of gold al enuyronned wyth
precyous stones of, dyuers colours  the whiche was worth a ryght grete
tresour  And these thre Iewel∣lys were delyuerd to the kynge of
Fraunce  The forsayd knygh¦tes thenne made them redy and apparaylled al
thynges accor∣dyng to the Ioustes  & in ryche araye came al to the cyte
of Pa¦rys  and wete ye wel that in Fraunce was not seen afore that day
so grete noblesse of barons and knyghtes as were there as¦sembled  for
there were the moost hye prynces & barons of englond of Fraunce and of
Normandye and eyther of them dyd sette al hys wytte and en••endement to vpholde and bere oute that they


      

had purposed and sayd  and euery baron gaf hys lyuerey that they shold
be knowen eche fro other  & the bruyt & renōme was that my lady
constaunce shold haue thonour of that feste for thys that many a fayre
and hardy knyght made them redy to mayntene the quarelle of hyr
beaulte  but neuertheles eyther of these thre partyes hoped to haue the
worshyp of the feste  & parys that was in vyenne the cyte  and that
wel knewe the grete apparaylle of thys feste  took counceyl of Edward
hys felawe whether he shold goo to parys or not  And Edward counceylled
hym to goo thyder  so that he wente secretly  & sayd yf ye goo thyder
secretly and yf god gyue you grace that ye gete the worshyp of the
feste  grete wele & good shal come to you therby  and yf ye goo and be
knowen the. daulphyn and the other lordes shal not preyse you soo moche
as they shold yf ye were vnknowen for cause that ye be not of so grete
lygnage as they be  another is yf ye goo o∣penl̄y and that my lady
vyenne happeth to haue thonour of the feste by your prowesse  she shal
nought be sette by  consyderyng the other grete lordes that shal be
there procedyng your degree  & yf she gete the worshyp of the feste by
a knyght vnknowen the loue and honour shal growe the more in hyr courage
toward hym that thus hath doon for hyr sake  wherfore I counceyl you to
goo thyder in the moost secretest wyse that ye may  for my truste is
that ye shal gete grete wor∣shyp there  and but yf ye goo  truste me I
shal make my self redy to goo thyder for you  For I wyl be lothe to s••e the beaulte of my lady vyēne to be rebuked At these wordes graunted
Pa∣rys to goo to the sayd Ioustes  and whan he was redy & ha•••• al thynges accordyng to a no∣ble knyght he departed in the se∣cretest
manere that he myght to∣ward the cyte of parys wh••re as the kyng of Fraunce maad grete prouysyon of alle maner metes and
of al other thynges necessarye to suche a ryal fe••te  And in the myddes of the cyte of parys he ordeyned the place where
the knyghtes shold Iouste and dyd doo make many fayre scaffoldes for the
ladyes and da¦moyselles to be sette on  for to be holde the Ioustyng 
Also he dyd do make thre baners ful fayre and ryche  the fyrst baner
was whyt  and there was wryton vpon hit in letters of gold  vy∣enne

felde  and wete ye that so grete prees was there that the peple took
theyr place vpon the scaffoldes ij dayes afore the feste for to see the
grete peple & the fayr ordynaunce that there was 

WHan it was so that the lordes were redy of alle ••hynges that were ne∣cessarye  and were departed fro theyr contrees they
assembled al at parys the xiiij day of septem¦bre  and neuer tofore was
seen so grete a companye of nobles  For fro alle partyes was comen
grete chyualrye  the sōme for to do armes  and the other for to see
the feste whyche was moche sumptuous and noble  & whan the day assygned

merueillously for the nombre of perles & precyous stones that were in
the baners  Now it shold be ouerlonge to recyte of the barons and of
the knyghtes that were in that Iour¦neye  For many were comen thy¦der
fro the royame of spayne  of aragon and of many other con¦trees for to
proue their strengthe and persones  and for to mayn¦tene the barons that m••yntened the thre ladyes maydens  Of whome we shall reherce of the

prys and thonour of the feste  and that lady or da∣moysel shal be
mayntened and allowed for the moost fayre da∣moysel of the world  and
shal haue the prys and thonour of them of Englond of Fraunce & of
Normandye  and that to thys noo man be so hardy to gaynsay vpon the
payne to lose his lyf 


      

And yet after thys he sayd  ye see here a fayre crowne the why∣che the
quene of Fraunce hath or¦deyned  to thende that it be dely∣uerd to the
fader of the damoy∣sel that shal haue the prys and honour of the felde

mustre was made  euery baner retorned in to hys place  whyche moche
noble and meruayllous thynge was it to see and to by∣holde the noblesse
of the barons & knyghtes soo wel horsed and armed as they were  And the

& the Ioustes 


        How Parys wan the prys at the Ioustes in the cyte of Parys 

WHan thenne it came to the houre of tyerce began the Ioustes  and cam

peryl∣lous duc of Normandye  whyche smote hym wyth soo grete force that
he ouerthrewe hym vnder hys hors & brake hys arme & put hym in suche
estate that he wyst not whether it was day or nyght  and ayenst Iohan
peryl∣lous came Anthonye alegre sone of the duc of carues  and dyd so moc•••• prowesse wyth his per∣sone that he conquerd Iohan pe∣ryllous and v

And thēne came the free knyght parys a∣yenst geffroy beryng lowe hys

al to therthe  wherfor the kyng sayd  that sythe bothe two were
throwen to the erthe  that they shold retorne ageyn to the Ioustes  &
parys wyth a grete desyre consented  and soo bothe retorned & came
rennyng  And Parys gaf to geffroy so grete a stroke  that hys hors
slode and thenne geffroy ouerthrewe to the erthe  but by cause that the
hors slode it was sayd that the hors was cause that he ouerthrewe  For
moche they mayntened gef∣froy and sayd that he was not vaynquysshed  &
that it shold be wel doon that they shold Iuste ageyn  And by cause
that Pa∣rys was not knowen ther was none that mayntened hym ne
susteyned  neuertheles the kyng of fraunce knewe wel that gef∣froy was
vaynquysshed loyally & wel  For he had wel seen the aduenture  & wold
do no wronge vnto the knyght whyche was of grete strengthe and myght 
and anone sente to hym an heraulde whyche sayd to hym in the name of the
kynge of fraunce  that the kyng had wel seen & wel knewe that Parys had
vaynquysshed hys knyght  Notwythstondyng yf he wold yet ones retorne to
the Iuste by hys noblesse that he shold do hym self grete honour And
thenne Parys maad hys ansuer sayeng that the beaulte of my lady vyēne
was so grete that in al the world was none to hyr lyke  that yf it
pleased the Kyng I am redy for to


      

furnysshe the Ioustes for hys loue ayenst the knyght yet ano∣ther tyme 
and to Iuste tyl that geffroy shold be vaynquysshed  & that was
wythoute ony gayn sayeng  & the heraulde retorned and tolde it to the
kyng  whe∣rof the kyng was wel contente & sayd that the knyght ought to

retorned to the Iustes  & smote to gyder wyth soo grete myght  that by
veray force geffroy went to therthe vnder hys hors ryght euyl hurte 

THenne whan it came to∣ward euen the Ioustes were so grete thycke and
stronge that al the thre partyes as wel of one as of other were throwen
doun to the erthe  that there abode no moo of the partye of vyenne but

the felde 


        How the kyng commaunded that the thre baners wyth the in

THe Ioustes fynysshed Parys wanne the beau∣te of hys lady the fayre
vyenne  and he was ledde to the scaffolde where as the kynge was  &
the other grete lordes & knyghtes & there were delyuerd to hym the thre
baners & the thre Iewellys that were in them  & Parys shewed them
thurgh all the felde  in sygne that the sayd vyenne had goten thonour
for to be the fayrest damoysell that was in alle the world by the same
yonge knyght  and whan Parys had the thre fayr baners and the thre
ryche Iewellys  he


      

and Edward hys felowe de∣parted out of the cyte of parys and oute of
fraunce the moost secrete wyse that they myght  & retorned in to
dalphyne  Parys retorned in to the companye of the forsayd bysshop of
Saynt Laurence  as he had not been at the feste  & alwaye he
demaun∣ded tydynges of the Iustes that were made in fraunce  and who
had thonour of the Ioustes 

WHan the feste was made al the barons & knygh∣tes that were there had 〈◊〉〈◊〉 desyre to knowe who was 〈◊〉〈◊〉 that so valyauntly & so nobly 〈◊〉〈◊〉 wonne the Iourneye & the honour of the Iustes for to doo to hym
worshyp  but they coude neuer knowe hym  wherof they had grete
dysplaysyr  & sayd that the knyght was of grete wysedom  by cause he
wold not be knowen  And after this the barons & knyghtes took leue of
the kyng  and retorned in to theyr londes al dyscomforted  by cause
they had not goten the ho¦nour of the feste  and yet were they more
angry by cause they knewe not to whome the honour was gyuen of the feste
ne of the Iustes  The kyng of Fraunce whyche moche loued the dolphyn
made to hym grete feste & moche grete honour  And the kyng de¦lyuerd to
hym the crowne that the quene had gyuen  for to gyue to hyr that shold
haue the honour of the Ioustes  to thende that he shold gyue it vnto
hys doughter vyenne in sygne & to∣ken that she was the moost fayr
damoysel of the world  & whan al thys was doon  the dolphyn and the
fader of parys retorned in to dolphyne in moche grete ho¦nour and gre••e Ioye  whan vy¦enne knewe that hyr fader came she came and mette hym
as she was accustomed  Thenne whan the dolphyn sawe hyr  he kyssed hyr
& sette on her hede the crowne whyche the kynge had gyuen hym  and
tolde to hyr how she had goton the honour for to be the moost fayrest
damoysell of the world  and loo here is the fayr crowne that the quene
of fraunce sendeth to you in token that ye haue goten the honour  Not
wythstondyng fayr dough∣ter  that ye haue had many con¦trarye therto 
but ye haue had a good deffendour & ryʒt stronge and hath wel quyted hym
in your nede  For of eche partye were abyden thre knyghtes mo∣che
stronge and p••yssaunte  and on your partye was left but one knyght onely whyche
vaynquys¦shed al the other  wythout ony token  and is departed alle
se∣cretly that no man knewe hym ne the kyng of fraunce hath no knowleche
of hym  but he hath


      

borne awaye wyth hym the thre baners & the iij Iewellys that were in
them & also the prys & thonour of the feste  wherfore swete & fayr
doughter ye wote neuer to whom to gyue thankyn¦ges of so moche honour as
hath be doon for you  but I praye to god of heuen & to the glorious
vyrgyn marye  that it playse hym to gyue to hym good & ho∣nour  Ioye &
excellence & in alle his feates vyctorye  lyke as he is chyef & hede of
al honour and of al chyualrye in thys world For I neuer sawe ne herde of
knyght that so gracyously and so curtoysly bare hym in his ar∣mes & in
his chyualryes  And whan vyēne herde sp••ke of these tydynges  & sawe the grete ho∣nour & prys that she had
goten and al was comen by this noble knyght  she sayd to ysabeau hyr
damoysel  My suster sayd I not to you wel but late  that I was byloued
by the moost noble and valyaunt knyght of fraunce  & and by my fayth my
swete sus∣ter  this is he y^t so swetely songe & that wanne the Iustes
in this cyte & bare with hym the shelde of crystal & my garlonde  and
went his waye so that noo man myght knowe hym  aduyse you wel fayr
suster what hanour is comen to me by his prowesse & by his bounte  I
may wel be so∣ry & dolant  whan I may not knowe who he is  & myn herte
is moche heuy & myn entend••∣ment that I neuer can fynde the moyen to see & knowe hym  and yet she
sayd  Certes my swete suster ysabeau  I byleue that my dayes be
shorte  & that I shall deye of somme cruel & fals deth for the grete
desplaysyr that I haue contynuelly in my herte  for I can none other
thynge doo but wepe & waylle  & alwaye to contynue in sorouful lyf &
heuy but none apperceyued it but o∣nely hyr damoysel ysabeau 

THe fader of parys why∣che had ben with the dol∣phyn in that feste had
not seen there hys sone Parys  wherof he had grete sorowe in his
herte  for he had seen that he was accustomed to be in al noble
Ius¦tes  but thenne he sawe hym goo with the bysshop of saynt
Lau∣rence  and dysposed hym not to doo armes as he was woned  wherfor
he sayd to hym on a day My sone I had hoped to haue had in the grete
consolacyo••  but now thou byngest me in to grete heuynesse and dysplay∣syr  whan
I see that thou wylt not departe from thys bysshop wherfor I praye the
that y^u leue hym  & doo soo that it may be to me playsaunt and to the
hon∣neste  Parys herde hym wel  but he gaf not a word to ansuer


      

The fader of Parys seyng thys went to his secrete felowe Ed∣ward and
sayd to hym  I see wel that the grete amytye & loue that ye haue to my
sone  and knowe ye for certayn that I haue in my hert grete melancolye
whan I remembre that Parys hath had grete honour & fame of chyualrye 
and now I see that he gooth al wyth thys bys∣shop  and leteth hys
hawkes  his houndes and hors to deye for hongre  wherfore I praye you
that ye wyl gyue me somme counceyl  whyche am soo mes∣chaunt that I
deye for sorowe  And whan he had sayd these wordes  Edward had pyte of
hym  & comforted hym the beste wy••e he coude  and departed fro hym  and wente strayte to hys felowe
Parys and sayd to hym I knowe wel that loue constray¦neth the so
strongely  that thou hast noo power ouer thy self  wherfore thy lyf
may not longe endure  And also thy fader and thy frendes ben euyl
contente a∣yenst the  and I say to the that for to be vertuous and
valyaunt it playseth moche to god  And for the loue of one woman thou
doost moche desplaysyr to thy fa∣der  And also for noo persone what
someuer he or she be  thou oughtest not to lese the wele & renomee that
thou hast of chy∣ualrye  It appyereth not in the  that thou hast ouy
vertue or cou∣rage  wherfore I praye the that thou wylt do somme thyng
that it may be playsaunt to thy fader whych hath desyred & prayed me
that I shold soo say to the  whan parys had herde al this  he an∣suerd
to edward and sayd to hym  I knowe wel that these thynges that thou
hast sayd to me been vertuous & honnest  but they been to me greuous 
for to put me from the thoughtes in whyche I am contynuelly 
Ne∣uertheles I praye the that thou gyue me counceyl what is beste that I
doo  Thenne sayd edward it shold wel playse me  yf it were thy playsyr
that we shold goo in to braband  For it is vj monethes passed that I
haue not seen my lady  & there shall we do armes  by which we may gete
fame and honour  & paris agreed therto sayeng that he was contente yf
it playsed hym so to do  & Incontynent they made redy theyr harnoys &
horses and alle thynges necessarye to them  & or Parys departed he put
in hys chambre al the thynges & pryses that he had wōne by chyualryes &
closed them fast in his chābre  & delyuerd the keye to his moder &
prayed hir moche derly that she shold not open it  ne suffre y^t ony
persone shold entre therin  And after they wente toward Bra∣band 
where as they dyd grete


      

feates of chyualrye & Ioustes wherof they gate grete honoure and
worshyp  and were moche praysed of ladyes and damoy∣sellys  And parys
made coun¦tenaunce for to haue abyden in braband for the loue of edward
but hys herte drewe vnto the fayre Vyenne  whome he so mo∣che loued in
hys herte secretely 


        How Dyane and vyenne hyr doughter wenten to vysyte the fader of
        Parys the whyche was seek 

NOw it happened that du¦ryng thys tyme that Pa¦rys and Edward duel leden
in Braband  the fader of Parys fyl in to a sekenesse of foures or
accesse  And the cause came of the thought that he had of ••ys sone Parys  And he be¦yng seek the doulphyn wente on a day to see
hym  and de∣maunded the cause of hys mala¦dye  and comforted hym the
best wyse that he coude  and after re∣torned home  and sayd to hys
wyf  that it were wel doon that she shold goo see and vysyte messyre
Iaques whyche was seke  And forthwyth Inconty∣nent my lady dyane  hyr
dough∣ter Vyenne and ysabeau hyr da¦moysel wyth a grete companye wente
to the castel of Syr Ia∣ques  and salewed hym moche nobly as it wel
apperteyned  & the best wyse that they myght And whan they were in the
chambre where messyre Iaques was and laye  Dame dyane demaunded hym of
his sekenesse And messire Iaques sayd that al hys dys••ase came for hys sone Parys  by cause he loste so hys tyme  and that
he went alway wyth the bysshop of Saynt lau¦rence  wherof I fere me
that he shal become a man of relygyon  I haue no moo chyldren but hym 
I wote not what I shall doo wyth the goodes that god hath gyuen to me 
And my la∣dy dyane comforted hym and sayd that hys sone was moche wel
byloued of the doulphyn  & that he had moche grete amytye of many grete
lordes  barons & knyghtes  & also she sayd that emong al thynges he
shold or∣deyne for hys helthe  & after all thys the moder of parys
prayed hyr that it myght playse hyr to come see the castel  and she
an∣suerd that she moche desyred it Thenne the moder of parys she∣wed hir
al the castel  & ledde hir in to an halle al ful of armes and abylemens
of warre for to fyght in batayll  After she ladde hyr in to anothrr
halle where as were many hawkes  faul∣cens  and many other fowles of
chace  And after in to many


      

other halles & chambres rychely arayed whyche were ouer longe to
reherce  And after the moder of Parys shewed vnto hyr the chambre of
Parys where that he slepte  wherin were many abyl∣ments  whyche shold
wel suf∣fyse y^e chambre of a grete prynce And in the sayd chambre were
two grete standardes couerd af∣ter the guyse of Fraunce  That one was
ful of clo••he of gold and sylke  and that other of harnoys and of many other
thyn¦ges  Thenne sayd Vyenne to y••abeau  by my fayth fayr sys∣ter I haue noo grete meruaylle of th••s yonge knyght Parys though of hym be maad grete m••ncyon  For thordynaunce of thyse thynges shewe wel that he is of grete
valure  And in by∣holdyng of these thynges she sawe a couerture of an
hors alle whyte  And hyr semed that it was the same that the knyght b••re that wanne the prys of the Ioustes that was made in the cyte of
Vyenne  and that had the shelde of crystal & the gar∣lond whych she
tolde to ysabeau And ysabeau ansuerd to hyr  neuer thynke ye soo  For
all day been made semalable couertures and tokenes whyte  wherof ye may
wel be deceyued  Vyenne enforced alle waye hyr self to t••ke better hede  and of the grete Ioye that she had she sayd to hyr
moder  Madame I am a lytel crased and sodeynly taken  wher¦fore yf it
playse you I wold fayne reste a lytel in this cham¦bre  and late me be
alle allone wyth my suster ysabeau  for I wyl haue none other  and
a∣none eche body auoyded oute of the chambre  and ysabeau dyd shytte
the dore that none myght come in  Thenne sayd vyenne now we shal see
yf we may fynde ony thynge that we may haue better knowleche of  For
myn herte sayth yes  After that they had serched and vy∣syted alle the
chambre  they cam on a syde of the chambre where they fonde a lytel
dore  of why∣che henge a lytel keye by a thwonge  and anone they
ope∣ned the dore and entred therin And there was a lytel cham∣bre whyche
was xij foot longe  and was an oratorye  where as was the mageste of
our Lord Ihesu Cryst vpon a lytel aulter and at eche corner was a
can∣styke of syluer  and thyder cam Parys for to make hys sacre∣fyse
whan he aroos  and whan he wente to hys bedde 

And there were the thre ba∣ners that the noble knyght Pa∣rys had wonne
in the cyte of Parys  And the thre Iewel∣lys of the thre damoyselles
afore sayd  And in the same place was also the shelde of Crystal


      

and the garlond that Vyenne delyuerd to hym whan he wāne the prys at the
Ioustes in the cyte of vyenne  And all these he kepte secrete in that
place  And whan vyenne sawe these thyn∣ges  she was sure that Parys
was he whome she had so moche desyred to knowe  and that soo moche
honour had doon to hyr  and for the grete Ioye that she had  she sette
hyr doun on the grounde  and there abode a grete whyle  and coude not
speke a word  And after she spake to ysabeau  & sayd my swete
sys∣ter  blessyd and preysed be our lord of thys good Iourney  For me
thynketh I shold neuer de∣parte oute of thys chambre  Alas I haue so
longe abyden to knowe  who he was that so swe¦tely played in his
Instrumen∣tes so nygh vnto me  and now he is so ferre  & thenne
ysabeau began to repreue hyr and sayd to hyr  Swete lady I praye you
that ye say ne do ony thyng whi∣che myght torne you to folye  and be ye
ruled by wysedom and reason  For not wythstondyng that parys haue so
moche good & vertues  yet ye ought to consy¦der that he is not ••gal to you in lygnage ne in estate  For I knowe wel that many noble &
puyssaunt lordes haue demaun∣ded you in maryage  & loue you & do grete
thynges for you  and also thonour of Parys whyche is your vayssal and
subget is not egall ne worthy vnto you  Thenne vyenne was moche angry
on ysabeau and began to say  A veray god I am wel dyscomforted and
deceyued by the  that thus agayn sayest me of hym that I so longe haue
desyred to knowe  Alas I had supposed that in noo thyng ye wold haue
dysplaysed me  And in good fayth I say to the  that this man I wyl
loue and demaunde  and I promyse the in good fayth  that yf thou ony
more gaynsaye me I shal slee my self  and thenne thou shalt be caus•• of my deth  For I wyl not lese hym that I haue so longe loued  but I
say to the for trouthe  that yf thou euer say to me suche wordes of my
frende parys  that thou shalt neuer after haue space to say them ageyn
another tyme  for yf thou consyderest wel hys noble con∣dycyons and
custommes  thou sholdest preyse hym better than thou doost  And
knowest thou not wel that the kyng of fraūce wold that it had coste hym
half hys Royame that hys sone Lo∣wys were as valyaunte as pa∣rys is 
And also there be many notable lordes that desyre to knowe his nam••  and to haue hys amytye 

Thenne take hede and byholde by my fayth yf euer thou sawe


      

man that myght be compared to hym  certaynly alle vertues been in hym 
And sythe that fortune hath brought me to hys loue  he is worthy to

cause thēne to loue hym  whyche hath doon to me so grete good and
honour and doubtyng noo peryl of hys persone  and is it not wel grete
worshyp to my fader to haue for vaissal and subget the beste knyght that
is in all the world For in alle the world is noo knyght that I wold
forsake pa¦rys fore  ne oone that hath doon so moche for me  And thus
to speke of the feates of Parys she doude not stynte 

Thenne came two  damoysel∣les knockyng at the chambre dore sayeng 
Vyenne ye must come to my lady  And ysabeau sprange oute sayeng that

Thenne they took the colyer and the whyte baner of vyenne and other
Iewellys and hydde them vnder theyr clothes  and wente in to the
chambre of mes∣syre Iaques  but vyenne desy∣red gretely to speke with pari•• and thought longe or he came home  And in the mene whyle messire
Iaques recouerd of his maladye and bycam alle hool wherof Vyenne had
grete Ioye but she durst not shewe it 


        How Parys and Edward retorned oute of braband 

AFter certeyn tyme that Parys had be in Bra∣band wyth hys felowe
Edward  he desyred strongely to see the fayr vyenne  For the loue of
hyr destrayned hym mo∣che strongly  Neuertheles he durst not telle it
to hys felowe  to thende that he shold take noo dysplaysyr of hys
departyng  And sone after the space of v dayes Parys receyued a letter
that hys fader was seek  & thēne he sayd to Edward  Ryght dere brother
& felowe  pleseth it you to wete that my fader is sore seke  & me
semeth it were good that we departed yf ye consente but I praye you that
ye take noo desplayryr in thys depar∣tyng  for yf it playse god we shal
sone retorne  And edward seyng the Iuste reason of Pa∣rys and hys good
wylle  sayd to hym that he was wel content & plesyd  wherfore
Incontynente they departed oute of braband


      

and came in to the cyte of vy∣enne  of whos comyng messyr Iaques had
souerayn playsyr specyally  by cause he had herde that Parys hys sone
had doon valyauntly feates of armes  Now it happed that whan Parys was
arryued at home wyth hys fader lyke as he was accustomed  Allewaye
tofore or he wente to hys ••edde  he wente to make hys orysons and pray¦ers  and after he aduysed
yf he lacked ony thynge  and fonde that tho thynges that he loued beste
were taken awaye  wherof he was moche angry  and quasi half in despayr
in suche wyse that alle the nyght he coude not slepe And whan it came i•• the mor∣nyng he came to hys moder and sayd  Moder how is it that ye
haue not kepte my chābre cloos and shytte  For I lacke cer∣tayn thynges
whyche I wold not gladly lese  and haue for them grete dysplaysir  To
whom hys moder ansuerd  My sone by my fayth there neuer entred therin
persone  but on a tyme whan your fader was seek came my lady dyane and
hyr dough∣ter vyenne  and whan they had vysyted your fader  they wente
al aboute for to see thys castel  and thenne they entred in to your
chamber  But I can not thynke that they took ony thyng for they taryed
not longe  sauf onely vyenne whyche taryed o∣nely allone sauf hyr
damoysel  by cause she was euyl at ease at hyr hert  wherfore my sone
I praye you to take noo dysplay∣syr  And thenne Parys sayd to hym
self  yf none other theef haue taken it sauf she I shal not be
dyscouerd  Neuertheles I wote neuer yf Vyenne hath taken it awaye for
ony thynge  And after he arayed hym self and cladde hym moche no∣bly 
& wente to do the reuerence to the daulphyn  and to dame Dyane  And
after to Vyenne theyr doughter  And the dol∣phyn receyued hym moche
cur∣toysly  And the daulphyn demaunded hym tydynges and of many other
thynges  And whan the fayre lady Vyenne sawe parys of the grete desyre
that she had to see hym  and of the grete loue that she bare to hym 
alle hyr ch••re was coloured lyke a fresshe rose in the monthe of Maye  and coude
not be contente ne fylled to be∣holde hyr fayre loue and frende Parys 
And the more she by∣helde hym  the more grewe and encreaced hyr loue
toward hym And Parys beyng tofore the dolphyn on his knee moche hum¦bly
durst not boke on Vyenne  But in hys herte he had grete payne  And who
had wel by holden hym  had wel seen in his


      

vysage hys thought  And after that the dolphyn had demaun∣ded hym of
that it plased hym Parys took leue of the dolphyn and of my lady dyane &
of vy∣enne theyr doughter & retorned home to hys faders hous 

AFter a fewe dayes Vy∣enne in suche wyse as loue destrayned hyr said to

parlament that he had had wyth vyenne  & Edward sayd to hym  fayre
brother and frende  herein is no Iape ne truffes  but I praye you that
ye do your thynges secretly for there ben many false tonges And Vyenne
was moche more Ioyous than she had ben accusto¦med  and Parys also 
And the sayd Parys & edward hys felowe made grete chyualryes & dyd grete
armes  whyche were moche playsaunt to the fayre vy¦enne  Thenne it
happed that af∣ter certeyn tyme seyng the dol∣phyn that hys doughter was
come to xv yere of age  treated for to gyue to hyr an husbond  And
many tymes he had ben re¦quyred of many noble prynces but by cause he

consente And in treatyng thus of mary¦age Parys herde somme thynges
wherof he was sore ennoyed in hym self  and thought  why thynke not I
to haue this noble lady whyche is so moche desy∣red of so many noble
prynces & barons  and sore bewaylled hym self  and dyd soo moche that
he spake to vyenne and sayd  O swete Vyenne  where is your fayr and
agreable promesse that ye made to me whan I departed fro you  and how
may it be  that your fader speketh for to marye you 

WHan vyenne herde Pa∣rys speke in thys ma∣nere  she sayd to hym pa¦rys
yf my fader speke to me of maryage  it is noo grete mer∣uaylle  for I
may not deffende hym  Neuertheles I haue not consented to ony maryage 
And ye knowe wel that maryage is


      

nothyng worth  wythout the con¦sentyng of bothe partyes  wher∣fore I
praye you to be contente  for I promyse to you that I shal neuer haue
man in mariage but you  and I wold that it shold be shortly
accomplysshed yf it pleased god  honestly & Iustly and not in synne ne
in ordure  Therfore I wyl that ye assaye one thynge  which shal be
moche dyffycyle to doo and ryght pe∣ryllous  but neuertheles it byho¦••eth that it be doon  thēne sayd Parys  honourable lady  that whyche
shal playse you to com∣maunde me  I shal accomplisshe it with good hert
though I shold deye  & thanne sayd Vyenne  I wyl that Incontynent ye
say to your fader  that he goo to my lord my fader  and requyre hym
that he gyue me in maryage to you  and that herein ther be no
deffaute  & whan Parys herde the wylle & desyre of vyenne  he was
quasi al abasshed & sayd  Ryght honourable lady & how  wyl ye that I
deye thus  I praye you yf it playse you  that it be not doo  Thenne
vyēne sayd sette ye so lytel by me  that ye wyl not enterpryse this 
Alas where is your entendement  Certes it must nedes be doon 
Incontynent Parys ansuerd  worshypfull lady  sythe it playseth you  I
shal accomplysshe your cōman∣dement though I shold deye ther∣fore an
hondred thousand tymes & thus took leue of vyenne and wente to hys fader
Incontynent and sayd to hym  Dere fader alwaye ye haue shewed to me
grete loue  wherfore I byseche al myʒty god that he rewarde you lyke as
I desyre  Dere & honou¦rable fader I wold praye you of one thynge  and
by cause it is doubtous I wyl that ye promyse it to me tofore I say it
to you  for ellys I wyl not say it vnto you  & hys fader sayd to hym 
My sone there is nothyng in the world that I may doo for the  but I
shal accomplysshe it by the grace of god  therfor say to me thy playsyr
& wylle  & thenne parys tolde to hys fader a parte of the pryuete and
promesse that he had wyth vyenne  by cause he shold wyth the letter
wylle doo that  whyche he wold requyre hym  Thenne sayd parys to his
fader  the prayer that I praye & requyre you is  that it playse you to
say to the dolphyn  that he gyue to me hys doughter to wyf and in
maryage  And I humbly byseche you that herein ye wyl not faylle me  &
messire Iaques heryng hys sone thus speke  almoost he was fro hym self
for the grete folye y^t he sayd to hym  & he sayd in repreuyng hym that
he neuer shold speke more of that fayte  for he wold not deye for hys
doughter  and


      

that he shold demaunde of hym somme other thynge  for it were grete
folye to speke to hym of suche a thynge  And parys sayd worshypful
fader  as moche pe∣ryllous is it to me as to you  therfor I am not
abasshed thugh ye reffused to doo it  But loue enforceth and
constreyneth me so strongely  that I am half con¦fused  and am as wel
contente that he do it not  as to doo it  but that ye do your deuoyr
one∣ly  and so longe parys prayed hys fader  that be promysed hym to
doo it 


        How messire Iaques demaū¦ded of the doulphyn hys dough¦ter
        vyenne in maryage for hys sone Parys 

THenne went messire Ia¦ques to the dolphyn all chaunged of colour and
sayd to hym  My ryght redoub∣ted and souerayn lord a certeyn requeste
is made to me  whyche I must say vnto you  the whiche me semeth is of
passyng lytel reason  and therfore it must be at your mercy  and in
caas ye fynde therin dysplaysyr  that ye pardonne me  and to take noo
regarde to my grete folye  The doulphyn trustyng in the grete wysedom
of messire Iaques graū¦ted hym to say what someuer he wold  Thenne sayd
messire Ia∣ques  Myn hye and souerayn lord  Parys my sone hath pray¦ed
me so moche that I shold re∣quyre of you vyenne your dou∣ghter to be hys
wyf  the whiche thynge is not onely to say  but also to thynke grete
presumpsy∣on and grete folye  but the loue of my sone constrayneth me
soo strongely  that by force I must say it to you  And sodeynly the
doulphyn was moeued in grete felonnye  and wold not suffre hym to ende
hys wordes  but re¦preued hym moche hardly say∣eng  vylayne & vassal
that thou arte  how kepest thou my wor∣shyp  by god I shal wel
chastyse you  that ye shal neuer thynke suche thynges  and comaunded
hym that Incontynent he shold departe thens  and that neuer be¦ne hys
sone shold come in hys syght  wherfore messire Iaques departed thens
moche rebuked holdyng doun hys heed  and re¦torned in to hys hous  &
tolde to hys sone Parys al that had be sayd and doon bytwene hym & the
Doulphyn  wherof Parys thanked moche hys fader 

THe doulphyn wente in grete thouʒt thurgh the paleys hauyng grete
In¦dygnacyon and alle angry in soo moche that none durst speke to hym ne
come in his waye  and he beyng thus in thys manere


      

he sente for his doughter vyēne & made hyr to come to hym  and sayd to
hyr  we haue had wor∣des of grete dysplaysyr  Thys vyllayne messyre
Iaques hath sayd to vs that we shold gyue you to wyf and in maryage to
hys sone Parys  Aduyse you what wysedom it were  by god or that I
shold do it  I wold ra∣ther make you a nonne or a menchon  & it shal
not be longe to  but that ye shal be hyely ma∣ryed  so that ye shal
holde you conde••••e  & here I swere to you that yf it were not for the grete seruyces
that he hath doon to me Incontynent I shold do smyte of hys hede  &
whan vyenne sawe hyr fader in so grete angre ayenst messyre Iaques & hys
sone  she sente for to seche Edward for to come speke to hyr  & whan
Ed∣ward was come Vyenne sayd to hym  Edward it is soo that my fader is
moche angry ayenst messire Iaques & ayenst parys wherof I haue grete
dysplaysyr & haue grete doubte that my fa∣der wyl do somme harme to
Pa¦rys  & therfore I wyl that ye say to hym  that he kepe hym self in
the moost secretest wyse that he may  and I shal also see the manere yf
I may appease his felonnye and angre  Thenne ed∣ward Incontynent took
leue of vyenne  & went & sayd to paris all that vyenne had sayd to hym
& sayd fayr brother  me semeth that it were good that ye depar¦ted oute
of this contrey for to absente you for a space of tyme For it may be
that to the doul∣phyn shal longe endure hys an¦gre  as I vnderstonde by

ye haue counceylled me soo I shal so do  not wythstondyng that it shal
be to me a sorouful & an heuy departyng  but er I departe I shal take
leue of Vy∣enne though I shold deye 

THenne Parys dyd soo moche that he spake vnto vyenne on a derke nyght at
a lowe wyndowe  where as they myght wel say what they wold  I am
certeyn sayd vy∣enne that my fader hath wylle to hurte you  wherof I
lyue in grete melancolye  For in al the world is no thynge that I loue
so moche as you  & yf by aduen¦ture ye deye I wyl not lyue  Thenne
sayd parys  h••nourable lady it semeth me beste that I departe fro hens a certeyn tyme

commaunde me  what someuer come therof  And vyēne seyng the good wylle
of parys after many wordes she sayd to hym  Parys my frende I knowe
well the grete loue that ye bere to me  & sythe it so is  I swere to

may escape oute of the royame of fraunce  and that we may goo in to
somme other lordshyppe  where as we may lyue Ioyously and surely
Neuertheles tofore or we departe from hens I wyl that ••e promyse two thynges  The fyrst is  that ye touche not my body vnto
the tyme that we be lawfully mary¦ed  The second is that ysabeau parte
in al the goodes that we shal haue  and other thynge wyl I not as for
thys present tyme  but that onely our depar∣tyng may be shortely  and
I shal pourueye somme Iewels & money for our necessyte  and al thys
Parys promysed to hyr  and eche departed fro other for tadresse suche
thynges as to them shold be necessarye 

WHan Parys was depar¦ted fro vyenne he wente to a man named george and
sayd to hym  George my frende alwaye I haue trusted in you  and haue
alwaye loued you  wherfore I praye you now that to thys that I shal say
you ye faylle me not  for I promyse you ye shal not lese therby  and
George promysed to hym to doo al that shal be to hym possyble wyth ryght••good hert  & thenne Parys sayd to hym  knowe ye for cartayn that I
haue wrath & rancour to a man of thys to••••ne for certayn desplaysyr that he hath doon to me  wherfor I wyl slee
hym  and Incontynent as I haue slayne hym  I wyl departe out of the
royame of Fraunce  wherfore I praye you y^t ye wyl goo to Aygues
mortes  & that ye there make redy a galeye fur¦nysshed of al thynges
necessarye tyl that we be arryued there as we wold be  And also I praye
you that ye doo ordeyne fro hens to aygues mortes fro v myle to v myle

be nede  & also I wyl that ye do thys as secretly as ye may  and loo
here is mo¦ney ynough for to furnysshe these sayd thynges  George
sayd  I shal doo al thys gladly  And Incontynent made hym redy  &
whan he came to aygues mortes he hyred a galeye  and establis∣shed al
the passages  and dyd wel al that parys had charged


      

hym  & came ageyn  and tolde to parys how he had pourueyed al that he
had charged hym  whe¦rof parys was moche Ioyous  & anone parys wente
and tolde to Vyenne that alle thynges that she had comaunded were doon
And thēne they concluded that the nexte nyght folowyng that at a certeyn
houre eche of them shold be redy  thēne he took leue of hyr and wente
home  and bad George to take two hors out of hys stable  and that he
shold sa¦dle them and abyde hym wyth∣oute the cyte in a certayn place
tyl he shold come  & Edward the felowe of Parys wyste noo thynge of
alle thys  wherof he was moche abusshed and mer∣uayllously angry whan

        How parys ladde awaye vy∣enne and ysabeau by nyght 

WHan Parys was pour∣ueyed of money and of al other thynges beyng to them

rode alwaye tofore by cause to knowe wel the waye  and whyles they thus
rode  aroos a storme wyth a grete rayne whyche endured tyl on the morne
at nyght  and thenne they arryued nygh vnto a lytel towne  but they entr••d not by cause they wold not be knowen  and wente & lodged them in a
lytel chyrche nygh vn∣to the toun  where they fonde a chapelayn whiche
receyued them gladly the best wyse he myght  & thenne whan the nyght
came Parys and the chapelayn slepte in a lytel hous Ioynyng to the
chyrche  George and parys ser∣uaunte slepten in the stable with the
bestes  And vyenne & ysa∣beau slepten in the chyrche  and in the
mornyng erly they wente lyghtly to horsback  & rode tyl they came nyghe
vnto a ryuer  whyche was rysen hye by cause of the rayne that had
fallen  Thenne parys was moche angry by cause he sawe wel that it was
moche peryllous  & sayd to Ge∣orge  that he shold serche & ad∣uyse
somme good place where they myght passe ouer  & george wythdrewe hym a
lytel from them  and chaas a place whiche


      

thought hym good  and took the ryuer wyth hys hors  And whan he was in
the myddes of the streme hys hors faylled hym that he was drowned and
hys hors also  Parys seyng that george was drowned was mo∣che sore
abasshed  and durst make noo semblaunte  by cause that fayre vyenne
shold haue noo me lancolye  And after Vyenne demaunded of Parys where
ge∣orge was bycomen  and parys answerd to hyr  that he had sent hym
for to serche somme good passage  and they wold torne in to the chyrche
ageyn tyl Ge∣orge were comen  And vyenne ansuerd to hym that it playsed
to hyr wel soo to doo  For she had grete doubte and fere for to passe
the water  And whan they were in the chyrche  Parys was moche aferde
to abyde longe in that place  for he sawe that it was  not sure 
wherfore he de∣maunded the chapelayn  yf they myght in ony wyse passe
that water  And the chapelayn sayd not in thre dayes tyl the water were
decre••ed and aualed  And parys sayd to hym that he shold goo in to the towne
to seche and see yf he myght fynde ony men that wold make a brydge soo
that they myʒt passe And that he shold spare for no money  For I shal
paye to them as moche as they wyl haue  & the chapelayn sayd that he
shold doo hys beste  Thus dyd Pa∣rys noo thynge but thynke how they
myght passe the ryuer  Now leue we Parys and torne we to the doulphyn 
whych had lost his fayre doughter vyenne 


        How the doulpyn dyd doo serche and seche vyenne by hys
        seruauntes 

ON the morne that vyēne was loste & departed fro the hous of hyr fader 
& that the doulphyn knewe it  he supposed to haue goon oute of hys
wytte  & al the courte was troubled  & sente hastely men on horsback &
a fote by dyuers par¦tyes the moost secretely that he myght  & prayed
them that they shold brynge home to hym vy∣enne quyck or dede  It
happed by aduēture that one of his men a fote that was sente to seche
Vyenne came in to the towne where as the chapelayn was co∣men to seche
men to make the brydge  The foteman demaun∣ded euery man yf they had
seen two damoyselles whyche were fledde fro the doulphyns courte  Thēne
the chapelayn said to hym that it was not longe syth suche tweyne
departed wyth other men And the man supposed that the sayd chapelayn
had sayd it


      

in Iape or in mockyng  And sayd that the Doulphyn was moche angry  and
had sworne that yf ony mā or woman kne∣we where they were and shewed it
not  that he shold make them to lose theyr hedes  And whan the
chapelayn herde these wordes he remembred hym of them that were hyd in
hys hous  And in grete drede sayd to hym  that he shold tarye there a
lytel  & that for the loue of my lord doul∣phyn he wold gladly seche
for them  and assone as he myght fynde tydynges of them he shold lete
hym wyte  And so departed fro thens  and retorned home ageyn  and
tolde al thys to pa¦rys  and what he had herde in the toune  sayeng
also that he doubted that it was for them of hys companye  wherfore he
sayd to hym ferthermore  syr I praye you that ye departe from hens 
and suffre not that I lese my lyf  but take ye the beste coun∣ceyl ye
can  For there ben fyfty men on horsback that seche you  whan Parys
herde hym say this it nedeth not to demaunde yf he were heuy and
melancolyous  and for the grete sorowe that he had he chaunged al his
colour  And he sayd to the chapelayn  I praye you that ye tarye a
ly∣tel & I shal make you an an∣suer  & thenne Parys went to vyenne 
for to telle to hir al thys feat  And whan vyenne sawe hym entre  and
so chaunged in hys colour sayd to paris  what tydynges brynge ye whyche
are so pale and your colour chaun∣ged  I praye you as hertely as I can
that it playse you to telle me  Thenne Parys sayd to hyr The tydynges
that I brynge ben euyl for you and for me  For shortly shal be
accomplisshed our aduenture  and therfore •• I wyl slee my self  and also he said com¦playnyng  O god how my lyf
is sorowful and heuy to haue brought thys excellent lady as ye ar in
suche daunger  O good god why gaf thou not to me the deth tofore or
that I fette hir out of hyr faders hous  O alas my fader and my moder
what shal be falle of you  whan the doul∣phyn shal knowe  that I haue
stolen from hym hys doughter  O my good felowe Edward why counceylled
not I wyth the tofore or I had doon thys folye And after he retorned to
vyēne sayeng  and what shal falle of you my lady  whan your fader shal
see you  Certes I thynke that how cruel that he be  whan he shal see
your noble persone  his hert shal not suffre to do you ony harme  O
god almyghty do to me that grace y^t I onely may bere the payn of this
fayt & none other  O lady vnhappy was that day for you and for me whan


      

fyrst ye had acqueyntaunce of me  And whan Parys had fynysshed hys
complaynte  he tolde to Vyenne al that the cha∣pelayn had sayd to hym 
And forthwyth as a persone despay∣red  took hys swerde and wold haue
ryuen it thurgh hys body  And Vyenne as vertuouse and valyaunte took to
hyr hert  and took the swerde fro hym and com¦forted hym and sayd  O
free knyght  my Ioye  my lyf  and my solace  what wyl ye doo  knowe
ye not wel  that who that sleeth hym self wytyngly  sleeth the soule
and the body  and yf ye deye  I assure you I shal deye also  and so
shal ye be cause of my deth as wel as of your owne O Parys where is your
wyse∣dom and your prowesse  Now whan ye shold haue moste stren∣gthe &
moost vertuous courage ye be aferde  O my knyght thys is noo newe
thynge that the per¦sones that lyuen in thys world haue trybulacyons 
of what so∣meuer lygnage they be  Certes thys is not the courage of one
so valyaunte knyght as ye be  For now whome that ye ought to comforte 
she must now com¦forte you  And therfor my fayr brother and frende I
praye you as moche as ye may  that Incon¦tynente ye departe fro hens 
and that ye goo your waye  and yf ye do not so I shal slee my self wyth
your swerde  For your de¦partyng is as greuons to me  as myn shal be
to you  but it by houeth to eschewe of two euyls the werse  And also
ye ought to consydere one thyng  that not wythstondyng the grete faulte
and trespaas that I haue made to my fader  yet therfore he shal not put
me to deth  consydered the grete loue that he hath a••way had toward me  and yf ye were taken  I wote wel that ye and I
shold bothe deye  And yet I haue good hope  that myn en∣tencyon shal
come vnto a good ende  For be ye sure though he neuer pardonne me  I
shal ne∣uer haue other husbond but you and that I promyse you by my
fayth  But alle waye of one thyng I praye you  that for none other
lady ye forgete not me  And whan ye shal be in ano∣ther contreye wryte
vnto me of your aduenture  And to thende that ye the better remembre me
loo here is a rynge of gold wyth a dyamonde  the which I praye you that
ye wyl kepe for the loue of me


        How Parys departed from Vyenne  and lefte hyr in the chyrche 

AFter moche other lan∣gage paris kyssed vyēne wyth grete syghes and


      

thoughtes  and she comforted hym the best wyse she myght  in prayeng
our lord Ihesu Cryste that in short tyme she myght see hym  lyke as hyr
herte desyred moost of ony thynge that was in the world  And thenne
Pa¦rys departed fro Vyenne wyth grete sorowe and heuynesse  And took
his waye wyth hys seruaunte tyl he came to the ry∣uer wh••re they coude not tofore haue passed  and as despayred doubted noo
thynge but entred the••m  and the water was soo aualed that they passed wyth∣oute ony peryl 
And they rode two dayes wythoute ony mete  for they durst not passe
thurgh ony toun  And they passed tyl they came to aygues mortes  And
there he founde the galeye that george had hyred  whyche anone he
took  and so longe sayl¦led and rowed tyl that they arryued at Gene 
Parys made meruayllous countenaunces in the galeye  that alle they that
were therin  had supposed he had be a fool  for allewaye he was pe••syf  and ymagynatyf  and vnnethe wold speke ne say a word  Thenne
whan he was at gene he hyred hym a lodgyng & lyued there in grete
heuynesse & sorowe  Now leue we to speke of Parys and retorne we to
vy¦enne whyche abode in the chape∣layns hous


        How vyenne was founde in the chyrche by a foteman  and how she
        was brought ageyn to hyr fader 

WHan Parys was depar∣ted fro vyenne she abode allone wyth ysabeau
ma¦kyng the grettest sorowe of the world that it was a grete pyte to
byholde  lyke as she had as leef to deye as to lyue  And whan she was
wel wery of we∣pyng  and that it was force that she must retorne to the
mer∣cy of hyr fader the doulphyn  she appeased hyr self  And anone the
chapelayn went for to seche the foteman and brought hym in to the ••hyrche  And whan Vyenne sawe hym  she knewe hym wel  For she had
oftymes seen hym in hyr faders hows  And thys man sayd to hyr alle hys
charge  & that many knygh¦tes were oute for to seche hyr  And Vyenne
sayd to hym goo & telle them that thou hast foun¦den me here  & brynge
them hy∣ther  Thenne the man wente & fonde the knyghtes that thenne
were comen in to the towne  and tolde to them how he had foūden hyr  &
that they shold come with hym & he wold brynge them to the place where
she was  whan y^e knyʒtes herde these tydynges a∣non eche made grete
haste tyl they cam to hyr  thēne whā they were


      

tofore vyenne they salewed hyr and sayd to hyr that the doul∣phyn had
doo seche hyr in dy∣uers contreyes  and after they comforted hyr  and
sayd that she shold not be aferde of hyr fader  for he wold doo to hyr
noo desplaysyr  for be shal haue so grete Ioye  whan he shall see
you  that he shal pardonne you and appease hys yre 

And than Incontynent they wente to horsbacke  and brought forth the
chapelayn wyth hyr to thende that he shold excuse hyr tofore hyr fader 
and tolde how she was pure and clene of hyr body 

NOw sayth ••hystory that whan Vyenne was co∣men tofore hyr fader the doulphyn  he
made toward hyr heuy and euyll ••here  But not wythstondyng Vyenne kneled doun on bothe hyr knees to the
erthe sayeng and in wepyng  Redoubted fader I see wel and knowe in my
self that I haue mesprysed and faylled toward you  wherof I haue grete
des∣playsyr  Neuertheles folysshe loue hath enforced me to loue hym 
whyche is wel worthy to be byloued of the moost grettest lady of the
Royame of fraunce allewaye seen the noblenes that is in hym  For I wene
that in alle the world is none to hym lyke ne pareylle  And also I
thynke that I am not the first that haue trespaced by sembla∣ble
reasons  wherfore redoubted fader I am in your mercy  and take of me
vengeaunce  suche as shal playse you  and to me chas¦tysement  and
example to other Neuerth••les I wyl wel that ye knowe and that I ••swere by my soule  that I am as pure and clene of my body as I was▪
that day that I departed fro hens  And loo here is the chapelayn whyche
can say to you the trou∣the  And thenne the chapelayn tolde how she
came wyth in men of whom that one was a moche fayre knyght yonge &
curtoys the whyche I byleue is drowned in passyng a ryuer  And they
were in myn hous  and the two damoyselles slept to gyder in the
chyrche  and the knyght slepte wyth me  And the other two slepte in
the stable with the hor∣ses  Thenne whan the doulphyn herde these
tydynges he had ryʒt grete playsyr  of which he made noo semblaunte 
and gaf to the chapelayn moche money & g••••te yeftes  and bad hym retorne  After the doulphyn took vy∣enne by
the hande  in repreuyng hyr moche gretely  and lad hyr in to hyr
moders chambre wyth ysabeau  for hir moder was seke of the grete sorowe
that she had for hyr doughter  and there the


      

moder blamed them bothe two  And ysabeau sayd that vyenne was as pure
and clene of hyr body as she was the day that she departed  Alas sayd
the doul∣phyn  thou hast put vs in the moost grettest shame of y^e
world And I promyse that alle they that haue consented therto shal be
wel punysshed  ••nd in espe∣cyal that euyl traytre Parys whych is cause of al thys fayte
and yf euer I may haue hym I shal make dogges deuoure hym and also bothe
ye tweyne shal suffre therfore grete penytence  Thenne sayd vyenne
wepyng  I see wel and knowe that ye haue enten••ion to do to me moche gryef and harm  and I see wel that my lyf shal
not longe en∣dure  Therfore I swere to you in good fayth  that there
is noo man in the world that I so mo∣che loue as I doo hym whom ye so
menace and thretene  For in hym I haue my thought & cou∣rage wythoute
euer to faylle hym  and yf ye shortly gyue to me my penaunce  so moche
short¦ly shal be my deth  And yf ye suffre me to endure it longe  so
moche more shal I bere it  and my soule shal be the more sure to fore
almyghty god  & knowe ye for certayn that for hym and hys loue I am
redy to deye  Thēne the doulphyn yssued out of the chambre in grete
Indyg∣nacyon  and commaunded that the fader of Parys shold be put in an
euyl pryson  And that al hys goodes shold be taken fro hym  And also
that vyenne & ysabeau shold be enclosed in a chambre  and that wel
lytell mete shold be gyuen to them  and moche he menaced and thre∣tened
them  and thus they a∣bode a longe tyme in that cham∣bre  and
contynuelly Vyenne dremed of Parys 

And whan she myght haue ony space to speke to Edward felowe of Parys 
she requyred hym that he shold serche yf he myght haue ony tydynges of
pa¦rys  and that he shold lete hyr knowe therof  In thys ma¦ner
vyenne passed hyr tyme in grete sorowe & in grete thought alle waye
desyryng for to here somme tydynges of that noble knyght Parys 

WHan Vyenne had ben a grete tyme in thys ma∣nere  The doulphyn
by∣thought hym that thenne hys doughter Vyenne had been wel chastysed 

And thennne the Doulphyn fader of Vyenne ordeyned that she came oute of
pryson  And thēne he purposed to gyue to hyr an husbond  and sette hyr
in hyr fyrst estate  wherof alle the


      

courte was moche Ioyous  and in especyal Edward felowe of Parys  And
after certayn tyme the doulphyn wrote to the Erle of Flaunders that he
wold doo marye hys doughter vyēne wherupon he requyred hym that he wold
gyue to hym counceyll in thys mater  For it was vnto hym chargeable 
And duryng the tyme that vyenne was oute of pryson hyr herte was neuer
in reste  but euer she was heuy and sorouful for hyr swete and faythful
frende parys  whome she myght not see  and knewe not whether he were
dede or a lyue  And whan the doulphyn sawe hyr so heuy  On a day he
sayd to hyr  My swete dough∣ter  wherfore be ye so sorouful  gyue
your self to playfyr  For as to me I remembre nomore the thynges
passed  And there is noo thynge in the world that ye demaunde me but I
shal doo it for you  And thenne vyēne whyche had not forgeten Pa∣rys
sayd to hym  Honourable fader yf I were sure of the thyn¦ges passed
that they were for∣goten by you  I shold be more sure than I am  but I
byleue fermely  that ye haue them yet in your remembraunce  For ye
holde alwaye messyre Iaques in pryson the fader of Parys  whyche is not
culpable of ony parte of thys dede ne cause  And yf ye wold do to me
soo moche grace that ye wold par∣donne hym and rendre to hym al hys
goodes & thynges I shold be moche Ioyous  And the doul¦phyn for the
playsyr of hys doughter sayd to hyr  that it wel playsed to hym  and
Incon∣tynt the doulphyn dyd do dely∣uer messyre Iaques out of pry∣son 
and dyd do retorne to hym al hys goodes and thynges that had be taken
from hym  wherof messyre Iaques had grete play∣syr  for yf he had
abyden leng••r in pryson he had be dede for hun∣gre  for there was none that
com¦forted hym but edward  whiche comforted hym the best wyse he
myght  & gaf to hym dayly that whyche was necessarye for hys lyf  whan
vyenne knewe that messyre Iaques was oute of pryson  she was moche
Ioyeful and had grete playsyr  Ne∣uertheles al the consolacyon of
vyenne was whan she myght speke wyth edward of hyr loue Parys  And thus
she passed hyr tyme in ryght grete payne and heuynesse the beste wyse
she myght 

WHan the Erle of flaun¦ders had redde the let∣ters of the doulphyn &
vnderstood that he wold marye his doughter vyēne whych was


      

of the age ef xv yere  he trayted that she shold haue of two ba∣rons
that one  that is to wete the sone of the kyng of englond  or the sone
of the duke of bour∣goyne  whyche thenne had grete renomme•• in fraunce  and that was for the grete prowesse that was in hym  and
the sayd erle made thys sayd traytye  & sente word vnto the doulphyn 
that hym semed best that the sone of the du•• of bourgoyn were beste for ••yr  by cause that it shold be grete playsyr to the Kynge of fraunce 
and that he was a no∣ble knyght and of grete pro∣wesse  and whan the
doulphyn had receyued these letters fro therle of Flaunders  he sente
to the kyng of fraunce to wyte of hym whyche shold best playse hym of
these two prynces afore∣sayd that shold haue his dough¦ter For whome
that he wold shold haue hyr  wherof y^e kyng had grete playsyr  and
reputed it to hym grete honour  And he sente to hym worde  that it
shold playse hym best that he maryed wyth the sone of the duc of
bour¦goyn hys neuew  and in so do∣yng he shold doo to hym ryght grete
playsyr  and wold do as moche for hym whan tyme and place requyreth 
And seyng the doulphyn the wylle of the kyng of fraunce sente worde to
therle of flaunders  that he had coun∣seylled wyth hys barons  & also
that it was the wylle of the kyng of fraunce that his dough¦ter shold be
maryed to the sone of the duc of bourgoyne  And thenne therle laboured
so moche in thys mater that he made the sayd sone of the duc to agree as
for hys partye 


        How Parys sente a letter to hys felowe Edward 

NOw late vs leue to spe∣ke of thys mater  and retorne we vnto Parys
whyche abode in the cyte of gene moche heuy  and whyles thys maryage

And Parys beyng in thys manere had grete desyre to haue tydyn∣ges of

grete you wel  the whiche haue suffred for you moche dysease  payne
and desplaysyr  and in especyal your fader whiche hath longe been in
pryson  & alle hys goodes were taken fro hym  and also I certefye you
that by the grace of god and at the request and prayer of Vyenne  the
doul∣phyn hath pardonned hym alle hys euyl wylle  and delyuerd hym oute
of pryson & restored to hym alle hys goodes ageyn  And plese it you to
wete fayre


      

brother that vyenne hath had so moche Ioye and so grete playsyr whan she
had knowleche that ye were a lyue  that it is wonder to byleue  For al
hyr consolacy¦on was for to haue tydynges of you  & she recommaundeth
hyr to you as moche as she may  & hath moche grete desyre to see you &
also prayeth you not to wyth∣drawe you fro hyr ne fro that contreye  ••ut that ye wryte ofte to hyr of your estate  And she sendeth to you an
eschaunge of thre thousand floryns  of whiche she wyl that ye take your

reteyneth  and after that she had redde it  I myght neuer haue it
ageyn  but she sayd  that she had leuer to lese al that she had  than
the said letter & ye shal knowe that the doul∣phyn treateth a maryage
for hyr the which is the sone of the duc of bourgoyn  & he hopeth fro
day to day  that it shal be accomplys¦shed  Neuertheles I truste soo
moche in vyenne  seyng y^t whiche she hath sayd to me  that she wyl
neuer haue other husbond but you  wherfore lyue ye forth Ioy¦ously in
hope  Dere brother I thanke you as I can or may for the presentacyon
that ye haue doon for me  your soule be wyth god  to whome I praye
that he kepe you in hys holy warde & protectyon &c̄  whan thys letter
was wryten he delyuerd it to the courrour  whyche made hasty Iourneyes
so that he arryued at genes  where as the good knyʒt Parys dwelled and
abode 

WHan the noble paris had redde the letter  & knewe that vyenne had been
in pryson  almoost for sorowe he was oute of his wytte cursyng his euyl
fortune  & after he cur¦sed the day that he was borne & moche
dyscomforted hym self  & also he cursed the doulphyn say∣eng  O cruel
fader and vncon∣nyng  how may your hert suffre to put in pryson hyr
that is soo noble a creature  whyche is ful of al vertues  that is the
fayre vyenne  whyche is noo thynge cause of thys fayte  For I my self
onely haue doon it  & ought to bere allone the penaunce  alas &
wherfore dyd not god to me so moche grace  that I had be ta¦ken in
stede of hyr  O fayre vy∣enne what haue I doo for you  whyche haue
suffred soo moche payne for me  Thus he made a grete whyle hys sorowe
in we∣pyng strongely  After Parys sawe that the fayr vyenne was


      

retorned in to hyr fyrst estate  wherof he was moche Ioyous  & whan he
had receyued the es∣chaunge that vyenne had sente hym he hyred a moche
fayr hous & cladde hym honestly & rychely & took acqueyntaunce & amytye
wyth the grettest & beste of the cyte  in so moche they dyd hym moche
good and honour  & thus duellyd parys a grete whyle  alway remembryng
in hys hert the loue of vyenne  for alleway hys loue encreaced  And
euery moneth they wrote letters eche to other  of whyche here is made
noo mencyon  for it shold be o∣uer longe to reherce  & torne we here
in to flaunders for the fayte of the maryage of the excellent vyenne 

NOw sayth thystorye that whan therle of Flaun∣ders had accorded the
ma¦ryage with the duc of bourgoyn he made redy hys sone and appa¦raylled
hym of companye and of horses  and lete it be knowen to the doulphyn 
that he shold make redy al thynge necessarye  & that he shold hastely
sende to hym his sone  whan the doulphyn herde these tydynges  that
he  whome he so moche desyred shold come he was moche Ioyous  and
In∣contynent dyd doo make redy many grete & meruayllous fes∣tes  &
duryng the same dyd doo make redy hys sone the duc of bourgoyne  horses
and peple for to accompanye hym whiche was a fayre thynge to see  And
after sent hym to therle of flaū∣ders  whyche receyued hym wyth grete
Ioye & wyth grete honour & fested hym two dayes  and delyuerd to hym
hys sone in his companye  and sente hym to the doulphyn  & whan the
doulphyn knewe theyr comyng  he dyd do make redy to receyue hym  and
whan they were by a day Iour∣neye nygh vnto vyenne  he rode oute wyth
moche grete chyual∣rye  & receyued them with muche grete Ioye and
playsyr  & eche made grete feste to other whyche were ouer longe to
recounte  Neuertheles tofore that the doul¦phyn came to the sone of she
duc of bourgoyn  hee & hys wyf en∣tred in to the chambre of vyenne to
whome the doulphyn sayd  Fayr doughter it was the play syr of god that
I & your moder were to gyder vij yere wythoute hauyng ony chylde  and
in the viij yere our lord comforted vs wyth you  in whom we haue al our
affectyon  For we haue ney¦ther sone ne doughter but onely you  ne
suppose neuer to haue  so we truste that by you we haue one  It is trewe ••hot so as god wyl and hath ordeyned we wyl assemble you to a moche
honou∣ble maryage  the whiche to vs


      

playseth moche  for I ensure you the doughter of the Kynge of Fraunce
hath moche desyred to haue hym  that ye shal haue  for god hath
endowed hym with so moche good & honour as hert of knyght may haue 
thus to the playsyr of god  & of the vyr∣gyn marye  we haue made the
maryage of the sone of the duke of bourgoyne & of you  wherfor we praye
you  that therto ye wyl gyue your good wylle & play∣syr  and also that
ye wyl haue the maryage agreable  Thenne vyenne ansuerd to hyr fader 
Honourable fader & lord I wote wel that thys that ye entende is for my
wele & prouffyt  But not wythstondyng that I be in age for to marye  &
that in thys maryage I shold receyue honour more than I am worthy 
Neuer¦theles I shal not yet be maryed for yf we haue not thys man  yf
it playse god we shal haue another as good or better  And thynke ye not
myn honourable lord  that I say thys for ony ex¦cusacyon  but it is
sythen xv dayes that I haue be euyl dys∣posed of my persone  & the
ma¦ladye that I haue causeth me to take noo playsyr for to be ma∣ryed 
For I haue auowed vnto god neuer to be maryed to thys man ne to none
other  as longe as I shal be in thys maladye  Thenne thought the
dolphyn that vyenne sayd it for shame∣fastnes  Neuertheles he
trauayl¦led hyr euery day wyth fayre wordes that she shold consente to
thys maryage  but it auayl∣led nothyng all that he dyd  for the wylle
of hir was more in pa¦rys than in ony man of the world 

THenne on the morne the sone of the duc of bour∣goyne  & the sone of
the erle of Flaunders entred in to the cyte of vyenne  wherof the
doulphyn had grete Ioye & play¦syr  and thys feste endured wel fyftene
dayes  that they dyd no thynge  but daunce  synge  and dyd other
dyuers playsyrs  and duryng thys feste the doulphyn sayd to the sone of
the duke of bourgoyn to thende that he shold thynke none euyl by cause
he a∣bode so longe or he myght espouse hys doughter  Fayr sone I praye
you & byseche that ye take you to playsyr and Ioye  And gryeue you noo
thynge of thys longe abydyng here  for certayn my doughter is so seke 
that vn∣nethe she may speke  whyche doth to hyr grete desplaysyr and
shame  for fayn she wold be out of hyr chambre  And thenne the sone of
the duc of bourgoyn as he shat mente but good fayth  byleued it
lyghtly  Neuertheles the doulphyn dyd nothyng nyʒt


      

ne day  but admonested hys do∣ughter one tyme in fayr wor∣des  and
another tyme in me∣naces  but in no wyse he coude make hys doughter to
consente  And comaunded that she shold nothyng haue but brede & water
and vyenne abode one day soo in thys manere  and al thys dyd the
doulphyn  to thende that she shold consente to the maryage  and alwaye
he dyd to hyr more harme & payne  & vyenne was alwaye more harde  and
ferther fro hys desyre  wherof the doul∣phyn had moche grete
dysplay∣syr  and not wythoute cause  & seyng the Doulphyn that hys
doughter was soo Indurate  he thought that by somme good moyen he wold
sende home ageyn the sone of the duc of bourgoyn for he doubted that yf
he abode longe  that this feat myght be dyscouerd  and he gaf to hym
fayr Iewellys  and after sayd to hym  Fayre sone I wyl that ye take
noo desplaysyr in that I shal say to you  Me semeth wel that at thys
tyme this maryage may not goo forth of you and of my doughter  for
after that I see  & as me semethe the wylle of god is ferther than I
wold at thys tyme  For he wyl not that the maryage of you and of my
doughter take now effecte  wherfore I haue ryght grete des∣playsyr in
my hert onely for the loue of you  Thenne the sone of the duc of
bourgoyne seyng that at that tyme he myght doo noo thyng  toke leue of
the Doul∣phyn and retorned in to his con¦tree by cause that Vyenne was
not in helthe  and promysed that assone as he myght knowe that she
shold be hool  he wold retorne for to accomplysshe the mariage lyke as
the doulphyn had pro∣mysed to hym 


        How the doulphyn dyd doo enprysonne vyēne by cause that she
        wold not consente to the ma¦ryage to the sone of the duke of
        bourgoyne 

AFter certayn dayes that the sone of the Duke of bourgoyn was departed
fro the cyte of vyenne  the doul∣phyn for grete desplaysyr that he had
dyd do come tofore hym the mayster Iayler of hys pry∣son  and dyd doo
make wythin hys paleys a lytel pryson derke and obscure  and he dyd do
put vyenne and ysabeau in to that pryson  and commaunded that they
shold haue nothyng to ete but brede and water  and one damoysel in
whome the dolphyn trusted shold brynge it to them And in thys manere
vyenne & ysabeau passyd theyr tyme in grete sorowe  And thynke not that
for thys pryson  the hert of


      

vyenne wold in ony wyse con∣sente to the wylle of hyr fader  but alway
encreaced wyth hyr y^e wylle toward hir swete frende Parys  and wyth
swete wordes she comforted ysabeau sayeng  My dere suster abasshe you
not for thys derkenes  for I haue confydence in god  that ye shal haue
yet moche welthe  For my fayr suster  It is a moche ryght ful thyng
that for the good knyʒt parys whyche for me suffreth so moche payne 
that I suffre thys for hym  and also I say to you that al the paynes of
this world be nothyng greuous to me whan I thynke on hys swete vysage 
And in thys manere that one comforted that other  in spe∣kyng alle day
of the valyaunte knyght Parys 


        How the sone of the duc of bourgoyn departed fro hys con∣treye
        for to come see the fayre lady Vyenne 

WHan the sone of the duc of bourgoyne had aby¦den longe tyme in hys
contree  On a day he had grete thought of vyenne  & that was for the
grete beaute of hyr  and it dysplesed hym moche that at hys beyng there
he had not seen hyr  and so concluded to goo & see hyr  and it was not
longe after that he cam to the dolphyn and the doulphyn receyued hym
moche gladly and with grete ho∣nour  Thenne prayed he the dol¦phyn that
it myght plese hym to shewe to hym vyenne also seke as she was  For in
the world was nothyng that he soo moche desyred to see as hyr  And the
doulphyn seyng the wylle & de∣syre of hym wold noo lenger hyde hys
courage  but sayd to hym  My fayr sone by the fayth that I owe to
god  I haue had grete desyre that thys maryage shold be made  but my
dough∣ter for thys present tyme wyl take noo husbond ne be maryed
wherfore I haue grete desplaysyr and that for the loue of you  & to
thende that ye knowe  that it holdeth not on me  I swere to you that
sythe ye departed fro thys toun  I haue doon hyr to be kepte in a
pryson derke and obscure  and hath eten nothyng but brede and water
onely  and haue sworn that she shal not goo oute of pryson tyl she shal
con∣sente to haue you in maryage  And thus I praye you that ye take noo
desplaysyr  yf at thys tyme ye see hyr not  for ye may not faylle to
haue grete mary∣age  in caas that this faylle you and thenne he
ansuerd  honou∣rable syr I praye you moche her¦tely  syth that it is
so  that er I retorne I may speke to hyr  and I shal praye hyr as
moche as I


      

shal mowe  and shal see yf by ony manere I may conuerte hyr fro hyr
wylle  thenne sayd the doulphyn he was contente  Thenne he sente to
his doughter clothyng and vestymentes for to clothe hyr  and also mete
for to ete  For in two monethes she had eten but brede and water 
wherof she was moche feble  and that shewed wel in her vysage  & thus
he dyd by cause she shold consente to the maryage  And thenne it was
concluded  that the sone of the duc of bourgoyn shold come see hyr &
speke with hyr  and thenne whan Vyenne sawe thys and had re••••yued all & knewe that the sone of the duc of bourgoyn 〈…〉〈…〉 speke wyth hyr she 〈…〉〈…〉 hir damoysel  fayr 〈…〉〈…〉 how my fader & moder we•••• by these vestymentes & thys 〈◊〉〈◊〉 that I shold ete to deceyue me and put me fro my purpoos  but god for
bede that I shold do so  & thenne she took the henne  & sayd to hyr
that brought it  syth it playseth to the sone of the duke to come &
speke to me  say ye to hym that he may not come these iij dayes  &
whan he cometh that he brynge with hym the bysshop of Saynt laurens 
She that had brought to hyr the henne sayd alle thys vnto the doulphyn
and to dame ••y••ne hir moder  Thenne vy∣enne took the two quarters of the henne and
put them vnder hyr arme hooles  and helde them there so longe  that
they stonken moche strongely  And whan it came to the thyrd day  the
bysshop of Saynt Laurence and the sone of the Duke of Bour∣goyne camen
for to see vyenne  and or they entred they ope∣ned a treylle whyche gaf
lyght in to the pryson 

Thenne whan the sone of the duc sawe Vyenne in the pryson he sayd to
hir by grete pyte that he had  Noble vyenne how wyl ye deye thus for
hungre soo fo∣lyly by your owne defaulte  And knowe ye not wel that
your fader hath gyuen you to me to haue to my wyf  wher∣fore I lyue in
grete payne  and in moche grete sorowe for the du¦resse of your
courage  wherof ye doo ryght grete synne  And doubte ye not that god
punys∣sheth you for thynobedyence that ye doo to your fader and to your
moder  wherfore I praye you fayre Vyenne to telle to me for what cause
ye wyl not haue me in maryage to your husbond  Doubte ye that whan ye
shall be wyth me  that ye may not serue god as wel as ye now do that
suffre thys payne  I promyse you by my fayth y^t ye shal haue
playsaunces and lybertees in al the maners that ye shal conne
de¦maunde  Thenne I praye you


      

that ye wyl not here deye so dolo¦rously  and yf ye wyl not doo it for
the loue of me  yet at the leste do it for the loue of your fa¦der and
of your moder whyche lyue for you in grete sorowe and in grete
heuynesse  wherfore ye ought to haue pyte on them 

WHan Vyenne had herde these wordes she was quasi abasshed and sayd syr
sauyng your honour I am maryed  how be it ye knowe hym not whome I haue
in myn hert  And also I knowe and graunte ryght wel that ye be worthy
to haue one moche gret∣ter and more hye a lady than I am  and I la••e you wete that for hym that I desyre I shold suffre more payne than I
fele  And therfore I praye you that fro hens forth ye speke to me no
more of thys mater  And also I am so euyl dysposed in my per∣sone that
yf it endure in me  my lyf shal not be longe  and yf it were honeste I
shold shewe it you and than shold ye see how it stondeth wyth me 
Neuertheles approche ye ner to me  & ye shall the better byleue me 
And the sone of the duke of bourgoyne & the bysshop of saynt laurence
ap¦prouched vnto vyenne  fro whom yssued soo grete a stenche  that
vnnethe they myght suffre and endure it  whiche sauour came fro vnder
hyr arme holes of the two quarters of the henne  whi∣che were roten 
And whan vy∣enne sawe that they had felte y∣nough of the stenche she
sayd to them  lordes ye may now knowe ynough in what aduenture I am
dysposed  Thenne they took leue hauyng grete compassyon on hyr  And
they sayd to the dolphyn that vyenne was thēne half roten and that she
stanke  and demed in them self that she myght not lyue longe  qnd that
it shold be grete damage of hyr deth for the souerayn beaute that was in
hyr  And Incontynent the sone of the duc of bourgoyn took hys leue of
the doulphyn  and retorned in to hys contrey  and recounted to hys
fader the lyf of vyenne  wherof alle they that herde hym had grete pyte
in theyr herte 

WHan the doulphyn sawe that the maryage was broken  by the deffaulte of
his doughter Vyēne  he sware that she shold neuer departe fro thens 
but yf she wold consente to hys wylle 

And so she abode longe tyme in that pryson where she had grete thought
and sorowe for hyr swete and trewe frende parys  & hyr desyre was on
noo thyng but for to here tydynges of pa∣rys hyr loue  But in the estate


      

that she was in  no man myght brynge hyr tydynges  And Ed¦ward the
felowe of Parys se∣yng that Vyenne abode in soo grete payne  and that
none durst speke to hyr  he had in his herte grete sorowe  & was moche
moe∣ued of grete pyte  and also for the grete loue that he had to
pa∣rys  And concluded to make a chapel in the chyrche that tou∣ched the
palays of the dolphyn and in a corner he dyd do dygge so depe that it
was nyghe to the foundement of the pryson  where in vyenne was  and by
cause he wold not haue the thyng dys∣closed  he wold that they shold
dygge no ferther  and whan the chapel was achyeued and fy∣nysshed 
Edward alle allone dygged hym self so ferre  that he made an hole  by
whyche he spake to vyenne whan he wold whyche caue was made so secret∣ly
that no man myʒt apperceyue it  Soo it happed on a day Ed∣ward byhelde
vyēne thurgh this hole  & salewed hyr  & thenne whan vyenne herd hym &
kne∣we hym  she had so grete Ioye & consolacyon  that she semed that
she was rysen fro deth to lyf  & the fyrst tydynges that Vyenne
demaunded of hym were yf he knewe ony tydynges of parys & edward tolde
to hir that it was not longe syth  that he had recey∣ued a letter fro
hym  wryton at genes  Thenne said vyēne al we¦pyng to hym  alas whan
shal y^e day come that I shal see hym  & that doon I wold be cōtente
that god shold do his wylle of me  for none other thyng I desyre in
this world  Alas fayr brother what semeth you of my lyf & of this fayr
chambre in whyche I dwelle in  certeynly I byleue ve¦ryly  that yf
parys knewe it  y^t for his loue I suffre thus moche sorowe  that the
hert of hym shold swelte for sorowe  and after she tolde to Edward the
parlament that she had with the sone of the duc of bourgoyne  & also of
the henne  & prayed hym y^t he wold sende worde of al thys to parys &
that she recommaunded hyr to hym  & also that she had none other hope
in thys world but in hym  Edward brought to hyr euery day fro thēne
forthon mete & drynke  & al that was necessa¦rye to hyr  for hyr lyf 
& comfor∣ted hyr with fayr wordes the best wyse he myght  & Edward
wrote al playnly to parys  how for hungre she shold haue been dede  ne
had he ben  whyche dayly pourueyed for hyr al that was to hym
necessarye  and he wrote to hym alle the manere that Vy∣enne had holden
wyth the sone of the Duke of Bourgoyne And that thys fayre lady Vy∣enne
desyred noo thynge in this world but for to see hym onely


      

And also that she prayed hym that he shold not departe oute of the
contree that he was in 

WHan the noble Parys had receyued the letter fro Edward and knewe that
vyenne abode in pryson  it is no nede to demaunde yf he had grete
despaysyr  & almoost was in suche caas  as to l••se his wytte for sorowe  And on that other pa••••e he had grete drede that she shold be maryed in eschewyng of the grete
harme & payne that she suffred  and herein he was pensyf nyght and
day  sayeng to hym self  I see wel that I may not escape but that
vyenne must nedes be maryed  and by that moyen hyr loue and myn shal
faylle  Alas now see I wel that now me byhoueth noo hoope ne truste 
Alas caytyf and vnhap∣py what shal byfalle of me  I shal goo so ferre 
that fro hyr I may neuer here tydynges  ne al∣so she fro me  and after
this he bygan ageyn hys complaynte sayeng  O ve••ay god of heuen wherfore hast thou not doon to me soo moche grace  that
in the stede of hyr I myght suffre the payne that she suffreth for me 
O cruel fortune ful of cruel tormente  and what hath vyēne doon or
made that she must suf∣fre so gr••uous penaunce  Alas were it not more reason  Iustyce and cause that I
whyche haue doon alle thys euyl bere the pu∣nycyon  certes yes 


        How Parys sente a letter to Edward hys felowe 

AFter that he had made hys cōplaynte  he wrote a letter vnto Edward 
doyng hym to wyte how he had souerayn sorowe for vyēne whi∣che was in
pryson  and he than∣ked hym of the goodnes and dylygence that he had
doon to∣ward hyr  in prayeng hym that he neuer wold faylle hyr  but
contynuelly ayde and helpe hyr  And after he wrote to hym how for
veray dysplaysyr and melancolye he wold goo in to somme straunge
contreye  And that fro than forthon he shold sende to hym noo moo
letters  And that he neuer reiche for to here moo tydynges fro hym 
no∣more than of a deed persone  Thenne whan Edward had receyued these
letters fro Paris and knewe that he wold ••s∣traunge hym fro that contree of genes  and wold goo in to a strange
contreye he was moche wroth and sore agryeued  And thenne Incontynent
pa∣rys wente and tolde it to the fader and moder of Parys 


      

wherof they toke so grete sorowe that they supposed to haue loste theyr
wytte  And after edward wente and tolde it also to vy∣enne  wherof it
nedeth not to de∣maunde the grete sorowe that she, had  for it was so
grete and o∣uermoche  that yf edward had not comforted hyr  she had
been dede  And thenne she complay∣ned to ysabeau sayeng that sy∣then
she neuer entended to here tydynges of hyr loue Parys she was ryght wel
contente to deye and that she wold neuer more haue playsyr of no thynge
that was in thys world  and that thenne she wold that she were dede 
And ysabeau comforted hyr alwaye


        How parys wente to shyppe at venyse  for to goo to the holy sepul••re in Iherusalem 

AFter that pari•• had sent the letter to Edward In contynent he departed fro genes wyth
hys seruaunte  and wente to venyse where he took shyppyng  and saylled
so ferre that he cam to alexandrye  where he abode a space of tyme  &
after in that contrey he enformed hym & lerned the waye to the moūte of

that it was meruaylle  and prayed contynuelly our lord that by the
meryte of his passyon he wold gyue to hym saluacyon of hys soule  &
consolacyon for his body & also for fayr vyenne  & after he departed
fro thens and wente in to Egypte  and arryued in the contree of the
soudan  & hys money bygan to faylle  & hyred hym a litel hous wherin
he dwel¦lyd moche heuy and sorouful


      

for hys Infortune  And also he had grete desplaysyr whan he sawe other
tryumphe and wexe bordes  Now it happed on a day that parys wente to
playe and dysporte hym out of the toun in the feldes  and there mette
with the faulconuers of the soudan  whyche came fro hawkyng  and
emonge them was ••ne fawcon moche seke  and that fawcon the sowdan loued beste of alle
the other  Thenne demaunded Pa¦ry•• of the fawconner what se∣kenesse the fawcon had  And the fawconner
sayd to hym that he wys•• not  Thenne sayd paris truly yf he contynue in the ma∣ladye that he
hath he shall not lyue 〈◊〉〈◊〉 dayes  but yf ye doo that 〈◊〉〈◊〉 shal say to you  and yf he be not ho••e therwyth he shal ne∣uer be hole  Thenne sayd y^e fawl¦conner to hym 
I praye you that ye wyl telle me what I shal do for I ensure you
faythfully  that yf ye may make hym hole  it shal mowe auaylle you and
me also and that I promyse you  for the souldan had leuer lose the
beste cyte that he hath than this faw∣con  Thenne Parys wente and
sought certayn herbes  and gaf them to the fawlconner and bad hym to
bynde them to the feet of the fawcon  and so he dyd  and sone after
the fawlcon amended and becam as hole as euer he had be tofore  wherof
y^e souldan was moche Ioyous  and for loue of thye faulcon  the
souldan made the fawlconner a grete s••rd in hys courte  Thenne the faulcon∣ner seyng that by the moyen of
parys he had goten thys lord∣shyp  he dyd to hym moche play¦syr  &
shewed to hym as grete amytye and frendshyp as be had ben hys brother 
& brought hym in the grace of the souldan  and was receyued in to hys
courte  & the souldan loued hym soo wel  that he gaf to hym grete
offyce  and mayntened hym in grete ho¦nour  ye shal vnderstonde that
in thys tyme regned a moche holy pope  the whych was named In∣nocent 
and was a moche holy persone & ••••uoute  And it ple∣sed soo hym that he gaf oute a croysee  ayenst the
fals myscre∣auntes & hethen men  to the ende that the name of our lord
Ihesu cryst were more sayntefyed and enhaunced thurgh out al
crysty¦ente  And therfore was maad a grete counceyl emonge the
car∣dynals and prelates  & was concluded by theyr parlament that thys
croysee shold be wry∣ton to the kyng of fraunce  and to other kynges
crysten  dukes  Erles and other grete lordes  and so was it doon 


        How the doulphyn came to∣ward the kyng of Fraunce 


      

WHan the kyng of france had receyued the letters fro the pope 
Incontynēt he sente for the doulphyn of vy∣ennoys  that he shold come
and speke wyth hym  the whiche In∣contynent came at his
commaun¦dement  Thenne the kynge sayd to hym  Syr Godefroy  we haue
made you to come hyther  for ye be one of y^e moost wysest of our
courte  & also ye be of our lyg∣nage  And we late you wete that our
holy fader the pope hath wryton to vs that he hath yeuen a croysee
ayenst the mescreaūtes wherfore we for the loue and re∣uerence of god
entēde for to goo thyder  Neuertheles we haue ad¦uysed  that ye shold
goo fyrst in to thoo partyes  & we praye you for the loue and reuerence
of god that ye take on you the charge for to espye the contrees and also
the passages  Thenne the doulphyn sayd  I am redy & apparaylled to do
your comaun∣dement wyth good wylle  But how shal I mowe doo it for to
passe surely emonge the hethen peple  For yf they apperceyue in ony
wyse that I goo for to espye theyr contree  I shal not conne escape 
but that I must deye by cruel deth yf god kepe me not  Thenne sayd the
kyng ye may goo and your companye surely clothed in habyte of
pyl¦gryms  for ye knowe wel that thys is not the fyrst tyme  that many
crysten men haue been in the holy londe  wherfor I praye you yet eft
ones that in y^e name of Ihesu cryst that ye make you redy for to goo
thyder  and take wyth you of our knyghtes as meny as it shal playse
you  Thenne the doulphyn seyng the wylle of the kyng  and that
Incontynent he must departe  he sente letters to hys wyf  that he wold
goo in to the holy londe to seche the holy sayntuaryes & pylgrymages 
and prayed hyr that she moche wysely shold go∣uerne hys londe  & that
vyenne hys doughter shold not escape oute of pryson tyl he retourned for
in shorte tyme he wold come ageyn 


        How the Doulphyn took hys shyppyng for to goo in to Iherusalem 

AFter that the doulphyn had taken hys shyppe  & passed in to Surrye and
damaske  to Iherusalem and in many other places  & had ad∣uysed and
espyed moche wysely and wel alle the contree  And enquyred of the
crysten men that dwellyd there many thynges  without dyscoueryng his
wylle and entente  Neuertheles somme euyl crysten men for to gete
mo¦ney tolde it vnto the souldan of


      

babylone  Thenne whan the souldan knewe it  he maad noo semblaunte 
but Incontynent he made all the passages to be kept where as the
pylgryms went by in suche manere as the doulphyn was taken & alle hys
companye wyth hym in a place called Ra∣mon not ferre fro Iherusalem 
whyche was brought tofore the souldan  and he ordeyned that the
doulphyn shold be tormen∣ted and pyned  The doulphyn seyng hym self in
suche a poynte sayd that they shold not tor∣mente hym  and he wold say
to them the trouthe  & thus he re∣counted to the souldan how the Pope
had gyuen oute a croysee ayenst them  & how he was comen to espye the
contreye  whan the souldan sawe thys  he sayd that he wold aduyse hym
of what deth he wold do hym to deth  in maner that al other shold take
ensaumple  And commaunded that anone he shold be ledde in to
alysandrye  & there to be put in to an harde pryson  and also that
none shold gyue to hym but brede and water  Thenne the doulphyn was
brought in to Alysandrye  & was put in to an hard and stronge toure  &
there he suffred a myserable lyf  and had kepars that kept hym nyʒt and
day  Thus was the doul∣phyn in grete sorowe  thynkyng neuer to yssue
out of y^e pryson but dede  Neuertheles the Pope and the kyng of
Fraunce  dyd ofte tymes grete payne to haue hym out by fynaunces  but
they myght not haue hym  For the souldan sayd that he shold do on hym
suche punycyon  that al other shold take ensaumple••  Now late vs leue to speke of the doulphyn  and retorne we to Parys
that knewe no thynge of these tydynges

NOw recounteth thystorye that parys was in baby∣lone lyke as ye haue
to∣fore herde  whyche knewe noo thynge of thys fayte  So it hap¦ped
that by aduenture ij freres relygyous sought thyndulgen∣ces of the holy
lande & aryueden in babylone  where they wold see the seygnorye & the
puyssaunce of the sowdan  For thenne the sowdan helde hym in Babylone
wyth moche grete puyssaunce  These two freres were of these partyes 
whyche beyng in tho partyes it happed as they wente in the towne parys
fonde them  Thenne parys salewed them & demaunded of these partyes and
sayd to them in thys manere  After that I haue herde say e∣monge you
crysten men ye haue a Pope  the whyche is moche stronge & puyssaunt 
And also ye haue many kynges  & grete lordes  & so grete townes cytees


      

and castellys  that I haue mer∣ueyll how ye suffre that we that be not
of your lawe haue the seygnorye of the holy lande whi¦che ought to
apperteyne to you as ye say  And whan the freres had herde Parys thus
speke  they were sore aferde  And one of them ansuerd in the langage
of moure  For they wyst none other but parys was a moure  & so dyd al
they of the contrey  & he sayd to hym  Syr I byleue wel that ye haue
herd say  that in our partyes been assembled grete companyes of peple &
men of warre for to come in to thyse partyes  by cause that our holy
fader the Pope  hath graunted oute a croysee  and in the tyme whyles
our men of warre assem¦bled  the kynge of fraunce whi∣che is the
grettest of crystyente  sente a noble baron whyche is named the
doulphyn of vyen∣noys for to vysyte and espye these partyes  Thenne he
beyng in these partyes  the souldan sette men in suche places where as
the pylgryms were accustomed to passe  And sodeynly he dyd do tak•• hym in a cyte named Ra∣mon  and after sente hym in to Alysandrye  and
there sette hym in an euyl pryson  wherein I suppose that he be dede 
and thus for thys cause  the fayt was dys¦couerd  Thenne sayd Parys
how is that lord named  Thenne sayd the frere  he is named godefroy of
Allaunson doulphyn of vy∣ennoys  And whan parys herde thys he was moche
abasshed  but he made noo semblaunter  And thought in hys hert  that
hys ad¦uenture myght yet come to good and effecte  Thenne he demaun∣ded
them of many thynges  and sayd to them  that he wold more speke to
them another tyme  and demaunded them where they were lodged  and they
tolde hym more for drede than for loue  for they thought he wold haue
doon to them somme harme 

WHan Parys was depar¦ted fro the freres  he was moche pens yf how and
in what maner he myght goo in to Alexandrye for to see the doul∣phyn  &
how he myght gete hym onte of pryson  and so moche he thought on his
fayte  that he pur¦posed to goo to the hostry where the freres were
lodged  and soo wente thyder  & whan the freres sawe hym  they were
sore aferde Thenne parys took them by the handes  and ladde them to
solace thurgh y^e cyte spekyng of many thynges alwaye in the langage of
moure  & sayd to them  I haue grete desyre to see that crysten knyght
whiche is in alexandrye For I haue alwaye had good wylle to the crysten
men  perad∣uenture I myght yet wel helpe


      

hym  & yf ye wyl come with me I promyse you by my lawe  that I shal
make you good chere  & doubte ye nothyng  and thenne whan the freres
herde hym thus speke they wyst not what to an∣suer  they had so grete
fere  Ne¦uertheles they trustyng in the mercy of god  they promysed
hym  that they shold goo wyth hym  though they shold deye  & prayden
god in theyr courage that he wold graunte grace that he myght come oute
of pryson  Thenne Parys had grete play∣syr of the ansuer of the freres
& wende neuer to see y^e houre  that he myght be wyth the doulphyn for
to see the ende of his aduen∣ture  and so departed fro the fre∣tes 
and wente strayte to the faulconner of the souldan wyth whom he had
grete knowleche  & sayd to hym  Seynour I thanke you of the grete
honour  curto∣sye & gentylnes that ye haue do to me  & playse it you
to wyte that I wyl departe fro hens in to alysandrye  and I promyse to
you that for your loue I shall not tarye longe  but that I shal retorne
hyther ageyn  And by cause I am there vnknowen  and that I neuer was
there  I praye you ryght humbly  that I myʒt haue a maundement ••f the soul¦dan  that he commaunde to the gouernours that I may goo
tho¦rugh alle hys londe surely  For ye knowe wel that one may not kepe
hym ouer wel fro euyl pe∣ple  Therfore I praye you and requyre that ye
wyl gete me suche a maundement  and also that ye wyl commaunde me
hum¦bly to the good grace of my lord the souldan  and forthwyth the
faulconner wente to the souldan and made hys requeste for Pa∣rys  &
Incontynent the souldan graunted hym al hys desyre  say¦eng that it
moche desplaysed hym  of the departyng of parys & yf he wold abyde &
dwelle in hys courte he wold make hym a grete lord  Thenne the
faul∣conner sayd  Dere syr he hath promysed me  that in short tyme he
shal retorne  Thenne the soul∣dan dyd do make the maunde∣ment lyke as
he wold deuyse  chargyng al his lordes offycers & subgettes of townes
cytres & castellys of his londe that they shold do to hym grete honour 
& that they shold gyue & delyuer to hym al that shold be necessa∣rye to
hym wythout takyng ony money or ony other thynge of hym  And also the
souldan gaf to Parys many ryche clothes & vestymentes of cloth of gold
and of sylke  and also he gaf to hym grete tresour  prayeng hym that
he shold not longe tarye  but has¦tely retorne ageyn  & promysed hym
that he shold make hym a grete lord  and delyuerd hys


      

maundement  the whyche was sealed wyth the propre seale of the
souldan  and sygned wyth hys owne hande

WHan Parys had recey∣ued alle these thynges that the souldan had gy¦uen
to hym  he took leue of hym and of hys courte & went with the freres in
to Alexandrye  In∣contynent after he was comen he shewed the maundement
to the admyral  the whyche anon after he had seen it dyd grete honour
to Parys  and delyuerd to hym a fayr lodgyng pourueyed of al thynges
necessarye  and de∣lyuerd another to the freres  Thadmyral came euery
day to see parys in hys lodgyng for to do hym honour and companye  and
wente & rode to gyder tho∣rugh the cyte  and by cause that Parys was
rychely clad  euery man made to hym grete honour and sayd that he semed
wel to be the sone of sōme grete moure And on a day as they rode in the
cyte they passed forth by the toure where as the dolphyn was in pryson 
Thenne Parys de∣maunded of the admyral what toure it was that was so
fayre  Thenne he tolde to hym y^t it was a moche cruel pryson &
terryble In whyche the souldan helde a prysonner a grete lord & baron of
the theste  whyche was comen for tespye these contreyes  Thēne sayd
parys I praye you late vs goo see hym  & the admyral sayd he shold
gladly  Thenne they a∣lyghted fro their horses  & en∣tred in to the
pryson  and whan parys sawe the doulphyn  he had in hys hert grete
desplaysyr  by cause of the myserable & sorouful lyf that he suffred 
& Parys de∣maūded of y^e kepars what man he was  And they sayd  that
he was a grete baron of Fraunce  Thenne sayd parys  vnderston∣deth he
mourysshe  and they sayd nay  but that notwythstondyng yf he wold
speke to hym  that they shold fynde tour••hem••n ••∣nough  Thenne sayd Parys he wold retorne another day for to demaunde
of hym of the partyes of the weste  & prayed thadmyral to gyue
comandement to the ke∣pars  that as ofte as be sh••••d come  that they shold shewe hym to hym  & Incontynent he coman∣ded
lyke as parys had desyred  & thenne they departed  & a fewe dayes
after parys retorned and came to the pryson and brought one of the
freres wyth hym that coude speke mouryske  & whan they were wythin the
pryson  pa∣ris sayd to the frere that he shold salewe hym curtoysly 
Neuerthe¦les the frere knewe noo thynge that parys coude speke
frensshe  Thenne the frere sayd to the doul¦phyn  that that lord was come


      

for to vysyte hym  & that he loued wel crysten men  & that he was wel
in the grace of the souldan  and that he trusted ys moche in hym as in
ony man of hys con∣treye  & thus the frere demaun∣ded many thynges of
the doul∣phyn in the name of parys  and sayd yf he myght doo for hym he
wold gladly

WHan the doulphyn herde the relygious frere thus speke in the persone of
the moure  he was moche abas∣shed in hys courage  bysechyng our lord
that he wold put hym in suche courage & good wylle for to brynge hym out
of pryson Parys desyred to here tydyn∣ges of the fayr vyenne sayd to the
frere  that he shold aske of the doulphyn yf he had ony wyf or
chyldren  Thenne the dolphyn began to wepe  & said that he had a wyf 
& a doughter holden for the fayrest of Fraunce  whom he helde in pryson
bycause she wold take noo husbond  Thenne paris began to comforte hym
by the mouthe of the frere  sayeng that he shold take alle in
pacyence  & god shold yet ones delyuer hym oute of pryson  by whyche
wor∣des the doulphyn was so reioy∣ced & Ioyous  that hym semed that god
had appyered to hym  & the doulphyn sayd to the frere that it was grete
pyte that the moure was not crysten  & pray∣ed our lord that he wold
gyue to hym puyssaunce to kepe hym in that good wylle that he had & so
departed that one fro that other moche comforted  Thenne parys sayd to
the kepars that he had founde so grete playsyr in the prysonner  that
he wold ofte tymes come for to dyspo••te hym and they sayd whan it playsed hym he shold retorne & be
wel∣come  and thenne parys sayd to the freres that were in y^t place yf
I thought to be sure of you  I thynke wel to fynde the moyen to brynge
thys prysonner out of pryson  & the freres were moche admerueylled of
thys whiche pa¦rys had sayd to them  and they sayd to hym  by the
fayth that we owe to our god  that of vs ye nede not to doubte  & in
caas that ye be in wylle late vs assaye but it must be doon secretely 
for ye see wel how many kepars been there contynuelly  Thenne sayd
Parys I shal gyue to you good counceyl and remedye of alle thys  but I
wyl haue two thynges  The fyrst thynge is I wyl that ye goo wyth me 
That other is that he shal gyue to me my lyuyng honourably in hys
contre  for I am in grete doubte whan I haue delyuerd hym  and shal be
in hys contreye that he wyl sette nought by me  and I can noo mestyer
ne crafte  and


      

soo I myght be wel deceyued  Therfore yf he wyl assure me  & that he
wyl gyue to me a yefte suche as I shal demaunde hym whan I shal be in
hys contreye  I shal delyuer hym & shal leue my contree for loue of
hym  & ye may see in what estate I am 

On the morne Parys and the freres came in to the pryson & the frere
recoun∣ted al thys to the doulphyn  & whan the doulphyn vnderstood
thys  hym thought that god bare hym awaye  & sayd  I thanke god &
thys moure of the good wylle that he hath toward me  For I neuer dyd
hym seruyce ne playsyr wherfore he ought to do so moche for me 
Neuertheles I hope that is the playsyr of god that he shal delyuer me
oute of pryson  I am redy to swere vpon the body of Ihesu Cryst or I
euer departe from hens  that assone as I shal be in myn owne lande I
shal mayntene hym in more gretter estate  than he ne is here and I wyl
that he doo alle hys wylle of al my londe  for it shal suffyse to me
onely that I haue a ••yuyng for me and my wyf  and I shal do al that he wylle  and so say ye
to hym on my be∣halue  And thenne the frere tolde al to parys that
whych the doul¦phyn had sayd and promysed to do  and to thende that
parys shold be more sure  he sayd to the frere that he shold brynge to
fore hym the body of our lord Ihesu cryst  and that tofore hym he shold
swere to holde alle that he promysed  and the frere tolde it to Parys 
and the doulphyn sware it tofore Parys to accom∣plysshe alle that he had
promysed And whan he had sworne  to the ende that Parys shold be the
better contente  the doulphyn re∣ceyued the precyous body of our lord
Ihesu Cryst  sayeng that it shold be to the dampnacyon of hys soule 
in caas that he accom∣plysshed not al that he had pro∣mysed whan they
shold be in his londe  and whan thys was doo parys and the freres
departed fro the doulphyn  and wente to the porte  for to wyte yf
there were ony fuste that wold come hytherward  and by aduenture they
fonde a fuste  and Parys wyth the freres spake to the pa∣trone  and
promysed hym a M besaunts of gold yf they wold lete haue passage fyue
persones  The Patron seyng the grete tre∣sour  sayd to them that he
was contente  but he wold haue half at the porte  and sayd to them 
lordes I praye you make you re∣dy  For in caas that the mou∣res of thys
londe fonde vs we shold be al dede   Thenne sayd Parys make your self
al redy  for thys nyght at mydnyght I


      

shal come  And after thys Pa∣rys retorned to hys lodgyng & dyd do make
redy moche vytayll and the best wynes that he coude gete & he with the
freres maad prouysyon of alle other thynges and mantellys and towellys 

WHan al was redy parys wente to the kepars of the pryson and sayd  I
thanke you many tymes of the playsyrs that ye haue doon to me  I wyl
now departe fro hens for to retorne to my lord the soul¦dan  but for
your loue I wyl soupe wyth you thys nyght and praye yow that we may
soupe to gyder  & they ansuerd that it wel pleased them for his loue
Thenne Parys sente for the vy∣tayll & for the wyn  and after it was
come  they souped to gy∣der  And the kepars which had not been
accustomed to drynke wyn  dranke so moche that they alle were dronke 
& Incontynent l••yed them doun to slepe  & slepte so faste  that for noo thyng they
coude not awake them  & whan parys sawe that  he sayd to the freres 
that they shold vnfeter the doulphyn  & that they shold opene the yates
of the pryson  & yf ony of the kepars awake I shal slee hym  Thenne
the fre∣res began to vnfetere the doul∣phyn wyth grete drede  prayeng
god to be theyr ayde and helpe  And whan the doulphyn was loos he
cladde hym lyke a moure After Parys slewe alle the ke∣pars one after
another by cause yf they awoke they shold not come after them 

THys doon  the doulphyn wyth parys and his var¦let  and the two freres
camen to the porte  and hastely entred in to the fuste which was al
redy  and wonde vp theyr saylle  and by the helpe of god began so fast
to saylle that wyth in fewe dayes they arryueden in a place that thenne
was crysten and there the doulphyn wente a londe by cause he was moche
greued and annoyed as wel of the see  as for the harme that he had
suffred in pryson  and there borowed money  and fro thens came in to
cypres  where was a kyng whyche had dwellyd in the courte of the kyng
of fraunce The whiche as sone as he knewe that the doulphyn of vyennoys
was come  he went to mete hym and prayed hym that he wold come and
lodge in hys paleys  And the doulphyn wente thy∣der  wherof the kyng
had grete Ioye  & there he made hym grete chyere  for many tymes they
had seen eche other in y^e kynges court of Fraunce  and after the kyng
demaunded hym of his aduen∣ture  & the doulphyn recounted


      

it to hym al alonge  and bycause of the comyng of the doulphyn he made
moche grete feste  and re¦ceyued hym moche hyely  and made hym to
soiourne there as longe as it playsed hym  And whan the doulphyn had
sojour∣ned there at his playsyr  he took leue of the kyng and of al hys
courte  thankyng hym moche of the grete playsyr y^t he had doon to
hym  The kyng seyng that the doulphyn wold departe  he gaf to hym
grete yeftes  and dyd do arme two galleyes whyche ac∣companyed hym 
and brought hym vpon the see  and had soo good wynde that in fewe dayes
after they brought hym in to ay∣gues mortes 

WHan the doulphyn was arryued  the knyghtes of the doulphyne herde it
anone  and forthwyth maad them redy & went to horsback & mette wyth hym
at aygues mor¦tes  & there receyued hym in grete honour  & so came
forth the ryʒt waye to vyenne  and for Ioye of hys comyng  al they of
the cyte made a moche noble and mer∣uayllous feste  whyche endured wel
fyftene dayes  & the play∣syr & Ioye was so grete emonge them by cause
they had recou∣uerd theyr lord  that noo man shold and coude haue
thought it  Parys in alle this wyse ne∣uer chaunged hys vesture ne
clo¦thyng but contynuelly wente to masse  and by the commaunde∣ment of
the doulphyn the people dyd hym grete reuerence & ho∣nour  so moche
that parys was ashamed therof  and spake noo thynge but mouryske  And
he had a grete berde  and made to noo pers••ne of the world ony knowleche  and after a whyle of tyme  the doulphyn
for tac∣complysshe that he had promysed to parys by the frere  dyd do
say to parys and do demaunde yf he wold haue the seygnourye of hys londe
and contree  For he was al redy for taccomplysshe that  whyche he had
promysed  And Parys made to hym an∣suer  that he shold kepe stylle hys
londe  Thenne the doulphyn dyd do demaūde hym yf he wold haue hys
doughter vyenne  and parys made the frere to say ye  for that pleased
hym wel  And thenne they wente to hyr  Thenne whan they were to∣fore
Vyenne the frere spake first Madame ye knowe wel that my lord your fader
hath ben a grete whyle in pryson  and yet shold haue been  ne had haue
been  thys moure  whyche hath saued hym  puttyng hys persone in ryght
grete peryl and daun∣ger for the loue of my lord your fader  And thus
ye may wel


      

knowe how moche he is holden to hym  & by cause herof your fa¦der is
subget to hym euer  wher∣fore your fader prayeth you that vpon al the
playsyr that ye wyl doo for hym  that ye wyll take hym for your
husbond  And he shal pardonne all the desplaysyr that euer ye dyd to

by whyche she knewe clerely that he was parys and for the souerayn loue
that she bare to hym  & for the grete Ioye that she had  she began to

swetenes that parys & vyēne demeaned bytwene them she awoke  and whan

thys that ye do  haue ye loste your wytte  that so enbrace this
moure  hath he enchaunted you that ye suffre hym soo famylyer wyth

here is my good frende Pa∣rys whome I haue so moche desy¦red  and for
whome I haue suffred so moche payne & sorowe and fader thys is he that

wythoute knowyng of o∣ny man  And also he hath dely∣uerd you out of
pryson puttyng hys lyf in Ieopardye for you  and whan the doulphyn
vnder∣stood al thys he was meruayl∣lously glad and Ioyous  After al
thys parys went to his fa∣der  & whan he sawe hym and knewe that he was
hys sone pa∣rys  whome he had so longe de∣syred to see  he enbraced

Thenne sayd the doulphyn it playseth me ryght wel onely for thys day 
For to morn I wyl that the maryage of hym & my doughter be made &
solempnysed here  And thenne messyre Ia∣ques wente with hys sone vnto
hys hous  And whan he was there  verayly his fader  his mo¦der  and
hys felowe Edward wyst not where they were for Ioye and playsyr that
they had and that was noo wonder  for they had no moo chyldren but
hym  and he shold wedde the doughter of their lord  and also Parys was
in that tyme become a valyaunte knyght  and ful of al beaulte  and for
many rea∣sons it was no meruayll though they had in hym grete Ioye and
playsyr  & Edward demaun∣ded of hym of hys aduenture  & many other
thynges  And he recounted and tolde hym alle 


        How Parys espoused and wedded vyenne  and of the feste that
        was there made 

THenne on the morn the dolphyn gaf his dough∣ter in maryage to parys And
the feste was moche noble and sumptuous  For moche pe∣ple were comen
thyder for to see the feste  and it endured fyftene dayes  And the
playsyr and so¦lace whyche was doon for the loue of Parys and of vyenne
was soo grete  that vnnethe it may be byleued  whyche parys and Vyenne
lyued to gyder a grete whyle in ryght grete conso¦lacyon and playsyr 
but after thaccomplysshement of the mary¦age  the fader and moder of
pa∣rys lyueden not longe after in thys world  and Parys had by Vyenne
hys wyf thre chyldren  that is to wete two sones & one d••ughter  
And the doulphyn or¦deyned for them moche noble ma¦trymonye 
And parys after the deth of hys fader and his moder wold that Edward hys
dere fe¦lowe shold be herytyer of al the goodes that hys fader lefte and
gaf to hym ysabeau to hys wyf  whyche lyued to gyder longe tyme in
grete loue and concorde  And sone after the doulphyn & hys wyf
deyeden  And thenne was Parys doulyhyn and had the possessyon of al the
seygnou∣rye  the whyche lyued wyth vy∣enne in thys world fourty yere
and ledde a good and holy lyf  in so moche that after thentende∣ment of
somme men they be sayn¦tes in heuen  & they deyed bothe in one yere 
And semblably Ed¦ward and ysabeau deyed bothe tweyne in one yere 
Therfore late vs praye vnto our lord that we may doo suche werkes in
this world  that in suche wyse we


      

may accompanye them in the per¦durable glorye of heuen Amen
