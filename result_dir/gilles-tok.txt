most profit to wete 
for what ende we desireth, 
and for it is iseide, 
ii Ethicorum, 
that likynge is synne 
and tokene of habite igendred, 
as in dedes we haueth diuers habites, 
and haueth likyng in diuers dedes. 
In the thridde wise, 
dedes ben diuers, 
noug[t] onliche 
by endes and habites, 
bote also by passiouns, 
for men of diuers passiouns 
worcheth diuersliche. 
For we | seeth 
that drede and wanhope 
ben oþer passiouns ‡ 
f. p a n is hope. 
For thay that ben in drede 
and in wanhope of the victory 
doth shameliche 
and forsaketh the scheltrum, and fleth out of the bataile; 
and thay that beth in hope 
of the victorie reseth 
and auentureth on here enemyes. 
What is iseide of hope 
and of drede 
ys vnderstonde of o p e r passiouns. 
Al affecciouns and passiouns worchen in vs som inclinacioun 
to do diuers dedes. 
The furthe wise, 
it semeth that maners maketh workes diuers; 
for they that hauen olde men maners 
worcheth and doth o p e r wise p 
a n thay that haueth gonge men maners. 
For as it schal be iseide in his place, 
olde men ben kyndelich ouertrowyng an[d] coueitous, 
and onge men kyndelich trowen sone 
and ben liberal and fre of hert. 
And it semeth pese foure hauen 
a maner proporcioun togedres, 
for of diuers maners cometh diuers passiouns; 
and of diuers passions 
com eth diuers habites; 
and of diuers abites comdp ordinauns 
and of diuerse of desire endes. 
For as olde men maneres 
and onge men maneres ben diuers, 
so theire affecciouns and passiouns ben diuers. 
And as gode men and euel men haueþ diuers maneres 
so thaire habites ben diuers. 
Also by diuers habites, 
we ordeineth to vs diuers endes. 
For as it is iseide, iii Ethicorum, 
þat suche as eueriche man is, 
soche an ende pleseth hym. 
As to the intemperate, 
that is he that folweth p e lustus of flesch, 
that is an intemporate man, 
it semeth that al the ende and gret felicite 
is in seruice of Venus. 
And also pey pat haue o p e r habites 
ben inclined and desirede endes, 
accordyng to thaire habites. 
Panne in the furste book 
we schullen trete of al these foure: 
and first of the ende and felicite of princes, 
and of thaire vertues, passiouns, and maners. 
Bote firste, 
we schal speke of the ende o p e r of felicite for in doyng 
and in actyue mater 
the ende is | more chief principal 
þan eny of the other. col. r Chapter III 
For as it is iseid 
we taketh this work 
by cause of lore, 
and no man lerneth atte wille, 
but he be wel willed, 
abel to lerne, 
and takyng gode hede. 
After that in the firste chapitre we made p 
e kynges maiestee wel willed, 
schewyng pat we schollen esylich trete kynges p 
a t schollen be isayd; 
and in p e seconde chapitre we made p e kynges maieste able to lerne, 
tellyng the ordre of þynges p a t schal be iseide; 
it is to doynge 
in this þridde chapitre 
that we make to take hede and goode entent, 
declaryng how grete profite is in thinges 
that schal be isaide. 
For comonliche men hateþ harde speche and strange, 
as meny scolers bien wel iwelled to ham 
pat speketh esy speche and pleyn. 
And t h e y that bien corrumpt appetite, 
des[i]re, 
in other sciens, 
t in moral matier of the whoche the maner of the mater axeth boistous tretyng and figurai, 
it is n o u t corrumpt appetite, 
bote more right ordre and due. 
Panne in suche art 
the scoler is made wel willed 
by light and esi maner spekyng, 
and is imade abel to lerne 
by the order of thinges 
that schal be iseid. 
For nameliche a scoler is imade abel to lerne 
if the thinges 
that schal be iseide 
ben itolde 
and irekened to hym are we. 
By profite of thinges 
p a t schal be iseide 
p e scoler is imade take hede, 
if he hopeth to hire thing 
that is good and profitable. 
By the thinges that schal be iseid, 
if pey ben wel iknowen and dueliche ikept and holde, 
the kyng schal haue foure, 
as it longeth to this worke, 
p e whoche foure eueriche man schal most loue and desire. First, 
a schal wynne the beste goodes; 
p e secunde, 
schal wynne hymself; 
p e þridde, 
a schal wynne other men; 
þe | fourjthe, 
he schal wynne f. 
and haue Goode hymself 
and felicite withoute ende. 
And goodes destingueth in on wise, 
for ‡som is good, 
and som is better, 
and som is best. 
Otter good is good, 
and inward good is better, 
and may be comyn to goode men and euel; 
as wisdome, konnyng, 
and kynde wit, 
and vertues of the saule. 
In this goode men and euel beth parteners. 
Pe best gode is inward gode, 
and euel men 
b e s t n o u g t partiners therof; 
and gode vertues beth soche gode. 
For as holy seyntes and philosofres meneth no man mesvseth vertues, 
perfore primo Rethoricorum, 
it is iseid 
that onlich vertues ben 
n o u g t mysvsed. 
And other wise gode is destyngued 
as p e philosofer meneth tarn 
in Magnis Moralibus quam in Ethicis, 
for som good is likyng 
and som is profitable 
and som is honest. 
Honest good is excellent gode, 
for as he seith, 
in honest gode 
is closed likyng and profite; 
for if p e gode is honest, 
he conteyneth grete likyng and profite. 
Thanne for in this 
n what maner þe kynge 
may be imade honest and vertuous 
and how a shal brynge 
his sugettes 
to honeste and to vertues, 
Jeanne in thinges 
[that shal be iseide] 
is most profit, 
for therby, 
yf they ben ykept, 
is igete chef gode and honeste. Pe seconde, 
in thinges 
that shal be iseide is most profit, 
for therby man wynneth n o u t [onliche] the cheef gode, 
bote also a wynneth hymself. 
[It] is ofte iseid moral matier is ivsed 
for we sholde be gode. 
A good man hath hymself 
and an euel man hath n o u g t hymself. 
We schal J imagine in pis wise: 
as in regne and a citee meny bep iordeyned vnder on due and vnder kyng, 
so in one and in the same man ‡vertues p a t bien partiners of resoun | ben iordeined vnder the inwit 
p a t is col. resonable of itself. 
Panne as it is n o u g t iseide 
þat a kyng hap the regne, 
nother a due hath the cite, 
sif ther is strif and descencioun in the regne 
oþer in the cite, 
oþer sif the men of the regne and of the citee ben V Part I 
nougt obedient to the kyng nother to p e duke; 
so it is singulerliche iseide, 
that som man hath nougt hymself 
sif his appetite, desire, 
is contrary to resoun, 
and the partiners of resoun 
ben nougt obedient to the chief vertu of resoun. 
By p e philosofer, ix Ethicorum, 
man is most vnderstondyng and resoun. 
Pan yf resoun is nougt maister of thinges 
þat ben in man, 
man is nougt lord of hymself, 
nother ruleth, 
nother hath hymself properliche for to speke, 
bote he wol on bi resoun 
and the contrari 
by passione idrawe 
and inclined in that wyse. 
Pan sif an euel man hath nougt hymself, 
and þe gode man hath hymself, 
by p e sciens pat m a k e p vs gode, 
a man wenneth hymself. 
Pe þridde, 
a wynneth other men. 
For sif a rector, gouernour, ruleth hymself, 
a ‡ is worthi to be made rector, gouernour, 
and lord of other men. 
For he that hath wisdom and redynes 
and other moral vertues, 
of the whoche it is itreted in this boke, 
is worthi to be a prince. 
And if hym lakketh this redines, 
peys he be a prince 
by ciuyle, temporel, myte and strengte, 
put a sis more worthi 
to be a sogette 
þan a prince 
oþer a lord, 
and he is more kyndeliche seruant 
p a n a lord. 
Pe furthe, 
gif we holdeth and kepeth 
p e lore 
that is itaut in this boke, 
we shal gete and haue God hymself and felicite, 
blis withoute ende. 
For God is essencia, 
beyng in vnite or onhede; 
for he is most on and gode. 
And the more a man neigheth to vnite and to godenes, 
the more a is accordyng to p 
e first principium, 
bygynnyng, 
that is God, | f. 
and a parfite man hath Gode. 
And euel men beþ nougt ioned with God, 
for al here kyngdom is departed and toschatered. 
For eueriche mannis regne stondeth in pat 
that the myghtes and vertues of the soule 
beth iruled 
by wit and resoun. 
Panne sif resoun techeth 
on and þe appe[t]ite an nother, 
and d o p the contrary and asens resoun, 
as it fareth in men with euel soules, 
þsanne þe man is nougt ioned, 
bote hath descencioun, 
strif withinne hymself, 
and is vnlich to God. 
Bote hy that bien excellent in vertues and habundant, 
that is plentyuouse, 
in honeste gode, 
for a folweth p e rule of resoun and gode 
þat is verrey good, 
an[d] haueth sencible good in hamself, 
and vnite and goodnes 
and beth therefoure accordyng to God, 
and it is acounted 
that thei hauen Good within hamself, 
þeanne in the matir p 
a t schal be saide is so gret profite, 
p a t gif we do þserby, 
we schal wynne moche goode and chief goode, 
vsself and other, 
and we schal haue God hymself and felicite withoute ende. 
Bote for the thinges 
that we schal teche 
may nougt be ikept 
and iholde withoute grace of God, 
it is semelich p a t eueriche man, 
and namelich p e kyng, 
praye and byseche p e g r a c e of God. 
For the more highe the kyng is aboue 
o p e r men 
p e more nede he hath to praye grace of God, that a may vse dedes of vertues, 
and brynge his sogettes to vertues. 
r The Governance of K i n g s a n d P 
r i n c e s Chapter IV 
After certeyn préambule forseid thinges 
that beth nedeful to this purpos, 
how by list esy maner 
tretyng 
of this worke 
we maketh the kyng wel willed, 
and by ordre of thinges 
that schal be iseid 
we maketh hym abel, 
and by profite 
that is ifounde gerinne we | maketh hym take col. intent 
and good hede fcerto, 
now it is to telle al arewe kynges of dedes, 
as it is iseid tofore honde, 
garnie † the resounf schal 
bygynne tretyng of the ende and of felicite. 
And for þer bien diuers maneres of leuyng, 
dyuers men ordeyneth to hamsilf 
dyuersliche diuers endes, 
þe maners of leuyng schal be irekened, 
and it schal be ischowed 
how felicite schal be iset gerinne. 
As the philosofre seith, primo Ethicorum, 
philosofres distingueth thre maner of leuyng: voluptuose, politik, and contemplatiue. 
For he seith þat man is mené 
bytwene the ouer thyng and þe nether, 
for man is kyndelich mene 
bytwene oþcer bestes and angels 
and is bynethe angels and aboue other bestes. 
Panne we may take hede of man in thre wise: furst, 
as a comuneth with other bestes; 
þe secunde, 
as man is som what in hymself; 
þe þridde, 
as man comuneth 
and is partyner with angels. 
By these þre consideraciouns philosofres taketh 
þe forsaide 
þre maner of leuyng 
and meneth that mannes leuyng 
þat leueth 
as an other best is voluptuouse, 
and hys lyf that leueth 
as he is som what in hymself is pollitic lif, 
and his lif that leueth 
as comunyng with angels 
is lyf contemplatif. 
Panne eueriche man leueth 
as anoþer beste, 
oþer as a man, 
oþer as ang[e]ls. 
For he that leueth by voluptuose lyf, 
a lyueth as other bestes; 
and by cyuyl lyf, 
[a lyueth as a man; 
and by] contempla­ tif e, 
as an angel. 
Philosofres distyngueth these þre maners of leuyng 
and setteth bote twey maner of felicite. 
For a denyeth that felicite 
is in voluptuose lyf, 
and so doth dyuynes also, 
and setteth double felicite, 
politik and con­ templatif. 
And so he is icleped felix 
þat hath felicite 
(pat is to say bless­ ednesse) 
as a man, 
[and hath] in hymself redines 
and right|ful reson f. of doyng and of dedes. 
And he is felix contemplatif that hath felicite aboue mankynde, 
and hath felicitée nougt onlych as man 
bote hath som what that longeth to God, 
and is beter þan man. 
P anne philos­ ophres clepeth hym 
þat is parfite 
in doyng and dedes felix, 
and hym that hath felicite contemplatif 
a clepeth nouöt man 
bote beter þan man. 
For doyng and comunyng in dedes 
[with] other is in man, 
in þat a is a man; 
bote speculacioun and knowlich of sothenes 
ys in a man 
in that a hath speculatif wit, 
that is som dele godlich, and comuneth tharby wyth God 
and with angelis. 
And so, primo Poleticorum, 
it is iseide 
that eueriche man 
is ‡ oþur wors than man 
and is þan a beste, 
other a is better þan man 
and is ┌ ┐ ┌ ┐ v þa Part I 
som what goodeliche 
and an half goode. 
And gif a is man, 
what is man? 
And it is ipreued man 
is a compaynable beste, 
and ciuile and politike, 
and lyueth p a n politik lif, 
þat is to say, 
a wise lif 
and iruled by redines 
and by resoun. 
Bote gif a es a beste and wors þan man, 
p a n a is nougt ireuled by redynes 
and by resoun bote by passyoun, 
and leueth voluptuose lif, 
that is a wilful lyf. 
Bote gif a ys godeliche and better p a n man, 
þeannea hath contemplacioun 
by wit and wisdom 
and lyueth contemplatiue lif. 
Panne bytwene hym 
that is wis and redy in actiue doynges and dedes and hym 
that is parfite in speculacion, 
p a t is in sight, 
is as gret differens 
as is betwene politik [lif of man] 
and contemplatif lif of angels. 
Pey that bien iseue to worlych dedes bien ofte destourbed in many thinges, 
for diuers doynges p a t fallen, 
and feleth of passions of the flesche 
as for the more parte. 
Bote thei 
that bien iseue to speculacioun, 
that is to say schowyng maters, 
bien som del withdrawe 
fro suche passy|ons. 
And for lyue in flesch 
and nougt by the flesch 
is more angels 
col. doyng p a n manys doyng, 
and philosofres clepeth hym felix 
that leueth in contemplacioun, 
and nougt in polletic felicite 
and as a man, 
bote that a comuneth with holy angels. 
Panne wise men and spéculatif schal be iworschepped, 
for they ben isette aboue a man. 
Panne so of maneres of leuyng 
and of felicite þat is ifounde tharinne, 
philosofres distyngueth. 
Bote þei myst nougt come to p e sothe atte folle, 
and in al maner wise. 
For p e i s thei seide sothlich 
that felicite schal nougt be isougt 
in voluptees lyf, 
p a t is a wilful lyf, 
as it shal be iseide more clerelich withinne, 
bote of politik lyf, 
that dyuynes clepeth actyue lyf, 
and of contemplatif lif, 
soche philosoferfes] mened nougt al sothe and trouthe atte folle. 
For thei trowed that man myst voide alle synnes by pure kynde doyng, 
with[oute] other helpe of grace, 
and lyue parfiteliche in actif 
lyf other contemplatif lyue. 
Bote that is fais, 
as it is iseid tofore hond, 
al þat wol [ly]ue ritfullich 
nedeth Goddes grace, 
and namelich kynges and rulers of other men. 
Also thei sette contemplatif lyue 
in pure speculacioun, 
and that is fais; 
for neuer man is parfite, 
by suche a lyf, 
bote he haue in hym loue 
in God and charité. 
In this thei mened nougt arist; 
bote in that thei seide 
that contemplatif lif 
is better than politik lif other actif, 
thei accordeth with diuynes 
and with rist fey of Holy Cherche. 
Now this is ido, say we, 
that it semeth a kyng 
to knowe these maneres of leuyng, 
and to fle voluptuos lif, 
that he be nougt wors 
p a n m a n , 
for as it is iseide, primo Ethicorum, 
soche cheseth lyf of bestes. 
Bote a kyng schal haue 
in hymself 
bothe actif lyf and contemplatif, 
þat a may rule his sugettes 
by actif lyf, 
and profite to hymself by contemplatif lif 
and inward deuocioun and loue of God. 
I Pis inward deuocioun 
is the more nedeful to kynges and f. princes, 
for he shal seue rekenyng of meny doyng 
dedes tofore the heighest iuge. 
r Chapter V 
It is ful besylich to wetyng 
that as by thew transmutacions and chaungynges mater cometh to perfeccioun and forme, 
so by rigtful and [th]ewe workes 
and dedes man cometh 
to his perfeccioun and felicite. 
Panne for man worcheth neuer arist 
as it nedeth for to come to p e ende bote a knowe the ende, 
[and] wol come to his ende 
and to his felicite, 
it is spedful to knowe his ende 
and his felicite. 
As it longeJD to pis work, 
we may bi twey weyes declar[e] 
p a t it is spedful 
to a kyng 
to knowe his ende. 
Pe furste is for by his workes 
and dedes he cometh to his ende. 
Pe seconde wey, 
for the kyng schal reule oþer men. 
Pe furste wey is declared in this wise. 
For to come to gode ende 
by workes and dedes 
p r e thinges ben nedeful: 
þe firste is to do wel, 
p e secounde to do by eleccioun 
an[d] freliche, 
the þridde to do with likyng. 
For sif man doth euel 
and nougt wel a cometh nougt to gode ende 
bote to þe contrary of the ende. 
For as it is iseide, 
ii Phisicorum, 
the ende is nougt 
onlich the laste bote 
also som what pat is beste. 
Perfore, ii Methaphisicorum, 
þe philosofer meneth the ende 
and gode is al one, 
and who þat bynemeth ende 
bynemeth al gode and profite. 
And so gif thei 
that don euel ben worthi 
to haue euel and harme, 
for euel is contrary to good, 
and so to the ende, 
euel doers, 
in p a t p a t ben suche, 
ben nougt worthi to haue goode ende bote the contrary of gode ende. 
And also nout onlich euel doers failleþ of the ende, 
but also p e i that may do wel; 
bote a do wel he schal nougt haue p e corone noþer 
p e ende of felicite, 
p a t is to say blessednesse. 
And so, primo Ethicorum, 
p e philosofer seith in Olympiadibus, 
that is to menyng in p e strong bataille, 
p a t [h]o hatte 
p e strengeste men | bien nougt [corouned] 
bote thei 
that col. fighten and don dedes of maystry, 
and sif p e i fiften nougt in dede thei schul nougt haue p e coroune; 
p a n it nedeth to worche in dede, 
p a t we may by [ou]re workes be worthi 
to haue the ende an[d] felicite, 
J^at is blessednes. 
Pe secunde, 
it nedeth that thei worche 
by eleccioun and freliche; 
for who p a t d o p wel by hap is nougt ipreysed 
for his dedes nother wynneth þerby 
p e ende nother felicite. 
For dedes þat cometh nougt of fre eleccioun bien nougt wilful. 
And, 
as the philosofer seith, 
iii Ethicorum, 
for vnwilful dedes we ben nougt ipreysed nother iblamed, 
and so p e r it is iseid 
that no man is holy bote willyng. 
Bot what we doun nougt by eleccioun, 
we doun nougt willing. 
Proprelich to speke of soche dedes, 
in that þei bien soche, 
þerby we cometh nougt to felicite. 
A vertue is an habite of choys 
and is in the myddel, 
as it is iseide, 
ii Ethicorum; 
p e dedes 
by the whoch we comen to p 
e ende mote come of eleccioun. 
Pe þridde, 
that [m]e mote worche 
with his likyng, 
for the more likyng 
a man hath in a dede, 
the more wilfulliche a doth p a t d e d e and with habite of vertue. 
And so, ii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer meneth p a t it Part I is nougt ynouwe to do gode, 
bote wel; 
nothere it suffiseth nout to do ritful dedes, 
bote it nedeth to do rithfulliche. 
Fore it happeth 
that schrewes doun gode dedes 
bote for thei doun ham nout wel and with likyng, 
it nedeth noug that thei come tharby to p e ende and to felicite, 
bat is blessednes. 
Panne whanne these thre cometh ifere, 
that we doþ ode 
and by eleccioun 
and with likyng, 
namelich in that wise we cometh to ende, 
and these falleth moste gif it is iknowe. 
Thanne to come to p e ende, 
it is spedful to knowe the ende. 
And we shal ymagine in þis wise 
that in causes that worcheth, 
p e secunde worcher worcheth 
by vertue of þe furste worcher, 
so þe secondari endes meueth 
by vertue of p e last ende; 
þarfore as gif þer 
were no worcher | furste, 
þanne no worcher f. scholde worche 
so gif þer were no laste ende 
and gif we hadde nougt in fought 
as laste gode and final to meve the wille. [And noon oþer to gode may mevefcewille.] 
For al þat þe wil [wol], 
he wol it is in order to som what that a wol 
for laste and fynal ende. 
Panne gif nougt is in thought desired as fynal ende, 
þanne a worcheth nogt wel nother doþ wel; 
for gif it were so, 
þanne scholde cesse al dedes of mankynde. 
Panne to worche, 
we moste ordeyne for what ende; 
bote for to worche and do wel, 
we moste worche and do for a gode ende, 
for the ende makeþ oure dedes gode oþer euel, 
for no dede may be gode gif it is iordeyned for an euel ende. 
Panne for to do wel it 
nedeth to knowe þe ende. 
Pe seconde, suche knowleche nedeth 
þat we may worche by eleccioun. 
For as archers 
þat seeth not the mark, 
þeigh he hitte p e marke, 
þat is bote his happe. 
So thei that knoweth nout the ende, 
thei a do wel and come to p e ende, 
þat is nout by aleccioun, 
bote by hap. 
Perfore þe philosofer wol mené 
þat al knowleche of the ende is nedeful, 
for knowleche of p e ende 
is a gret helpe to oure lyf for to come to þe ende, 
as an archers knowyng a mark cometh 
p e rather to what hem nedeth. 
Pe þridde, 
knowlich of p e ende makeþ vs nout 
onlich do wel 
[and by eleccioun] 
bote also likyngliche; 
for eny workes and dedes beth imade likyng and swete 
by consideracioun of welþe and felicite 
þat cometh þerof. 
Thanne to worche and do wel 
and by eleccioun 
and with likyng, 
it is spedful to eueriche man 
to knowe his felicite 
and is nameliche spedefol 
to a kyng 
þat schal 
in his dedes take hede to p e comyn profite that is better and | more goodelich J^an eny 
that is a col. singuler profite. 
And so it is most semeliche p a t a kyng knowe his felicite, 
that a may vse wel and with likyng 
and by eleccioun 
p e comyn dedes 
þat beth as it were som dele Goddes dedes. 
Pe secunde, p e same, 
for þe kyng schal rule oþer. 
Theigh the arwe se nout þe mark, 
[nathales þe arwe hitteþ þe 
mark,] 
for the archere scheteth and ruleth þe schot to the mark. 
Panne as it is more spedefol V 
that the archere se the mark þan the arwe se the mark, 
for he ruleth pe schot 
and the arwe to þe mark, 
so it is more spidefol 
þat a kyng knowe þe ende and felicite 
þan it is 
þat pe poeple knowe it, 
for þe kyng ruleth þe poeple. Chapter VI Comunliche pe comyn puple perseiueth nougt bote sencible delec­ tations, 
þat is felyng delectacioun and likyngs, 
and perfore it is p a t comynliche delectacions and likyngs 
þat bep most sencible we clepeth delectacions and voluptuositees, 
as delectacions and likyng of touche and of taste, 
þeig likyng of inwit and spirituale be better and more ex­ cellent withoute comparisoun, 
properliche for to speke, 
[þan sencible voluptuositees]. 
P anne felicite schal nougt be isette 
in suche sencible dileccions 
and likyng 
offlesche,we may declare by p r e weyes. 
As it longeth to pis work felicite meneth pre: 
parfite good and suffi­ saunt by hitself; 
for þan man is felix 
whanne he hath p a t thing 
in pe whoche 
is his parfite gode; 
and so þe philosofer, 
[i] Ethicorum, 
descryu­ eth felicite and seith 
that felicite is ende of workes and dedes, 
parfite gode and suffisaunt by hitself. 
And of this furste folweth þe secounde, 
þat felicite is som what after resoun 
and as resoun demeth. 
And for gode þat is after resoun 
in þe whiche is parfyte and verrey gode, 
and sencible gode is gode 
for som what and for a tyme, 
garnie gif felicite is parfite gode, 
a mot be intel­ 
lectu|ale gode and resounhabel, 
o p e r is the same, 
and mote be soche f. gode 
as rigt resoun demeth 
for to haue. 
And here of folweth pe þridde, 
p a t felicite is gode 
of pe soule 
and nougt of pe body. 
And for the body is ordeyned to pe saule 
as mater to pe fourme 
and vnparfite þyng 
to his perfeccioun, 
bote goode of the body is vnparfite in comparisoun to gode of pe soule, 
perfore resoun demeth nougt to gete suche goode 
in that wise as gode of pe saule. 
Panne for ‡ felicite ys parfite good, 
it is g o o d of the saule 
and of re­ soun. 
For parfite gode of man stondeth 
in worching of the saule by resoun, 
as it is declared, primo Ethicorum. 
Panne for voluptuose likyng 
and sencible delectacioun 
is nought parfite gode nother goode of the saule and of resoun, 
garnie it is openliche iknowe 
that felicite schold nougt be iset 
in soche delectaciouns and likyng. 
Pat soche voluptuos­ ite, 
þat is wil and delectacions, 
is nougt parfite gode and suffisaunt hit 
may be sone iknowe, 
for soche gode fulfilleth the appetite, 
and soche voluptuose delectacions, 
þat is delit, 
may nougt fulfille pe appetite 
as eueriche man may fele in hymself. 
And so, iii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer speketh of soche delectacions, 
and seith þat pe delicate appetite 
may nougt [be] fulfilled. 
┌ ┐ r Part I 
Pe secounde, felicite schal n o u g 
t be isette in soche delectaciouns, 
and seith for thei ben 
n o u g t gode by resoun 
bote thei bene more sencible gode 
and gode of resoun, 
the more þey bien,

For by resoun, 
what letteth resoun is inconuenient; 
bote soche sencible delectaciouns, 
sif þei bien strong, 
a blendeth resoun 
as it is iseide, 
iii Ethicorum, 
in this wise, 
sif suche dilecciouns bien grete and strong and smiteth resoun. 
Pe þridde, felicitée | schal 
n o u g 
t be iset in sencible delectacions, 
for col. soche is more gode of the body 
p a n of the sowie. 
Panne for the body is iordeyned 
to pe soule a[nd]

þan sif felicite is fynal gode 
to the whoche oper gode is iordeyned,

p a t beth the gode of p e body, 
bote more in workes 
and dedes of vertues 
p a t beth p e gode of the saule. 
And we may saye that theigh som delectaciouns 
be leeffol and honest, 
for dedes of vertue [ben] 
fol likyng to a good man and vertuouse, 
k none delectacioun ese ileche felicite, 
þei it may be som what pat folweth felicite. 
Bote þe declaracioun p e r o f longeth 
n o u g t to this present worke. 
But notheles, 
o cause sum what ]erof schal be yseyde in[ne]rmore, 
but notheles it is y 
n o w to wite pat it is n o g t h semelich for a man to sette is felicite 
in sencible delectaciouns. 
Pan it is detestable and horrible to euerich man to sette 
is felicite in voluptuose delectaciouns, 
and is most detestable 
and horrible to a kyng. 
And þat may be declared by p r e weyes: 
þe furste, 
soche thinges bep deceytes 
and horrible to a kyng, 
for ‡soche abateth moste 
and bereth hym doun. 
Pe secunde, 
fore thei maken hym be despised 
and lyte itolde of. 
Pefcridde,for a maketh hym vnworthy to be a prince. 
Hit is iseide tofore 
that in voluptuouse lyf we accordeth with other bestes. 
And thei that desireth to lyue 
in that wise cheseth p e lif of vnresonable bestes. 
Panne in þe more his state a man is, 
þe more he is ibore idoune 
by his lif. 
For it is iseide 
that it semeth a kyng 
and a prince 
to be aboue man, 
and al fol lord, 
for it is seide, 
v Poleticorum, 
þat a principate schal answere 
to the quantité and worthines 
so p a t p 
e more grete prince a ‡ man is, 
þe more he schal passe 
o p e r | in worthines 
and in dignité of lyf f. 
and in quantité of godenes. 
Panne it is vnworthi 
that he 
that is so grete a gre scholde chese the maner lyuyng of vnresonable bestes, 
for þerby he is swithe ibore dounward. 
Pe secounde, 
p a t maketh þe kyng despised 
and litel isette 
by is detestable to hym. Perfore, v Poleticorum, 
p e philosofer seith that it is most spedefol to princes 
to be moderate 
in bodilich delectacions and likyng, 
and seith thare that thei that haueth ham to soche delectacions 
and likyng beth liehe to dronken men 
and to slepyng men. 
For thei that e u e t h ham to soche likynge leseth 
pe vse of resoun 
as doth slepyng men and dronken men and mowe n o u t vse resoun, 
and he seith that the sobre man 
is n o u t sone despised, 
bote pe dronken man; 
nother v the wakyng man 
is sone despised 
bote þe slepyng man. 
Panne it semeth a kyng to voide 
and forsake soche 
inmoderate likyng 
þat a seme nout contemptible, 
that is despisyng and worthi to be despised. 
Pe þridde, 
it semeth a prince 
þat soche finges be despised, 
lest he by come unworþi to be prince]. 
For no man cheseth gungelynges 
to be dukes, 
for it is vnworthy 
þat a childe be a prince. 
Bote as it is iseide, 
primo Ethicorum, 
no differens is bytwene a child of ong age 
and one with maneres of ong age, 
for on þat vseth soche likyng. 
For thei he be olde of tyme and of age, 
for a is a child in maneres, 
he [is] vnworthi to be a prince. 
Panne it is diligentlich to wetyng 
þat as a child of age 
and a childe of maneres 
bien nout diuers 
to be olde of age and of maneres, 
perfore an olde man of age 
and childe of maneres is vnworthi to be a prince, 
so a childe of age and olde of maneres 
is worthi to be a prince. 
For the philosofer seith nout 
that no man cheseth cheldren to be dukes, 
for it is iknowe 
that they ben nout wise, 
bote for it is nout iknowe 
þat thei bien wise. 
Parfor if it is iknowe 
þat thei hauen olde maneres 
and bien wise | and redy, 
it is worthi that thei be princes, 
col. Panne by this the conclusioun of p e chapiter, 
that a prince be nout ibore doun nofcer contempte and despised, 
nother be vnworthy to be prince, 
a schal despise inmoderate and voluptuose likynge. Chapter VII Pe philosofer, Politicorum primo, 
distingueth twey maner of riches, 
and meneth that som maner of riches is kyndelich, 
and som is crafty riches. 
Kyndelych riches is icleped 
þat comeþ kyndelich of kyndelich thinges, 
as what cometh of feldes 
oþer of treen, 
as corne and wyne, 
olper of bestes; 
also generallich al that serueth to mete and drynke 
and cloþyng 
ys acounted among kyndeliche riches. 
Crafty riches is ifounde by crafte 
and by wit and ordinans of men ichaunged for kyndeliche riches 
as gold and siluer and al maner money 
þat releueth nout by hamself bodylich nedes, 
bote by chaungyng 
a helpeth and releueth in bodelich nedes. 
Pei gold and siluer be kynde metal 
k f^ei hauen crafty riches. 
In nother richesse schal felicite be iset. 
Primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer toucheth thre by p 
e whoche we may declare 
þat felicite schal nout be iset in crafty riches. 
First, 
for craftes is iordeyned 
to kynde riche[s]; 
pe secunde, 
for soche riches 
is imade riches 
by manis ordynans; 
þe þridde, 
for a releueth not bodelich nede 
by kynde þerof. 
Hit is iseid tofore þat felicite schal be iset in þat gode to 
\>e which þer good is iordened; ‡and so, 
for crafti is iordeyned 
to kynde richesse, 
crafti riches may nout haue 
p e reson of felicite. 
Pe secounde, 
p a n felicite schal nout be isette in soche riches, 
for it is nout dehese bote by ordinauns of men. 
Bote oure verrey felicite is oure goode by itself, 
and nout by ordinauns of men onlich. Money is PartI riches 
by ordenans of men, 
and so, primo Poleticorum, 
it is iseid 
þat gif disposicioun of men 
þat vseþ [were ichaunged], 
oþer [gi]f pe ordre and disposicioun [of men] were ichaunged, 
þan were suche richesse nout worgt; 
for þat so moche money is worthy | 
so moche whete, 
þat is by f. ordynance of men and for men 
þat vseth money wol and ordeyneth 
þat it be so. 
Pe þridde, 
that in soche riches schal nout felicite be isette; 
for nother gold ne siluer, 
nother money nougt onlich fulfilleth noght the saule 
nother his parfite goode, 
bote also a releueth nout 
by hamsilf bodylich nede. 
Hit may happe 
as it is iseide, 
primo Polleticorum, 
that a riche man of money 
deyeth for hunger. 
And fcat hit is iseide of on Meda, 
þat was swithe coueitous of golde, 
and as it is iseide in fables, 
he preyed god 
and hadde it igraunte 
þat al þat he touched schulde torne to gold, 
and for the touche is in every party of the body 
he myt touche no thing 
in his mouthe 
bote it tornede in to gold, 
and so he was a riche man of gold 
and deide git for honger. 
And that myt nougt be if gold and money were verrey riches 
and releuede verreyliche bodiliche nede. 
And for money is riches in order to oþer richesse 
and also for money is riches by ordinauns of men, 
also þeig a be bodiliche, 
money is nout suffisaunt 
by itself 
to relyue bodiliche nede, 
þanne felicite schal nout be iset tharinne. 
And that felicite schal [nout] 
be iset in kynde riches 
as in mete and drynke, 
and in soche thinges 
þat releueth hamself bodiliche nede, 
it may sone be declared. 
For by cause þat felicite 
is the beste goode, 
it schal be isout 
in [the beste] party of vs. Panne 
for the saule 
is better þan pe body, 
felicite schal nout be iset in þat þat is þe goode of the body. 
Bote as it is isaide felicite schal be iset 
in dedes of vertues 
and þat is the goode of pe soule. 
Panne to eueriche man 
it is detestable and horribele 
to sette his félicitée in riches, 
and to a kyng 
it is most detestable and horrible 
to sette his felicite on riches. 
For [if] a kyng olpev a prince 
setteth his felicite in riches, 
p r e grete harmes cometh þerof. 
Pe furste, 
þat he leseth grete thinges; 
pe seconde, 
þat he is 
i|mad a tiraunt; 
the þridde, 
þat he aspoileþ pe poeple. col. He þat loueth 
as for pe fynal ende 
and dredeth to eue money 
may neuer be magnifiais 
man of grete expens and cost, 
nother a may be magnanimus, 
for he þat dredeth to luse money 
vndertaketh none grete dedes. Panne, 
for he is magnanimus 
þat holdeth no bodilich thing 
grete as pe philosofer meneth, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
capitulo De Magnanimitate. 
For a coueitouse man 
þat setteth his félicitée 
in riches holdeth riches a gret thing, 
soche one may nout be magnanimus. 
And for magnificencia, 
pe vertue of grete spens and cost, 
and magnanimitas, 
þe vertue of grete vndertakyng, 
ben moste goode and most semeliche to a kyng, 
þanne it is detestable 
and horrible to hym 
to sette his félicitée in riches. 
r The Governance of K i n g s a n d P 
r i n c e s Pe seconde, 
it is detestable to a kyng 
oper to a prince 
to sette his felicite in riches, 
for garnie a ys imade a tyraunt. 
For ther is diuersite 
bytwene a kyng and a tyraunt 
as it schal be declared 
in pe þridde book, 
þer it schal be treted of gouernans 
and reulyng of rengnes. 
He is propreliche a kyng 
pat setteth his entent 
on profite of pe regne 
and of pe comyn profite. 
And gif his entent be iset 
on his owne profit, 
þat folweth þat oþer. 
Bote a tyraunt dop pe contrary, 
for his entent is principaliche 
on his owne profite. 
And gif his entent 
is on pe comyn profite, 
pat is by cause of his owne profite 
and loueth most his owne profit. 
He pat setteth his felicite 
in money principallych 
wol gadre money 
and tresour to hymself, 
and is therfore a tyraunt and nout a kyng, 
for his entent is nout principalich on pe comyn profite bote on his owne. 
Pe jDridde, 
gif it were so 
pat the kyng spoilede pe puple, 
for the ende is so iloued pat eueriche man studieth 
to com to his felicite 
in al maner wise 
þat a can and may, 
þan he þat setteth his felicite in riches reccheth nout þeigh | 
a pile wedewes and fader 
and moderles children 
and f. spoile pe comonte and pe regne 
while he may gadre money. 
He þat knoweth what pe ende is to menyng knoweth 
pat a man fondeth 
in al maner wise 
that he may come to his ende. 
Panne a kyng is a tyraunt gif he wol be a lord 
and nout helpe a comyn profite, 
bote spoileth the poeple 
and dop ham no gode bote harme. 
And so [i]f hit is [dletestable and horryble to a kyng 
to luse pe beste gode 
and be a tyraunt and a |ef, 
it is detestable and horrible to hym 
and sette his félicitée in riches. V Chapter VIII 
On cause meny men 
þat leueth most politik 
lif weneth and troweth þat ‡felicite 
schal be isette in worshippe - 
for citeseyns, 
for the moste dele, moste desireth worschippe. 
In worschep p r e beth to knowyng 
by the whoche we may by p r e weyes declare pat felicite schal nougt be iset in worschippe. 
Pe furste, 
for worscheppe is gode iordeyned to other; 
þe seconde, worschippe is outward good; 
pe þridde, 
worschippe is more in hym 
that worscheppeth þan in hym pat is iworschepped. 
Bote felicite is nout goode iordeyned to oþer, 
bote felicite is gode 
to pe whoche oþer gode is iordeyned, 
and is nout outward gode 
bote inward gode, 
and ys in hym pat is felix and hath felicite. 
Pat worschippe is gode iordeyned to oþer pe philosofer witnesseth, primo Ethicorum, 
and seith pat worschippe 
is doyng of reuerence and witnes of vertue, 
þat for men desireth most to be worschepped 
for to seme 
and be holde wise and vertues, 
for soche men beth moste worthi to haue worschippe. 
Perfore pe philosofer | seith that no man telleth pris to be col. worshepped of children, 
for here reuerens is nout suffisaunt witnes of wisdom and of vertu. 
Perfore gif worschep is good iordeyned to PartI vertues, 
felicite schal nougt be iset in worschip bote rather in vertues 
other in dedes of vertues. Pe secunde, felicite schal nougt be isett in worschepe, 
for worschepe is outward gode 
and nougt inward goode. 
It is iseide 
p a t worschipe is reuerens ido in tokene 
o[r] witnes of vertue; 
and tokene and witnes mot be openlich and iknow, 
yf a schal make the thyng 
p a t he witnesseth fol knowe. 
And inward thinges beth nougt iknowe 
to vs bote outwarde thinges, 
for we knoweth nougt what a man thinketh on his herte, 
bote [w]e knoweth what reuerens presenteth withoute. 
Panne pe reuerens, 
p a t is worschepe, 
gif a schal showe his vertue to wham it is ido, 
it suffiseth nougt 
p a t it be in þougt 
and in herte bote it be is[h]owed outward, 
and worschipe is outward gode 
for it is reuerens ido 
by outward tokenes and signes; 
wharfore, gif felicite schal nougt be iset in outter gode, 
þat is pe lasse goode, 
bote inner gode, 
p a t is pe more goode, 
p a n felicite schal nougt be iset in worschipe. 
Pe þridde, 
p a t same is ipreued, 
for worschepe is more in hym 
þat worschepith p a n in hym 
p a t is iworschepped, 
as pe philosofer seith, primo Ethicorum. 
Wherefore gif félicitée 
is iset in worschep, 
p a n happeth p a t horrible peruersite p a t [felicítele is more in hym p 
a t is iworschepped 
p a n in hym p 
a t worscheppeth. 
And as it is seide in a prouerbe, 
ientry is in hym 
þat d o p it, 
so worscheppe is more in hym p 
a t doth worscheppe þan in hym p 
a t is iworschepped. 
And this is openlich iknowe, 
for gif a man loteþ 
to another 
and d o p hym worschepe, 
he þat louteþ is the worschep in hym 
that louteth and nougt | f. 
in hym to wham pe loutyng is imade to, 
for pe dede is proprelich 
in pe subget and nougt in pe obiect. 
And gif pe acte and dede 
is in eny wise 
in þe obiect git he is more in pe subiecte 
p a n pe obiect. 
Panne this loutyng and reuerens 
is more in hym 
p a t louteth and d o p pe reuerens 
in pe whoche he is as in pe subiect, 
p a n in hym to wham pe reuerens is idoun whan a is as in pe obiect. 
Panne it is wel iseide 
p a t reuerens and worschipe 
is more in hym þat doth reuerens and worschepe p a n in hym þat is iworschepped. 
Panne, 
for felicite is most in hym p 
a t is felix and ioyful, 
felicite schal nougt be iset in worschepe. 
Panne it is vnsemeliche to eueriche man 
to set his felicite in worschippe and trowe p a t a ys felix 
and in fol ioye 
and welthe gif a ys iworschepped of al men, 
and p a t is most vnsemelich to a kyng. 
And p a t we may declare by p r e weyes, 
for gif a kyng setteþ his felicite in worschep 
hym folweth þre harmes; 
for þanne a semeth goode 
and is nougt good, 
and is presumptuouse and vnrigthful. 
For gif a prince settep his felicite in worscheppe, 
and it suffiseth to J 
a man p a t scholde be iworschepped 
þat a seme goode, 
þanne suche reccheth nougt to be good in dede. 
Perfore [in] Politicfis] 
þe philosofer seith þat thei 
that telleth so grete pris of worschippe bien faitours 
and semeth gode 
and ben nougt gode in dede. 
Panne it is moste semelich to a kyng r to be goode in dede. 
Panne it is most vnsemelich to hym 
to sette his félicitée in worschippe, 
lest he be a faitour, 
semyng goode and nougt goode in dede. 
Pe secunde, 
it is vnsemelyche to a kyng 
to sette his felicite in wor schippe, 
for þerby he schold brynge þe puple in grete peril, 
for while pe ende is most desired 
and iloued gif a prince settep his felicite in worschepe, 
for to haue | worscheppe 
he wol putte his men 
and poeple col. 
to al maner peril. Here of we hauen ensample of pe sone 
of a certeyn prince of Rome 
that het Torquatus. 
Pis sone desired moche worschippe 
and putte hym in peril in bataille 
agenst his fader heste. 
And for oþer scholde nougt take ensample 
p e r b y 
and desire moche worscheppe, 
this Torquatus prince of Rome 
sloug his owne sone 
p a t was so coueitous and presumptuouse, 
nougt withstonding 
þat his sone hadde þe victorie 
and maystrie of his enemye. 
Pat a prince be nougt hed strong, 
nother to hasti, 
noþer presumptuouse, 
it is nougt spedeful 
to a kyng to sette his felicite in worschippe. 
Pe þridde, 
p a t is vnsemelich 
to a kyng for a schold nougt be vnrigtful. 
For it is semelich to a prince 
to dele his goode 
as persones ben worthi, 
so p a t a geue more gode 
to wise men worthi þan to vnworthi men and mynystrals. 
Bote gif a prince setteth his felicite in worschepe 
for pe ende is moste iloued, 
a reccheth nougt to rewarde persones 
as p e i bien worthi, 
bote he wol dele his good onliche in soche a maner 
as he may gete moste worschippe. 
Panne gif a kyng setteth his felicite in worschippe 
a schal be euel in hymself, 
for a rechcheth nougt bote 
to be iholde goode; 
and a schal be euel to pe puple 
þat is vnder hym, 
for a spareth nougt to putte ham presumptuousliche 
and hastelich to peril; 
and schal be euel 
in his owne good, 
for a deleth [nougt] his good 
to persones as bien worthi. Chapter IX Fama, 
þat is loos, 
and gloria bien oþer p 
a n worschippe and preysyng. 
For worschippe and preysyng bien cause of fama and of gloria. 
A man is in fama and in gloria, 
for a is ipreised and iworschepped, 
and worschep is o p 
e r þan preysyng, 
for worschepe is more general and comyn þan preysyng; 
for properliche preysyng 
is nougt bote by spekyng, 
bote I worschippe 
is by al other outward signes. 
And so it is iseide, 
f. primo Rethoricorum, 
p a t parties of worschep bien sacrefice, knelyng, and loutyng, 
and settyng tofore in metre 
and in bedes biddyng, 
and suche outward signes 
p a t perteyneth to reuerens and worschippe. 
And gloria and fama bien ofte itake al one and pe same, 
for gloria is a certeyn clere knowleche 
for a certeyn man. 
For gloria is a certeyne ciernes, 
and þis same is fame, 
for fame is a certeyn clere knowleche with preysing. 
Bote gif we wolle in eny wise distingue bitwene gloria and fama, 
we V Part I schold say pat fama cometh of gloria. 
Panne is pe o[rdre] pat gloria cometh of worschepe, 
and in grete array he semeth clere and gloriouse. 
And fame cometh of worschep and of gloria. 
For if a man is in worschippe and in gloria, 
garnie a ys in fame and in reputacioun. 
For to take gloria and fama largeliche in þat wise and for al is in one and pe same. 
Panne for man myt wene pat felicite scholde be iset in fame and gloria, 
for that fcerby his name 
may be wide isprad 
and in to diuers londes and dure longe tyme. 
Also it semeth þat a prince scholde gerinne sette his felicite; 
for, v Ethicorum, 
Ipe philosofer seith pat pe meyde 
þat schal be ieue 
to princes is worschep and gloria. 
And if pei beth not apaied þerwith, 
thanne pei bien tiraunt. 
Bote þÍS may nout stonde, 
and pat we may declare by p r e weyes. 
For as it perteyneth to this worke, 
and as it is iseide tofore honde atte folie, 
felicite is nout 
onlich signe of goode bote 
it is also parfite gode 
and suffisaunt by hitself. 
Pe seconde, felicite is onliche in gode men 
and ioyful and nout in euel men and schrewednes. 
Pe þridde, 
it is in inward goode 
and nout in outward goode. 
And fame is aeward, 
for fame is signe of goodnes more þan it is 
gode|nes and perteyneth nout onlich to gode men 
bote to meny euel col. men. ‡Also fama is more in outward signes garnie in pe inner goodnes. 
A man hath fame among men 
for he is clerlich and worthilich iknowe among men. 
And for [oulre sciens 
and knowyng is nout pe pynges pat we knoweth, 
nother cause p e r o i , 
bote it is signe of pe thinges 
ben cause þerof, 
þanne fame is nout [ou]re godenes, 
noþer [ou]re goodnes dependeth þerof: 
bote fame is onlich 
an outward signe of [oulre goodnes. 
Panne [oulre felicite is nout in fame. 
Pe secunde, 
þat it may nout stonde, 
for nout onlich gode men haueth gloria and fame among hem bote also euel men and schrewes. 
For ofte we beth bygeled in demyng 
þat horrible peruersite and errour happeth ofte tyme, 
pat good men and worþy beth nout itold of, 
and euel and schrewes beth in fame and gloria. 
Pe thridde, 
pat felicite is nout in fame, 
for fame stondeth more in outward signes 
þan inward goodnes, 
for man seeth nout bote outward þynges; 
for we seeth nout pe þousttes of herte, 
nother vertues ne malis of þout and of herte. 
Bote if we demeth a man vertuouse and goode, 
þat is by outward signes 
þat we seeth and knoweth; 
for a man to be iworschepped, 
it suffiseth þat a seme goode outward. 
So for a man to be in gloria and fame among men, 
hit suffiseth as it semeth pat a seme a goode man outward. 
Perfore for it is semelich 
þat a kyng be al good, 
as it were an half god, 
and it is inconuenient 
to sette felicite in þing pat is signe of goodnes ‡ more 
þan it is godnesse, 
in þyng in pe which euel men 
and schrewes beth, 
and stondeth more in outward thinges fcan in inward godenes: 
þanne it is inconuenient 
to a kyng to tro we 
þat he is in felicite, 
þeig he be | famous and gloriouse among men and puple. 
Panne f. a kyng schal nougt trowe 
that he is in félicitée and goode, 
theigh he be in gloria among men and puple. 
Bote a is blisfol gif 
a is gloriouse anon to God. 
It is iseide 
p a t gloria and fama 
is a certeyne clere knowynge with preysyng. 
As longeth herto, 
in p r e wise [ou]re knowyng 
and Goddes knowyng ‡bien diuers: 
for Goddes knowyng is cause of thinges, 
and thinges bien [‡] cause of [ ‡ oure] knowyng, 
as pe comentour seithe, 
xii Metaphisice. 
Also Goddis knowyng is infallible, 
and [oulre knowyng fayleþ ofte tyme. 
Also Goddys knowyng 
is of inward kynges, 
and [ou]re knowyng strecheþ 
by hymself 
and forþ rigt only to outward þynges. 
Panne [ou]re goodnes and knowyng is dependaunt of Goddes knowyng 
as pe effecte is dependaunt of his cause. 
Aboute oure goodnes, 
Goddes knowyng failleth nougt, 
fore his knowyng may nougt faille. 
Also God seith oure inward godnes and malis. 
Panne it may nougt be þat God accounteth a man in gloria and in fame 
oþer in clere knowyng with preysyng, 
bote p a t man be gode 
and in wel the as his state axeth. 
Peig it be so of knowyng ‡of God 
and of his accountyng of gloria and fame, 
git is nougt felicite in gloria and fame 
p a t is among men. 
And for it is iseide 
p a t fama 
p a t is among men dureth long and springeth wide, 
þe contrary mygt be iseide, 
p a t it is schort duryng 
and springeth bote in litel place, 
for Bois seith p a t pe fame of pe Romayns passede neuer pe hulle, 
Mont [Cauclasum. 
Panne how schulde Ipe fame 
of one man springe in to alle pe worlde wide? 
Bote for in comparisoun to heuene, 
al pe erpe is as it were a poynt, 
and astronomers telleth 
that the leste notabel sterre 
þat [is] isee in heuene is more þanne al pe | erthe, 
þanne col. mannis fame 
spredeth bote litel 
and is in litel place. 
Al soche fame is schort and dureth bote a while, 
for al pe tyme of þis lyf 
is as it were a poynt 
in comparisoun to pe lif p a t euere schal leste. 
For the resounhabele saule deyeth nougt, 
felicite schal be iset gerinne, 
for felicite schal be iset in thing 
p a t may dure for euermore. 
It was iseide 
p a t kynges scholde haue to here mede gloria and worschep; 
bote pe philosofer his text 
is nougt vnderstonde in þis wise, 
p a l kynges scholde axe principallich 
for here mede and fame among men, 
fore þanne here fruyte were lite. 
Bot p a t is iseid 
for it is semelich 
þat kynges and prynses ben men 
of grete dedes and cost. 
And theigh men of grete cost haue nougt here entent principallich in worschippe 
bote in goode and in catel, 
git me doth ham worschepe; 
and it is semeliche 
p a t pey alowe pe worschipe 
þat is ido to ham, 
whanne men haueþ none gretter myude to quyte ham, 
as it is iseide, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
nougt þat worschep is ful mede 
and quytyng to ham, 
as it is par iseide. 
Bote fongyng and alowyng of worschipe 
as for folle quityng 
and mede may be vnderstonde in twey wise, 
o p e r 
by cause of worschip in itself, 
o p e r by cause of pe affeccioun of pe men 
þat d o p pe worschep. 
Worschep r Part I in itself 
is nout bote signe and witnes of goodnes, 
as it is ischowed; 
and so worschipe is nout ful quytyng and mede. 
Bote by cause of affeccioun of ham 
þat dop pe worschepe, 
it is a manere couenable quytyng. 
For while p e i p a t dop pe worschipe 
haueþ none gretter mede to quyte, 
it is semelich p a t a prince allowe pe worschippe 
p a t is ido in p a t wise. Perfore as it is pleynlich iknowe in soche quytyng, 
pe affeccioun of ham 
p a t doþ | 
þe worschipe is allowed, 
f. nout propreliche pe worschep is allowed. 
Bote if princes aloweth nout þe affeccioun of men 
p a t doþ ham moche worschepe, 
bote chalengeth and axeth of men 
þat ben vnder ham other outward gode and catel, 
as gold and siluer and other riches, 
Jeanne þei bien tirauntes, 
for if Jei doun so thei despoilen pe poeple. V Chapter X 
In libro De Re Militari it semeth p a t Vegesius preyseth wit and sligh craft of batails 
ouer al kynges, 
for as he seith principallich 
þat brout vp pe Romayns for pey aue hymself most to bataills 
and to dedes of armes, 
and studiede with al here myt 
how and in what wise pey myte make sogette to ham nacioun and poeple. 
Parfore he seeth a prince 
his principale intent 
schold be to haue grete cyuyle myt and strengthe, 
and ^erby to make men 
and naciouns sogette to hym. 
if it were so, 
it wolde seme J^at a kyng scholde sette his felicite 
in cyuyle myt and strengte. 
And þat is fais, for, vii Poleticorum, 
the philosofer preueth by fyue resons 
p a t felicite schal nout be iset in ciuile mit and strengthe. 
Pe furste way is itake 
for suche a principate dureth nout fui longe tyme; 
þe secounde, 
for non verrey prince is withoute godenes of lif; 
pe t^ridde, 
for he is [vnlworthi; 
pe ferde, 
for by soche a principate men ben iordeyned 
to lasse gode and profite; 
pe fifte, 
for comonliche soche lordschipe is greuous and noyfol. 
Pe furste wey is declared in this wise, 
for he p a t wol make men and naciouns söget to hym by cyuyl myt and strengthe wol be prince 
and lord by violens, 
and violens is nout perpetual, 
and violent thinges duret nout longe. 
Soche principate may nout longe dure. 
Bote as pe fure is by kynde hote | 
and worcheth kyndelich 
whanne it heteth, 
so col. whanne a man 
is set kyndelich in fre wille, 
þanne he hath kynde lord schip of men, 
whanne he is prince ouer hym frelich 
and by gode wille. 
And þat is whanne pe poeple doþ 
pe prince his hestes frelich 
and with gode wille. 
Panne a kyng schal nout tro we þat he is in weljse 
and in felicite 
if he is a lord 
by violens and by cyuyle myt and strengthe. 
For soche lordschipe is violent and aens kynde 
and may nout longe dure. 
Felicite schal nout be iset infcyngp a t passeth, 
bote in thing 
þat lestep euermore. 
Pe secounde, felicite schal nougt be iset in cyuyle mygt and strengthe, 
for p a t may be ihad withoute goodnes of lyf. 
As it is iseide tofore, 
felicite is parfite gode 
and suffisaunt by itself. 
Hit is inpossible p a t Je beste gode is in eny man bote a lyue wel and be fol gode, 
as it is inpossible 
þat grete whitenes be in a body 
bote þat body be fol white. 
And p a t cyuyle myt and strengthe myt 
be had withoute godenes of lyf, 
it may be preued by thinges 
þat we hauen iseie in olde tyme. 
For we hauen iseye many ful euel tyrauntes 
haue grete cyuyle myt and strengthe. 
For Denys Siracusanus oþer Denys Felicianus 
hadde most cyuyle myt and strengthe, 
as p e philosofer seith [in] Politic[is], 
and was p e worste tiraunt alyue. 
Also Nero and Cesar, princes of Rome, had gret cyuyle myt and strengte and lyuede atte worste, 
for þey were so lecherous 
p a t thei semed wommen 
at alle and were so cruel 
þat no mercy noþer pitee was isey in ham, 
and so, vii Poleticorum, 
p e philosofer seith 
þat it is a scorne to tro we pat eny man is felix 
and in welthe gif a leueth nout wel. 
Pan felicite is nout 
in ciuil myt and strengte 
þat may be ihadde withoute godenes | of leuyng. 
f. io Pe þridde, 
félicitée is nout 
in suche myt and strengthe, 
for soche principate is nout best nother worthi, 
for gif felicite schal be iset in eny principate, 
it schal be iset in p 
e best principate and worthi; 
and he þat by cyuel myt 
and strengte is prince, 
[is prince] of bonde men 
and pralle and nout of fre men, 
and soche a principate 
is by strengte 
and by streynyng and by violens. 
And principatus bien ilikned in comparisoun 
by ham of p 
e whoche a man is prince, 
and as p e philosofer wol [in] Poletictis], 
in as moche as fre men bien better p 
a n bonde men and pralle, 
in so moche it is bettre and more worthi 
to be prince of fre men 
þan of bonde men and pralle. 
Panne principate j^at is by violens and ciuyle myt and strengte is nout best principate no^er worJDy, 
fore it is a principate of bonde men and pralle. 
Perfore, vii Politicorum, 
it is iseide JDat principate of fre men, 
pat is with vertue, 
is bettre p a n principate of bonde men and pralle, 
pat is by violens and þraldome. 
Pe ferde, felicite is nout in cyuyle myt and strengte, 
for if a prince troweth pat a is felix 
and in welthe if a hath grete ceuyle myt and strengthe, 
a wol noutordeyne p e citeseyns bote to dedes of armes 
and to make naciouns söget to hym. 
He schal nout Jeanne brynge p e citeseyns 
to vertue of rightwisenesse bote p e vertues of stalwardnes and of strengte; 
and as p e philosofer seith, 
vii Politicorum, rithwisnes, iusticia, 
is better Joanne strengþe. 
Pan he ordeyneth nout p e citeseyns to p e more gode, 
p a t is iusticia, 
bote onlich p e lasse gode, 
J^at is fortitudo, stalwardnes. 
Panne laste pe comyn profite persche, 
JDat is more godelich p a n eny synguler profite, 
it semeth nout a prince 
to sette his felicite 
in cyuyl myt and strengte. 
Pe fifte, 
p a t semeth hym nout, 
for soche principate is greuose, 
for [félicitée] is p e ende" 
‡of al workes | and dedes. 
Eueriche man col. r Parti ordeineth 
al his lif 
and his workes and dedes 
to p a t þyng in p 
e whoche a setteth his félicitée. 
Panne he jsat setteth his felicite 
in cyuyle myt and strengte 
and maketh naciouns söget to hym, 
he schal on case bere hym wel in werre tyme. Bote he can nougt lyue wel in tyme of pese, 
for as it fareth of soche a prince, 
for p e more dele a studieth 
aboute dedes of armes and ordeyneth 
al his lif to stalwardnes 
and nout to iusticia and temporancia, 
and kan nout perfore leue in tyme of pese, 
in p e whoche tyme nedeþ iusticia and temporancia, 
bote he schal be viciouse 
and falle in to damage of saule. 
Perfore p e philosofer, 
vii Polit icorum, 
despiseth p e Lacedemones, 
þat setteth here felicite in cyuyle myst and strengte, 
and seith þat is foule 
to be partiners of gode in tyme of werre and vicious in tyme of pese. 
Perfore if it is inconuenient 
to sette félicitée in fcyng 
þat dureth nout longe 
and in thing 
pat may be withoute goodnes of leuyng, 
and is vnworthi, 
by p e whoche men beth iordeyned 
to p e lasse gode and profite, 
and greueth ofte tyme; 
and for p e more dele 
it is inconuenient to a prince 
to sette his felicite in cyuyle myt and strengte and to trowe 
pat he is in félicitée gif 
a may make nacions sochet to hymme. Chapter XI 
By thynges p a t bien iseide 
it is clere inough 
þat felicite schal nout be iset in bodilich gode, 
bote as it semeth p r e maner bodilich gode men desireth moste: hele, feyrnes and strengte, 
and meny setteth hire felicite 
in soche gode of p e body. 
Bote it semeth contrari to gode of Je body 
and gode of p e saule; 
for p e lasse is ihad of gode of þe body, 
p e more it is desired; 
for ar soche gode be ihad, 
it is iholde beter þan it is. 
And whanne soche gode is ihad it semeth nougt so | gode as it is f. iholde. 
Bote it is aeward of gode of p e saule, 
for whanne it is ihad 
it is ifounde better þanne it was iholde. 
Perfore som p a t knoweth nougt p 
e swetnes of wit 
and of wisdom 
blameth ham 
þat Studien and bien ioccupied in philosophi and in sciens, 
for a knoweth nougt p e goodnes and swetnes þerof; 
[for gif a knoweth p e goodnes and swetnes þerof] 
he wolde nougt onlich blame ham 
þat eueth ham to worldelich riches, 
bote he wolde also scorny al p a t p a t eueth ham nout to vertues and to sciens. 
For bodilich gode, 
ar it be ihad, 
semeth beter 
p a n it is. 
Meny þat lakkeJD bodilich gode desireth it hogelich and troweth 
þat it [is] so excellent Jat gifþei hadde soche gode a wolde wene 
p a t a were in welthe 
and in félicitée. 
Parfore, primo Ethicorum, 
it is iseide 
p a t sike men setteth here felicite 
in hele and beggers in riches and fowle men 
in feyrnes 
and feble men in strengte. 
Bote p a t felicite is nougt in strengte, 
nother in feyrnes, noþer in hele, 
we may declare by p r e weyes. 
Pe furste, 
for soche gode is bodilich goode; 
p e seconde, 
for soche gode is som dele outward goode; 
p e v p r i d d e , 
for soche gode is varryable and chaungeth sone. 
Soche gode is bodilich gode 
for it is igrounded in þe body, 
for hele is in þe humoris 
and feyrnes in p e membres, 
and strengthe in bones and synewes. 
For as p e philosofer meneth, 
iii De Elegendis, 
hele is thiwe euenes [of] humours, 
and feyrnes is þeiwe proporcioun of membres, 
and strengthe is thuwe proporcioun of bones and of synwes; 
and so for humors, membres, synwes and bones bien bodilich hele, 
feyrnes and strengte bien bodilich kynges. 
Panne felicite schal nout be iset gerinne. 
Pe secunde, felicite schal not be iset in soche gode, 
fore it is som dele outward gode, 
for as p e philosofer seith, 
man is more verrailiche p e inwyt p a n p e outter felyng, 
and þe saule hath more | 
of þe resoun of col. man 
p a n p e body, 
and al[wey] p e fourme hath more verrey kynde of a fcyng p a n n e p e mater. 
Panne p e gode of p e saule 
is oure best inward gode. 
Panne felicite schal nougt be iset in hele, feyrnes, 
nother in strengte of body, 
bote in hele, feyrnes, 
and strengthe of saule. 
Panne a man ne schal nout trowe 
pat he is in felicite and in welthe, 
fceigh he haue temporate humors 
and hele of body, 
nother p e i g pey hauen semelich membres and lemes, 
and be feire and semelich, 
n þ e r Jei he haue proporciónate bones 
and synwes and be strong of body. 
Botefoif] his vertues ben euene 
and p e neper vertues söget to resoun, 
and gif he is hole 
and strong in soule, 
and [gif] soche vertues bien ihigt 
with gode thewes and maner 
and with gode workes and dede, 
so p a t he is feyre in sawle, 
garnie as his state axeth 
he schal trowe 
that he is felix and in welthe. 
And we seyn, 
as his astate axeth, 
for in this lif may nout be fol felicite. 
Hele, fayrnes and strengthe ben outward good; 
perfore felicite schal nout be iset gerinne. 
And p a t félicitée is onlich inward gode proprelich p e philosofer witnesseth, 
vii Poleticorum, 
and seith God 
is oure witnes p a t felicite schal be iset [in] inward gode, 
for God witnesseth p a t by hymself, 
as he seith. 
Therefor God is nout blisful by outward gode, 
bote by gode 
þat is in hymself. 
Panne gif p e blisful saule 
is ilikned to God, 
he is nout [blisful] bote by god 
þat is in p e same saule. 
Pe þridde, félicitée schal nougt [be] iset in suche goode, 
for it is ful variable and vnstedefaste; 
for euenesse of humors is vnder p e meuyng of p 
e sterres and pianettes and varieth sone, 
and chaungeth by chaungyng of p 
e eire and of mete and drynke. 
Bote gif hele failleth, 
þanne failleth bodyly strengte, 
for þanne p e membres slaketh 
and p e senewes bien feble, 
and þerby proporcioun | of bones fayleth and of synewys, 
f. *io in p 
e whiche is p 
e myt and p e strengte of body. 
Also in p e same wise, 
gif hele failleth, 
fayrnesse failleth. 
For garnie pe membris bien lewed, 
and colour þerof passeth in p e proporcioun in p e whiche is fairenesse ikept and isaued. 
Panne it is not semelich 
to a kyng noþer anoþer man 
to sette his felicite 
in suche goode, 
for it is bodilich 
and som del outward good and chaungeth sone. 
r Part I Panne to p e menyng of al pat is iseide, 
it semeth nougt a prince 
to sette his félicitée 
in voluptuous and bodilich likyng, 
nother in riches, 
nother in worschepe, 
nother in fame, 
nother in cyuyle myt and strengte, 
noþer in hele, 
noþer in strengte, 
noþer in fayrenes of body. 
But al pes thinges he schal vse p a t he may fcerby come to felicite. 
He schal vse mete and drynke in p 
e whiche his body [hath] likyng 
for conseruacioun and sauyng 
of his owne lif and of his persone; 
for by cause p 
a t he is heed of þe regne, 
of lacke of hym myt come 
moche harme in to p e comyntee. 
And he schal vse p 
e dede of wedlok 
for getyng of children, 
for by cause of defaute of children 
and of heyres many rewmes bien deuyded and destroyed. 
For whanne princes deieth withoute children 
many ariseth for to be lordes and makeþ dessencioun among p e poeple. 
Also a prince schal haue suffisaunt richesse 
p a t he may deffende p e regne 
and vse dedes of vertues. 
Also it semeth a kyng to be magnificus, 
p a t he may avaunce worthi persones; 
and p a t may not be withoute richesse. 
For to telle prise of p e kyng, 
þe kyng most haue worschep. 
And it is worschepful, spedful, 
p a t he haue cyuyle myt and strengte, 
for ofte me telleth litel of þe prince 
that hath litel power of ciuil strengte, 
and for defaute þerof many d o p euel and greuen o p e r men and p a t is harm to p e regne. 
Also a prince schal telle price of good fame, 
for þerby p e sogettes bien | ibrout to vertue, 
for col. ofte soche as |e prince is, 
suche is p e puple; 
for whanne p e prince is good, 
p e sugettes taken 
for to do wel. 
Also hele, feirness and strengte semeth a prince, 
not for gerinne is proporliche felicite, 
bote for þerby a cometh to felicite. 
Panne suche good schal be iloued in Jat he helpeth to félicitée 
and to somme of clernesse of felicite. 
Perfore here of how he schal be iloued 
we passeth schortliche; 
for here of inneremore we schal som what trete. Chapter XII 
Twey félicitées 
p e philosofer setteth. 
Pe oon is politik and p e o p e r is contemplatif. 
He wol not sette felicite 
in strengte [ ‡ oper in] m y s t and vertues of p e soule, 
for gerinne b þ e gode and euel bien conteyned; 
nother in habitis of p e saule, 
for they p a t haueth habit and wercheth nout is likned to a slepyng man. 
While men slepeth, semeth no diuersite 
bytwene hem [pat bien wrecched] 
and men p a t bien in felicite, 
as p e philosofer m e n e p primo Ethicorum. 
Pan felicite schal be set in dede and worchyng of p e soule 
and not in worchyng of a vice, 
bote in worching of a vertue 
and nout of eueriche vertue 
bote a parfite vertue. 
Panne as it is iseid, primo Ethicorum, 
felicite is worchyng of þe soule by parfite vertue. 
And p e philosofer moeneth 
p a t in pollitik lif p e parfit vertue is prudencia, redynesse; 
and in contemplatif lif 
p e parfit vertue is sapiencia, wisdom, other methaphysica. 
And he ‡meneth 
p a t eueriche man 
þat can redilich rewle wel oþer men, 
he is politik felix; 
and he p a t can goode skyle 
in speculacioun 
by methaphysica 
is contemplatif felix. 
Of these twey félicitées 
he makeþ mencioun 
and treteth of politik felicite, primo Ethicorum, 
and of contemplatif felicite in x. 
And whether it be oon posicioun 
of þe philosofer or [not], 
it longeth not to pis tretes; 
while it may be iknowe how a kyng schal | sette his f. 
*io felicite in dedes of redynes, 
it is to wetyng 
p a t it is most semelich 
to a kyng 
to sette his felicite in God hymself. 
And þat we may declare [by þre weyes], 
for a kyng is a man, 
and Godes seruant, 
and rulere of many other. 
In þat he is man 
he hath inwyt and reson; 
and pe good of resoun 
is nougt a singuler good, 
for þat is sencible good. 
Bote pe goode of resoun 
is vniuersal good and intellectuale. 
Panne for a kyng is a man and hath resoun, 
it is semelich 
p a t he sette his félicitée in good 
þat is most vniuersal and most intellectuale; 
and p a t is God hymself, 
p a t is good of al goode, 
for in hym is al goode; 
and is also most vniuersale good and most intellectuale, 
for he is most symple 
and most out of matier. 
Pe secounde, 
it semeth a prince 
to sette his felicite in God hymself, 
not oonlich for he is man, 
but also for he is Goddes seruaunt 
in a spe cial manere. 
For thing p a t hath part in a þing and vnparfitlich 
is his lyme and his instrument 
þat hath p 
a t þyng essencialliche and parfitliche. 
Panne for God hath onlich principallich and parfitlich vertue and myght to gouerne and to regne, 
but eueriche oþer prince and kyng [i]s Godes instrument and seruant; 
and a seruaunt schal sette his reward 
and myude in his lord, 
and byde to fonge it of hym; 
Jeanne it semeth a kyng 
þat is Goodes seruaunt 
to sette his felicitée in God hymself and abide pe rewarde of hym. 
Pe þridde, 
p a t semeth a kyng for he is rule[r] of meny, 
for he p a t ruleth many schal 
haue his entent 
in pe comyn profitg. 
Panne he schal sette his felicite in thing 
p a t is most good and profitable and comyn good, 
and as it is iseid, 
þat is God hymself. 
Panne for a kyng is Goddys seruaunt 
and for he hath intellectus and inwit, 
and also for a taketh | col. heede to þe comyn profite, 
he schal sette his felicite in God 
pe whiche he serueth 
and is most intellectuale good 
and most profitable and comune. 
Panne gif pe kyng schal sette his félicitée in God, 
he mote sette suche felicite 
in doyng of p 
a t vertue by pe 
whiche we bep most iuned to God, 
and p a t is pe doyng of loue and of charitee, 
for loue o n e p and iuneth most. 
And so, iiii De Diuinis Nominibus, 
Denys seith p a t loue, 
wheþer it be of kynde, 
o p e r of beste, 
o p e r of man, 
oþer of angel, 
oþer of God, 
it is a vertue of onynge. 
Panne in Goddes loue schal ‡felicite be iset. 
Bote for pe assay þerof is work in dede 
and it is iknowe 
þat on loueth 
an nother gif he dop 
w h a t h e wol haue ido, 
þanne gif a prince 
is v Part I felix and louyng God he schal trowe 
p a t he is felix in doyng 
þat God wol haue ido. 
And of kynges and princes God axeth and chalangeth most p 
a t thei rule 
p e puple 
þat is vnder hem rigtfulliche and holyliche 
by redynesse of lawe. 
Panne kynges and princes schal sette here felicite 
in dede of redinesse, 
and nougt sympleliche, 
bote as charité commaundeth and hoteþ. 
Perfore in dede of charite felicite schal more be isette p a n in dede of redinesse, 
for we bep nerer ionid to God 
bi charité þanne by redinesse, 
peis felicite schal be isette sum del 
in dede of redinesse 
in p e maner p a t is iseide. Chapter XIII 
A kynges mede is greet 
and his félicitée is greet gif he ruleth his poeple rightfulliche 
by redynesse and by lawe, 
and p a t we may declare by fyue. 
For as it longeth to pis work it semeth p a t p e kynges myude toucheth and longeth to fyue: 
to God þat geueth it, 
to p e kyng p 
a t fongeth it, 
to p e dede of p 
e whiche it cometh, 
[to] p e vertue by p 
e whiche it is ido, 
and to p e mater in p 
e whiche it is ido. 
For God rewardeth and quyteth al good 
and for he | rewardeth nogt bot for loue, 
and for alwey f. loue 
is to liknes and acoord, 
it nedeth be lyche and accordynge to God, 
who p a t desireth to be rewarded of God. 
Panne p e more a man bereth þe ymage and p e more he is accordyng, 
p e more mede he schal haue of God. 
A princes state wol p a t he be more p 
a n his sogettis accordyng to God. 
And gif a kyng studieth 
to rule his regne 
by redynesse 
and by lawe as God ruleth 
and gouerneth al p e worlde, 
þanne p e kyng 
is most accordyng to God. 
Panne touchyng God, 
p a t geueth p e mede, 
þe kynges mede is greet gif he ruleth his regne aright, 
for in p a t he is moost accordyng to God. 
Pe seconde, p e kynges mede is grete touchinge hymself p a t fongeth p e mede. 
For alle dedes taketh a maner goodnesse of difficulté of worchynge, 
he p a t may mysdo and mysdoj) 
not beth þe bettre. 
For manye p a t may not do harme 
kepeth hemself fro harme; 
but gif he were take 
to state of dignité 
he wolde do moche harme. 
Perfore, [v] Ethicorum, 
it is iwrete þat principate scheweth what a man is, 
for þan a man scheweth p a t [a] schal fonge whan he is prince 
and may doo good and harme, 
and is þanne iknowe 
and thenketh what he is. 
Panne in comparisoun p e kynge þat schal fonge mede is grete. 
For kynges p a t bien occupide 
in p e comyn profit 
and may do iuel and d o p non bien worthi p e more mede. 
And we seyen pat in þe commyn profite, 
for but he be occupide 
in p e comyn profite, 
it nedej) not þat he be worthi þe more mede 
þeig a may trespace. 
For gif a man putteþ hem to peril and takej) non hede of p 
e comune profite, 
þeig a trespace nougt, 
for he d o p vnwiseliche his mede 
is neuer þe more. 
r Pe þridde, 
mede of princes is grete touchinge 
p e dede by | p 
e whoche col. 
he wynneth suche mede. 
For a dede is vicious gif 
it is agenst kynde 
and agenst p 
e ordre of resoun; 
and is good and vertuous gif 
it is by kynde, 
and þe more it is 
by ordre of resoun, 
þe bettre it is 
and þe more medful. 
It is ful kyndelich 
that a party potte itself to saue þe hole. 
For we seeth gif p e heed 
is in peril 
al p e body is in peril; 
and for p e arm is a partie of p e bodye he putteth al itself iorp for p e heed, 
lest al p e body be ipersched. 
Panne gif kynges ruleþ wel p e puple p 
a t is vnder hem, 
þanne by here workes p 
e i schulle come to p 
e grete mede for p 
e i putten hem hooliche forth for p 
e comun profitg 
and for p e hool profite. Pe ferthe, 
p e mede of kynges 
is greet by cause of p e vertue 
by the whiche þei wynnen here mede, 
for lasse vertue nedeþ 
a man to rule hymself 
than to rule many, 
and lasse to rule manye p a n to rule a cite or a regne. 
Panne p e vertue of p e kyng moot be greet 
þat moot rule 
not onlich hymself, 
noþer onlich his meynye, 
but also al p e regne. 
And for a gret vertue 
is worthi greet mede, 
grete is p e mede of kynges 
þat ruleth here règnes aright. Pe fifte, greete is mede of kynges touchyng p e matire in p 
e whoche pe[i] worcheþ, 
for a man is preysed 
gif he ruleth aright o synguler per sone, 
and p e comun profit is more goodlich 
p a n eny singuler profit. 
Panne p e matiere in p 
e whiche p e kyng is occupide, 
p a t is God and multitude, 
demeth þat his meede is greet. Part II

After þat by help of God 
we hauen iended pe furste partie of þis firste 
n the whiche it is itreted of mannis owne gouernaunce, 
schewynge wherinne kynges and princes schullen sette here felicite. For it is not semelich 
for hem to sette here ende in riches 
noþer in cyuil myst and strengþe, 
noþer in no suche thinges; 
but he schal vse al suche thinges, 
as it is proued tofore atte folle, 
as instrumentis and inuen[c]iones 
for to come to felicitée. 
Þei schullen sette here felicite 
in dede of prudencia, 
as p a t dede cometh of charité. 
For þanne kynges hauen felicite accordyng to here astate, 
whanne by excityng of [d]eleccioun of God, 
þey rulen hem p a t bien vnder hem holilyche and rightfulliche 
by prudencia of regnynge 
and by lawe of resoun. 
Panne pe felicite of kynges schal be principalliche iset in God. 
And by knowyng and loue of hym he schal ordeyne here studie and here lif þerto, 
þat p e i mowe knowe and loue God and rule pe poeple p a t is vnder ham 
as verrey Goddes seruauntes 
by ordre of resoun. Panne, 
for pis is treted, 
and it is schewed 
where inne kynges schal sette here ende and felicite by pe ordre 
p a t is isette, 
now it is to schewyng 
in what vertues kynges schal be excellent and vertuous 
by certeyn heygtyng and perfeccioun of pe soule. 
Perfore it nedeth firste to schewe whiche bien 
pe vertual 
poten|cie and mytes 
of pe soule and in col. 
whiche mystes pe vertues bien igrounded and ipit. 
And þanne it schal be ischewed 
how pe vertues bien distingued. 
Perafter we schal declare how many suche vertues per bien 
and whiche þ e r o f is principale, 
and whiche is secundary, 
andþeannewe schal trete singulerlich of eueriche of pese vertues 
and how it semeth kynges and princes 
to haue suche vertues. 
Pe vertual mygtes of pe soule mowe be destyngued in pese wise: 
for som bien kynde and natural, 
and some cognitif and sensitif, 
and some appetitif, 
and some intellectual. 
In natural myites of pe soule we communeth 
with herbes and treen, 
as in vertual myst of norsching, of wexinge, 
and of gendrynge, 
and in suche as corden to herbes and treen. 
Pe mystes of sensitif knowyng and felyng be pe sit, tast, and touche, 
and p e oþer wittes, 
and þerinne we accordeþ wiþ oþser bestes. 
Pe appetitif is destyngued, 
for oon appétit 
is in man and not in o p 
e r bestes as p e appétit p 
a t foloweth p e intellectual inwit. 
And anofcer maner appétit 
is in man and in beste, 
as p e appetite p 
a t folweth p e felyng, 
and suche appetite may be cleped sensualitas. 
And p e appétit þat folweth p 
e intellectual inwit 
is icleped voluntas, 
p e wille. 
And in p a t manere of speche 
o p e r bestes hauende appetite 
pat hatte sensualitas 
and appetitus sensitiuus, 
and haueth not p 
e appetite pat hatte voluntas, 
þe intellectual wille. 
Panne p e vertues of p 
e whiche we thinketh 
to speke bien goode habites, 
p a t is dwellyng places; <outhir thai> bien in p 
e natural vertual mygtes, 
oþer in p e vertual mystes and wittes of felyng, 
oþer in p e appetite sensitif of felyng, 
oþer in | p e appetite intellectual, 
o p e r in p e f. intellecte and inwyt, 
o p e r in al pes, 
o p e r in some þerof. 
And a mowe not be in natural vertual migttes 
and jsat is declared in p r e wise. [Firste,] 
for we bep nougt preysed noþer iblamed 
for naturel and kynde vertue, 
for no man is acounted a good man for he hath good degestioun and wexinge. 
Pe seconde, suche vertues bep nougt in p 
e naturel vertual mytes, 
for suche vertues stonden by resoun 
as it may be preued, 
ii Ethicorum, 
and natural mytes 
bien not obedient to resoun 
in þat þei bien soche. 
For p e i a man make resouns 
wheþer he wil o p e r no, 
properliche for to speke p e natural potencial vertues varieth not in here 
kynde worchynge 
but wercheth alwey 
with al here myt. 
Pe þridde, habites and vertues bien not in natural uertual mytes, 
for suche habites and vertues inclineth potencial vertues to do wel 
o p e r euel, 
as a vicious habite inclyneth to do euel, 
and as a vertuous habite inclineth to do wel. 
Panne for kynde is inclyned and determined to oon, 
and potencial vertues bien fol inclyned by kynde to worche 
by here owne kynde, 
and so therby we bep noþer vertuous ne vicious 
as we speketh heere of vertueus and of vices; 
and so gerinne may not be suche vertues. 
And by p e s a m e p r e resouns by p 
e whiche it is preued p a t vertuees bien not in p e natural potencial vertues, 
it may be preued 
p a t p e i bien not in p e knowyng of p e fif wittes. 
For as we ben nouþt ipreysed noþer iblamed for natural potencial vertues, 
so we ben not ipreysed noþer iblamed 
for p e fife wittes; 
for as no man is preysed 
for a gode man 
for he hap a g o d e digestion and wexyng, 
so man is <not> presed for scharp sigt and gode hiryng, 
but if it fallen by hap oper yf a man is ble|r col. eyed and his sist apeired for greet etyng and drynkyng, 
oþer gif he hath euel digestioun 
or feblenesse of stomachus <for etyng, aliter> he schold be blamed 
<for ouer mych drinkyng, aliter>, 
and nougt for he hath yuel dygestioun, 
noþer for feble sigt <‡> - 
for scharp sight and good digestioun [is not] in oure power propurliche for to speke - 
but he schulde be blamed fore 
he hath itake 
to muche of mete and of drynke, 
for it was in his powere 
to ete and drynke mesurableliche. 
v Pe secunde, moral vertue is not in pe potencial vertue of þe fyue wyttes, 
for as pe kynde potencial 
vertues beþ nog obedient to reson, 
for by reule of resoun 
no man hap more digestioun oþer lasse, 
noþer more growyng oþer lasse: 
so pe fif wittes bien not obedient to resoun, 
for it is not in manis power 
to se oper heitlerlich oper dymlich; 
and gif moral vertue folweth resoun, 
þanne vertue is not in fife wittes. 
Pe þridde, 
moral vertue is not in peFIFOwittes; 
for as pe natural potencial 
vertues bep fol set to here worchyng 
by here owne kynde, 
so bien pe wittes also. 
For as pe fuyre heteth wiþ al his mygt, 
for it worcheth 
by his owne kynde 
and is þerfore 
noþer preysed noþer iblamed, 
noþer þerinne is moral vertue: 
so for pe potencial vertue of digestioun makeþ 
as gret digestioun as he may, 
and pe eyge seeth 
as moche as he may, 
gerinne may no moral vertue be iset. 
For by <natural> vertue, 
potencial vertue is iset awork 
atte folle by here owen kynde and nedeþ þerfore no moral vertue. 
And so moral vertue 
is not in natural potencial vertue, 
noþer in potencial vertues of pe fife wittes; 
and oþer potencial vertues ben þ e r e nougt bute the intellectualle <vertu> 
þat is pe vnderstondyng 
and pe appetite sensytyue and intellectiue. 
Panne | in soche potencial f. vertues mot be moral vertues. 
r Chapter II 
For it is schewed 
þat moral vertues ben nougt 
in naturel potencial vertues of felyng, 
now it is to schewyng hou vertues bien distyngwed 
and how þei bien 
in pe intellectual inwit 
and in pe appétit. 
Panne it is to distynguyng of vertues 
and of suche potencial vertues. 
For som vertues ben intellectual, 
and som moral, 
and somme mené bytwene intellectual and moral. 
Pe intellectual vertues bien in þe inwit 
p a t hatte intellectus speculatiuus, 
p a t is pe schewyng of þe inwit, 
and soche vertues bien speculatif sciens, 
as natural philosophi, gemetrie, and methaphisik, 
and oper suche. 
And pure moral vertues bien in pe appetite sensitif oper intellectif. 
And soche vertues bien iusticia, temporancia, fortitudo, mansuetudo and oþer soche, 
of pe whiche we schal trete syngulerlich. 
Pe mene vertues bytwene intellectual and moral bep in pe inwyt, 
p a t h a t t e intellectus practicus, 
as prudencia and oþere vertues 
p a t longeþ þerto. 
Pe comentor super libris Ethicorum seith p a t prudencia 
is acounted a mene vertue 
bytwene moral vertues and intellectual vertues 
and may natheles be accounted with [morlal vertues. 
But prudencia is not but in goode men 
as morel vertues 
beth not bote in gode men. 
Schrewed men, 
þeig p e i mowe be kunnynge, 
falce and gylefole, 
þei mowe not be prudentes, 
as it schal be declared 
in pe place þerof. 
Perfore, [vi] Ethicorum, 
it is iseid p a t it is inpossible 
to be prudens and not good. 
Panne we leuejs pe vertues intellectual and sciens speculatif 
and schal trete of prudencia and of moral vertues. 
For as we hauen ofte seyd, 
we taken þis werk not for to be kunnynge | 
bote for to be good, 
col. for goodnesse may not be in vs withoute prudencia and moral vertues. 
Þes vertues may be in pe inwit, 
p a t hatte intellectus, 
p a t is to say vnderstondyng, 
and in þe appetite also. 
And it is seid 
þat a vertue 
is som what after resoun. 
Panne þe vertue moot be in pe resonable vertue and potencial myst. 
And pe philosofer setteth double resonable, 
oon by his owne essencia, 
and an o p e r by p 
a t he is partener of resoun. 
Pe vnderstondyng and pe inwit p a t hatte intellectus 
is resonable 
by his owne essencia and by itself. 
And pe appetit is resonable 
by þat he is partiner of resoun. 
For þeig pe appétit 
is not intellectus 
and pe silf resoun, 
fit he is aconted partiner of resoun, 
for he may be obedient to resoun. 
Pe natural potencial vertues and peFIFOwittes of felyng 
ben not resonable of hemself, 
nor þei bien not pe silue resoun resoun <and> [þei bien not parteners of resoun nor sogette to resoun] 
in so moche as Jei bien potencial vertues. 
Panne in peFIFOwittes 
and in pe natural potencial vertues 
bien not moral vertues, 
as it is iseide tofore honde; 
but þei bien oonlich in pe inwit and vnderstondyng, 
p a t hatte intellectus, 
and in pe appetite. 
And in vs is double knowyng, intellectif and sensitif. 
For as kynde appetite 
folweth kyndelich þe forme 
p a t a hath by kynde, 
so pe appétit of knowyng 
folweth pe forme þat apprehendeþ and conceyueth by knowyng. 
For as heuy thinges, 
for þei hauen pe fourme of heuynesse, 
p e i hauen also a certeyne kynde inclynacioun and kynde appetit to desire to be bynethe and lowe, 
so þei p a t hauen knowyng, 
in p a t [pei] hauen in hemself pe fourme p a t is conceyued, 
p e i hauen also som inclinacioun 
and some appetit 
as p a t fourme moueþ. 
Perfore as we hauen double knowyng, 
| sencitif and intellectif, 
so we f. hauen doble appetit; 
sencitif þat folweþ þe fourme 
p a t is conceyued 
by pe wit of felyng, 
and intellectif þat is pe forme p a t is conceyued by pe vnderstondyng, 
p a t hatte intellectus. 
And pe appétit sencitif is double. 
For bestes bien aboue soules þynges and kynde 
eueth double potencial vertue 
to elementis and to soules kynges, 
oon by pe whiche þei desiren here owne reste and anoþer 
by þe whiche p 
e i withstonden þynges 
þat letteþ and bien contrary, 
moche more kynde iseueþ 
to bestes double potencial vertue, 
for p e i bien more parfit Jeanne soules kynges. 
We seeþ p a t fuyre is hoot and list by kynde, 
and by litnesse desireth his owne place 
and quyete acordyng þerto, and worcheþ 
by hete and withstondeþ thynges p a t bien contrarie þerto. 
Panne for fuyre schulde not be ilet by contrarieþcyngysto reste by litnesse in his owne place, 
kynde eueth þerto potencial vertue to hete 
þat it may þerby worche and withstonde þinges 
þat ben contrarie and corumpeþ) fyre. 
Þan gif kynde feueth to fyre 
and to soules kynges double potencial v vertue, 
oon by pe whiche he geteth here owne quiete and reste, 
and a n o p e v 
by pe whiche he worcheþ 
and withstondeþ 
lettes and contrarie kynges, 
moche more kynde iseueþ to bestes suche potencial vertues. 
Panne kynde geueþ 
to hem double appetit, 
sencitif appetite of felyng, 
oon by pe whiche a purseweþ and cometh 
to here owne quiete and likynge, 
and pis potencial vertue concupiscibilis he higte, 
p a t is coueitisnesse; 
and anofcer by Ipe 
whiche he withstondeþ 
andrese‡eþcontrarie and lettes, 
and p a t hatte irascibilis, 
as it were potencial w r e p . 
So p a t þe concupiscible 
is as it were in stede of ligtnesse and heuynesse 
in ligt þynges and heuy. 
Pe irascibilis is as it were in stede of cold and of hete in colde | þynges and hote. 
For as heuye kynges 
by heuynesse forsakeþ col. þe ouer place 
as not accordynge and cometh to þe nether place 
as conuenient and accordyng, 
and wiþstondeþ 
by cold þynges 
p a t bien contrarie and l e t t e p and saueþ hemself 
þat þey bien not corrupt in here kynde,

so by pe concupiscibilis, 
bestes voyden and forsaken yuel þynges and displesynge,

And by irascibilis

By pe concupiscibilis he gooþ and comeþ 
and tekep mete as þyng

And by pe irascibilis a resep and withstondeþ

þat letteþ hem of here mete. 
Perfore it is wel seid p a t pe concupiscibilis takeþ hede to good 
and to iuel 
[for p e i bien soche, 
and pe irascibilis takeþ hede to good and to iuel] 
in so moche as p e i bien hard to voide oþere to come to. 
For good is desired for it is good, 
and yuel is schoned 
and forsake <for it is euyl>. 
Pe concupiscibilis is inclined and desireth reste and þyng p a t is good and likynge, 
and schoneþ) 
and forsakeþ euel þynges and vnlikyng, 
and hath for obiecte sensible goode and euel for p 
e i bien soche 
(þat is to menyng al p a t is desired or schoned 
and forsake is good oper euel, 
sensible in þat p a t p e i bien sensible). 
By pe irascible we reseth and withstondeþ in p a t 
wyse kynges p a t greueþ vs and letteþ. 
And pe irascibiles, 
p a t is wretheful doyng, 
longeþ to good and yuel, 
not onlich for þey bien suche, 
bote for þei bien gete or kept oper withstonde 
with [h]a[rd] diffecultee. 
For hard difficultee letteþ vs principalliche 
to gete good 
and voyde yuel and harme. 
Panne kynde rulede vnparfitliche 
gif he af to bestes pe concupiscibel 
to desire good 
and to schone and forsake yuel, 
but gif he gaf to hem also | 
pe irascibel 
by þe whiche a reseth f. 
and defende^ and wiþstondeþ greues and lettes 
p a t letteþ hem of delectacion and likyng. 
Panne for bestes scholde haue ful lykynge 
by þe concupiscible in manere 
p a t is accordyng to hem, 
pe irascibel is iseue to hem 
by pe whiche a reseth and wiþstondeþ þynges 
p a t greueth and letteþ hem of delectacioun and likyng. 
Panne pe appetite sencitif of felyng is double, 
irascible and concupiscible. 
r And p e appétit intellectif 
p a t is icleped voluntas, 
p e wille, 
abided and is on and nougt deuyded. 
For p e inwit p a t hatte intellectus concernþ his obiecte more generallich 
p a n p e wit of felyng pat higte sensus. 
Pe appétit intellectif pat folweth p 
e inwit pat higte intellectus 
is more generalliche inclined to goode kynges p 
a n is þe appetite 
þat folweþ þe wit of felyng. 
For p e more generallich a thing is take and conceyued, 
to mo fcynges þe same p 
y n g stryccheþ. 
Peig p e appetit sencitif 
by þe whiche we bep inclyned and desireþ 
sencible kynges pat bien likyng be o p 
e r p a n p 
e appetit sencitif by p 
e whiche we resep and wiþstondeþ greues and lettes, natheles p e appetite intellectif 
is al oon and streccheth to al good 
p a t is intelligible and likynge. 
Panne al by oon appetite intellectif 
we desiren intelligible kynges and likynge and auentreth 
on thynges of difficultee, 
and p a t appetite is not diuers 
as p e appetite sencitif is diuers, 
by p e whiche we desireþ 
sencible þynges 
and likynge and wiþstondeþ greues and lettes. 
And so gif eueriche vertue moral 
is in p e inwit þat hatte intellectus, 
o p e r in þe appetite, 
and som appetite is intellectif, 
o p e r p e wille, 
and som is sencitif, 
and pis is double, 
irascible and concupiscible, 
þanne eueriche vertue moral mot bee | 
in p e inwit pat is intellectus, 
o p e r in p e col. wil, 
o p e r in p e irascible, 
oper in p e concupiscible.‡ Þanne for to speke largeliche of moral vertue, 
as redinesse, hatte prudencia, 
is acounted vertue moral, 
we may saye p a t by pese foure potencial vertues of p e soule in p 
e whiche bep moral vertues, 
foure vertues bien itake 
p a t bien icleped cardinal vertues: pat bien prudencia, iusticia, fortitudo and tem porancia - redinesse, rigtwisnesse, stalwordnesse and temporance. 
For prudencia is in p e intellecte, iusticia in p e wille, fortitudo in p e irascible and temporancia in p e concupiscible. Chapter III Circa finem, ii Ethicorum, 
al withoute prudencia and iusticia, 
p e philosofer rekeneth ten vertues moral 
p a t bien icleped [fortitudo], temporancia, honoris amatiua, magnanimitas, largitas, magnificencia, mansuetudo, Veritas, affabilitas, eutrapelia 
(þat may we clepe bene vertibilitas o p e r societas). 
Panne for to acounte iusticia and prudencia, 
moral vertues bien twelfe, 
of alie p e whiche we schal trete arewe and ho[w] it semeth kynges to haue pese vertues 
and what partyes pey hauen and vertues 
pat longeþ þerto. 
Pe nombre of pese vertues 
may be itake in pis wise. 
For p e subiecte of a vertue is intellectus 
o p e r voluntas, 
p e wille, 
oper p e appetite sencitif, 
euerich vertue moral 
is in p e inwit pat hatte intellectus as prudencia, 
o p e r in voluntate, 
p e wille, as iusticia, 
oper in p e appetite sencitif, 
as p e ten vertues morale 
pat we haueþ irekened, 
of p e whiche p e philosofer speketh, ii Ethicorum. 
Pes vertues mowe be itake 
in anoþer manere in pis wise, 
for vertues bien I men[e] 
and bien not but in þynges p a t b i e p in oure powere in p e f. whiche it is semelich 
p a t we sette mené, 
euenes and †vnneuenes†, 
and suche bien þre: resons, passions and outward worchyng. 
By vertues we schal haue ritful resouns 
and moderate passiouns 
and outward workys, 
skylful and moderate and mesurable. 
In p a t J we haue)} 
ritfoul resouns prudencia is itake, 
in p a t we hauen in p e otter workes mesurable in equyte iusticia is itake, 
and in p a t we hauen moderate passiouns, 
p e ten vertues moral bien itake of p 
e whiche we made mencioun in p e bygynnyng of pis chapitre. 
Panne iusticia is in wille 
and is diuers 
and o p e r p a n p 
e ten vertues pat bien in p e appétit sencitif. 
For eiper moderateth owtward workes and passiouns 
p a t b i e p in p e appetit sencitif, 
but p a t he d o p diuersliche. 
For p e ten vertues moderateþ principaliche p e passions 
([þat] ben moderate in p e appetites) 
and he moderateth outward workes and dedes by moderate passiouns. 
For if p e innere passiouns bien moderate, 
we fondeþ to do moderateliche outward workes and dedes. 
But iusticia d o p aeward ritteth and moderateth 
frist outward kynges and workes and dedes 
and d o p p 
a t euerich man haue his owne 
and what is thewe pat he haue. 
And gif iusticia moderateþ and tempereþ meuynges and passiouns 
þat ben in p e appetite, 
p a t is t o schewyng þertofore gif þe ottere thinges, workes and dedes, 
ben moderat and areuled Crist, 
þanne in vs passions 
ben moderat and rewled Crist. 
In p e iii manere pis diuision 
may be take in pis wise, 
for eueriche vertue moral tendeþ 
and inclineth to good of resoun; 
and tende and incline to good of resoun 
may be in p r e manere wise: 
o p e r makynge good parfite, 
o p e r makyng suche good, 
| o p e r kepynge 
o p e r sauynge col. suche good. 
And prudencia tendeþ 
and inclineþ 
to good of resoun, 
for it p e silfe resoun parfiteþ. 
For prudencia is in p e intellecte as perfeccioun 
is in þe þyng p 
a t is maad parfist. 
And iusticia tendeþ 
and inclyneþ to good, 
for it makeþ suche good. 
For in ottere þynges, workes and dedes, 
iusticia makeþ 
and d o p pat good and rist þat resoun demeþ and axeþ. 
And p e vertues morale tendeþ 
and inclineþ to good of resoun 
as it is comynliche iseyde, 
for he kepeth it and saueþ. 
For suche vertues moderateþ, 
chasteþ and tempereth passiouns 
and makeþ 
þat man be not mysladde by passiouns, 
noJ}er be ibrout out of resoun, 
noþer out of p e good of resoun. 
Þerfore it is iseide 
pat he kepeþ 
and saueth suche goode. 
Panne seie we p a t a moral vertue makeþ resoun ritful 
and is in resoun, 
and makeþ resoun parfit, 
and is prudencia; 
other it is in voluntate, 
p e wille, 
and makeþ þe outward workes 
and dedes rigtful 
and is cause of goode workes and dedes, 
and so iusticia; 
other it is in p e appétit sencitif and moderateþ 
and tempreth passions 
and kepeth and saueth 
p e good of resoun, 
and bep itake in p e ten moral vertues 
v p a t bep yrekened tofore honde. 
Pe nombre þerof and p e sufficiencia 
may be itake in pis wise. 
It is seid tofore honde 
p a t þ i l k e vertues bien aboute passions 
p e whiche a moderateþ principallich and chasteþ and tempereth. 
And of diuers obiectis cometh diuers passiouns; 
p a n n e diuers vertues may be itake, 
as diuers menes in þulke passions 
bien ifounde 
by order of resoun. 
Panne by leue to passe ligtliche 
and by leknesse say we 
p a t passiouns comeþ of good o p e r of yuel. 
gif he cometh of yuel, 
þanne he comeþ of yuel 
p a t is t o comyng o p 
e r of yuel 
p a t is present. 
And if of euel p a t is t o come, 
we haueþ passions, 
drede and hardinesse; 
drede whan we we[r]neþ - <refusen> - such euel, 
and hardi|nesse whanne we auentureth and reseth þeron. 
And betwene f. pese twey passions 
is oon mene and myddel vertue 
and hatte fortitudo. 
Panne is fortitudo mene bytwene p 
e drede and hardynesse and is in p e irascible; 
for drede and hardinesse ben in p e irascible. 
<And þer spekeþ of hardinesse p a t is folehardines; 
but of wis hardines and rediliche ireuled 
and is icleped fortitudo... > And gif suche passions come)) of yuel o p e r harme p a t is ido to vs, 
gif we fondeþ to be awreke of p e harme and despit pat is ido, 
þanne it is ira, 
wrethe, pat desireth wreche, 
and gif we failleth and fondeþ 
not to take wreche 
þanne it is mititas. 
Betwene pes tweye is p e vertue p a t hatte mansuetudo. 
But mansuetudo is not properliche p e vertue pat is bitwene p e twey passiouns 
p a t bien icleped mititas and ira, 
but it is more verreyliche p e passioun 
p a t hatte mititas. 
Nathales as it is seide, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
for we haueþ no proper name 
for p a t vertue, 
it hath p e name of p e passioun 
p a t failleþ of hardynesse 
and is icleped mansuetudo. 
And mansuetudo is in p e irascible, 
for þerinne is mititas and ira, 
as it were myldenesse and wreþþe, 
bytwene p e whiche þat vertue is mene. 
Panne tweye vertues p a t b i e p in p 
e irascible ben bitwene p e passions p a t comeþ of yuel and harme, 
as fortitudo is bitwene passions 
pat cometh of yuel and harme 
p a t is t o comynge, 
and mansuetudo is betwene passiouns 
p a t cometh of euel o p 
e r harme pat is present. 
And gif vertues bien itake 
bytwene passions 
p a t cometh of goode, 
þanne we schal make a distinccioun of good. 
For som good is mannes good in hymself, and som good is his good 
in ordere to o p e r men; 
and manis good in hymself is treble, 
for som good is delectable and likynge, 
as mete | and drynke 
and o p e r e suche. 
And som is profitable, 
col. as mynt and money, 
and som is honestas, honour and worschep, 
and pis noune honestum cometh of honor, 
for honestum is as it were 
p e staat of honor. 
Among passions 
p a t cometh of good 
p a t is delectable 
and likyng cometh 
but on vertue: 
p a t is temporancia and [is] in concupiscible. 
Among p e passions of profitable good bien twey vertues, 
for [oper] soche good is mené 
[and] is so liberalitas 
(o[r] fredom of herte, 
in mene spendynge and cost), 
o p e r suche good 
is passynge howge 
and with r difficulte, 
and is so magnificencia (fredom of herte in passyng spendyng and cost 
p a t bien grete and with difficulté): 
[for] magnificencia is grete doynge. 
Panne liberalitas 
is in pe concupiscible 
and magnificencia is in pe irascible, 
for magnificencia is passyng and with difficulté. 
And if pe good is honeste oþer honor and worschep, 
Joanne p a t honor is mené 
and is þanne comynliche icleped honoris amatiua and honoris amor, 
loue of worschep. 
And if p a t honor is greet, 
þcanne it is magnanimitas, 
p a t stondþ in passyng gret werschep and honor. 
And honoris amatiua 
is in concupiscible and magnanimitas 
in þe irascible. 
And so som delectable good 
and likynge may nougt haue þe resoun of difficulté 
as profitable good and honest. 
Pei b o p e of profitable good 
and honest be twey vertues itake, 
of pe whiche þe oon is [in] þe concupiscibel 
and þe o p e r in þe irascible, 
of delectable good and likynge is but oon vertue itake, 
p a t is in þe concupiscible, 
as temporancia. 
And gif þe vertues bien among passions 
þat comeþ of good in þe whiche we comuneth with o p e r e , 
as it is iseide, ii Ethicorum, 
so bien þre vertues itake. 
For we comuneth with þere men 
in wordes and in dedes. 
| As we comuneth with oþer, 
wordes serueþ vs to sofcnesse and f. verrite, 
to lif and to pleye. 
Panne is treble vertue, Veritas, affabilitas and eutrapilia 
þat may be icleped bona 
v<er>sio. 
As we speken here of Veritas, 
Veritas is vertue not speculatif, 
but as a man is not an ypocrite 
n o þ e r a bostere 
but he is acordynge in wordes 
and in dedes and scheweth 
in whiche he is withowte gyle 
in wordes and in dedes. 
But affabilitas is whan a man is good of conuersacioun of lif, 
and is not contrarious noþer froward ne fatour, 
bote good to speke with and courteys. 
And e[u]trapolia, 
p a t is also icleped bona versio, 
is whan a man can haue hymself wel in pley and in murþe 
so p a t he be not a mynstralle, iaper, ne scorner, 
so p a t he make iapes 
ne scorne of alle kynges, 
noþer a froward boynard 
p a t nofcer play nofcer murþe of no þyng, 
for Jeanne he is icleped agristis; 
but þat he haue hymself 
as a scholde in murþe 
and in playe 
and is fcanne icleped outrapelius 
and bene se vertens. 
Alle pes p r e vertues, 
for he stondeþ not in passynge hard difficulté, 
p e i bien in pe concupiscible. 
And so for foure potencial vertues 
of pe soule fonge] vertues of pe whiche we spekeþ 
at þis tyme, 
suche vertues bien twelue. 
For oon is in pe inwit þat hatte intellectus, 
and oon in volúntate, pe wille, 
and pe foure in pe irascible, 
and sexe in pe concupiscible. 
In pe intellectus is prudencia. 
In voluntate, 
in pe [w]ille, is iusticia. 
In pe irascible is fortitudo, mansuetudo, magnanimitas and magnificencia, 
p a t bien itake in pis wise: 
fortitudo and mansuetudo longeþ to passions 
p a t cometh of yuel 
as fortitudo longeth to passionis 
p a t cometh of iuel 
p a t is to comyng, 
and mansuetudo | to passionis þat cometh of euel 
p a t is present col. 
o p e r ipassed. 
And magnificencia and magnanimitas stondeth 
in passyng good of difficulté 
and p a t diuersliche, 
for magnificencia stonde^ in v The Governance of K i n g s a n d Punces good 
þat is profitable, 
as in greet spence and cost. 
And magnanimitas stondeþ 
in passyng good 
p a t is honest, 
as in greet worschep and honour. 
In pe concupiscible bien sex vertues: temporancia, liberalitas, honoris amatiua, Veritas, affabilitas and eutrapelia; 
and bien itake in pis wise: p r e þerof, 
as temporancia, liberalitas and honoris amatiua stondep in mannys good in hymself and pe o p e r e p r e stondeþ in mannys good 
in ordre to oþere. 
Þanne in e i p 
e r maner good stondeþ þre vertues, 
for man hath þre maner good in hymsilf. 
For som is delectable and likynge, 
and gerinne stondeþ temporancia; 
and som is profitable, 
and þerinne stondeþ liberalitas; 
and som is honeste, 
and gerinne stondelp honoris amatiua. 
Also in ordre to olpere is p r e manere of good; 
somme serueþ vs to schewyng 
and so is Veritas, 
and somme to lyf 
and so is affabilitas, 
and somme to pleye oper pleynge 
and so is eutrapelia. 
And so it is declared hou many soche vertues per help 
and how p e i bien destyngwed. Chapter IV We haue]} destyngwed 
in pe nexte chapitre twelfe vertues, 
of pe whiche oon 
is in pe inwit 
p a t hatte intellectus, 
as prudencia; 
oon in volúntate, 
pe wille, as iusticia; 
foure in pe irascible, 
as fortitudo, mansuetudo, magnanimitas and magnificencia; 
sex in Ipe concupiscible, 
as temporancia and o p e r e Ipe whiche we hauen rekened byfore hond. Panne lest som man wolde wene p a t per bien none olpere goode disposiciouns 
p a n pes vertues 
p a t bien irekened, 
we bien avised for to declare p a t 
(per to speke of good disposicions 
of pe whiche philosofres I spekeþ, 
for of oper at pis tyme 
it is not oure entent 
to make f. i tretees) 
somme <ere> vertues, 
somme serueth to vertues, 
some desposen to vertues 
and some bien aboue vertues. 
Largelich to speke of vertues, 
alle suche goode disposiciouns 
may be cleped vertues. 
Natheles some gode disposiciouns serueth to vertues, 
a[s] good counsaille and good doom of pe kynges 
p a t counsaille is itake of serueth to pe vertue 
p a t hatte prudencia. 
Panne he p a t is wel desposed 
Jserto is desposed 
and able to be prudens, 
wis and redy. 
And so good disposiciouns 
bien not ful vertues 
but p e i disposen to vertues, 
as perseuerancia and continencia 
p a t bien not ful vertues, 
as pe philosofer speke}) here of hem, 
but he desposeth to vertue; 
for he is icleped perseuerans 
þat falleþ not pey he be not tempted, 
and so i a r e p som tyme men p a t 
b i e n not vertuous, 
[for p e i ben not 
passionate,] 
noþer falleþ. 
And he is continens 
p a t is passionat 
and hath strong passions 
and folweth resons and not passioun. 
Panne he p a t is continens 
is not vertuous atte folle, 
for p e i p a t he do wel 
by cause of goode passions, 
natheles he ne hath no likyng 
in p a t good doynge. 
Panne continencia and perseuerancia 
r itake in pes wyse 
is not þe vertue pey p a t it be good disposicioun to vertue. 
Also som good disposicions bien aboue vertue as p e vertue p 
a t higte vertus diuina 
and vertus heroyca and super iusta, 
of p e whiche it is itreted, 
vii Ethicorum. 
For as som men bien 
as it were bestes 
and euyl passyng þe manere of men, 
so som men bien 
as it were goddyche 
and good passyng 
p e maner of mankynde. 
Perfore suche men 
may be cleped super vertuosi, 
passyng vertuouse. 
And suche goddische vertue p a t is som del aboue vertuous schal namliche bien in kynges and in princes pat schulde be as it were half goddysch 
as | it is seyde. col. Pe ferþe, 
som good desposicions bien 
p e selue vertues, 
as iusticia, prudencia, 
and o p e r 
e þe whiche we made mencioun in þe nexte chapitre. 
Panne of alle þes foure we schul speke 
in here awne place. 
For we schul determe of vertues 
and declare how it is semelich 
p a t kynges and princes hauen vertues, 
and we schullen also determe of helpes and disposiciouns 
to vertue 
and of p i l k e þat bien aboue vertue, declarynge how hym nedede p a t kynges and princes bien iheigte 
with suche helpes disposicions and vertues. 
B[ut]firstwe schul speke of p e selue vertues. Chapter V 
Tofore we haueþ irekened twelf vertues, 
but p e i twelf bien not ileche 
alle parfite noþer ileche principallich. 
Holy seyntes and philosofres vsed to make 
disty[n]cciouns of vertues, 
for som bien principale and cardinale and som annexed. 
And p e cardinale vertues bien foure: iusticia, prudencia, fortitudo, and temporancia; 
and p e vertues annexed 
and not principal bien 
p e o p e r e eigte, 
of p e whiche we made mencioun tofore. 
Pat pese foure vertues bien cardinal 
and principale we may declare by p r e weyes. 
Pefirstwey is itake 
by p e mater in p 
e whiche pes vertues stondeþ; 
p e secunde, 
by p e subiecte in p 
e whiche pey bien inne; 
p e þrydde, 
by p e condiciouns 
p a t bien required 
and nedeful to vertues. 
Pe firste is declared in pis wise, 
for eueriche vertue stondeþ 
o p e r in resouns 
or in passiouns, 
o p e r in workes, 
o p e r in dedes. 
For it happen to make resouns rigtfulliche and vnrigtfullyche, 
it nedeþ to geue som vertue p a t is rigtful resoun by p 
e whiche we may make rigtful resouns of werkes and dedes. 
Also for it happeþ to worche rigtfullich and vnrigtfullych, 
as p e r is a vertue igeue by p 
e whiche al ben irouled 
in makyng resones of | workes and dedes, 
so p e r is a vertue by p e whyche f. we bien irulede in workes and dedes. 
Also for it happeþ vs to be pascionate rigtfulliche and vnrygtfullyche, 
it n e d e p t o geue vertues by p 
e whiche we may be modefiede in p e same passiouns. 
Panne for som passiouns 
exciteth vs to iuel, 
as p e v passiouns 
þat bien concupiscibele and likyng, 
for we bieth inclyned and sone assentynge 
to suche passyons, 
and some passions wiþdraweþ vs from good 
as þe passions irascible, wrethful, 
it nedeþ to geue 
som vertues lest passions 
incline vs to þynges 
pat is agenst resoun. 
And also it nedeþ to geue anoþer 
vertue lest passions 
wiþdrawe vs fram þynges 
þat resoun axeth. 
For eueriche vertue rectifieþ 
and makeþ resons rigtful, 
oper euenep dedes and workes, 
oper modefiej} 
and chasteþ passiouns 
pat þey brynge vs not to do agenst resoun, 
o p e r modefyeþ þe passions 
þat he withdraweþ vs not fro þyng þat resoun a x e p . 
And for prudencia principalliche makeþ rigtfol resouns; 
iusticia principalliche equite and rigtfulnesse 
in workes and dedes; 
temporancia principalliche modefieth 
and chasteþ passions 
þat þey brynge vs not to doun agenst resoun; 
fortitudo principallich modifieth 
and chasteth passions 
p a t þei wiþdrawe vs not fro kynges 
p a t resoun axeth; 
and so by cause of p e mater in p e whiche soche vertues stondeþ 
þes foure vertues bien cleped principale and cardinale, 
for p e i stonden in p 
e matier in p 
e whiche principal occupacioun is of mankynde. 
Pe seconde wey to declare p 
a t þes vertues bien cardynale and principale may be itake by p 
e subiecte in p 
e whiche p 
e i bien | inne. 
For it is col. 
seid tofore pat p e vertues p 
a t we spekeþ of at pis tyme bien in potencial vertues of p e soule: 
in intellectu, in voluntate, 
in irascibili and in concupiscibili. 
Panne for p e intelle[c]te p a t hatte intellectus practicus, 
p e principal vertue is prundencia; 
in voluntate, 
p e wille 
(for to speke of vertues pat cometh of goode dedes), 
p e principal vertue is iusticia; 
and in p e irascible, 
p e principal vertue is fortitudo; 
and in p e concupiscible 
p e principal vertue is temporancia. 
Perfore pese foure vertues, prudencia, iusticia, 
and temporancia and fortitudo, 
bien icleped vertues cardinales and principales. 
Pe þridde wey is itake by p e condiciouns p 
a t bien required and nedful to eueriche vertue; 
for eueriche acte and dede, 
gif it schal be vertuous, 
mot be doun with prudencia, fortitudo, iusticia and temporancia. 
Perfore pes foure vertues 
bien principalliche icleped cardinales and principales. 
And in o p e r moral vertues 
may be som principalite 
as magnanimitas hath som principalte 
ouer o p e r vertues. 
For as p e philosofer seide, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
magnanimitas semeth 
a maner ornament 
and heighnesse of alle o p e r e vertues. 
Also magnificencia hath som principalte 
for greet cost and spenses in p 
e whiche it stondeþ. 
And o p e r e vertues hauen som principalte, 
bote pes foure bien principalliche icleped principales and cardinales; 
but how p a t is in p e processe p a t schal be made of eueriche of hem 
it schal be declared 
at p e folle. 
Panne for pes foure bien cardinales 
and more principal þan o p e r e , 
first it is to spekyng of p e foure. 
Also for prudencia 
is more principal p a n al p e oper, 
for it rewleþ al p e o p e r e ; 
and iusticia is more principal 
þan fortitudo and temporancia, 
for iusticia stondeþ 
in byeng and sellyng and changyng of þynges in distribucioun of giftes and catel 
and of good in þe whiche oure lif is occupide; 
and | for fortitudo is more f. principal þanne temporancia, 
for fortitudo is more ordeined 
to þe comyn profit þan is temporancia; 
perfore þis schal be þe ordre. 
For first we schulle telle what is prudencia, 
and þat [it] is semeliche 
þat kynges and princes haue prudencia. 
[Pe secunde, 
we schulle determe of þe vertue of iusticia, 
and schewefcatit is semeliche 
þat kynges and princes haue iusticia] 
and be ritful. 
Panne we schulle determe of fce vertues þat hatte fortitudo and temporancia, 
and declare þat it is semeliche 
fcat kynges and princes 
haue þe vertues 
þat hatte fortitudo and temporancia. 
Panne we schulle determe of þe vertues 
þat hatte magnanimitas and magnificencia, 
and of oþer vertues, 
declarynge how it is semelich 
þat kynges and princes be parfite in suche vertues. 
r Chapter VI Prudencia, 
of þe whiche we thenken firste trete, 
it may be ilikned to diuers thinges; 
and as it is ilikned to diuerce fcynges, 
it is diuersliche discreued. 
And as it longeth tofcisdoynge, 
we may likne prundencia 
to vertues morale, 
fce whiche he gouerneth and ruleth; 
to vertues intellectuale, 
to þe whiche he commandeth and hotefc; 
to þe matier in þe whiche he is occupied; 
to science and to craft 
fro þe whiche he is destyngwed. 
Prudencia ruleth vertues moral for vertues moral inclinefc 
to ende þat is accordyng þerto, 
as temporancia inclineth 
to sobernesse 
and to hate seruice of Venus, 
and we may not incline to accordyng ende of temporancia nofcer 
to þe ende of oþere vertues morale 
but we wete and knowe 
in what wise we may come to suche an ende by prudencia. 
Panne by moral vertues we ordeyneth 
to vs accordynge and þewe endes; 
but by prudencia 
we bien ireuled and comen to þilke endes. 
And prudencia takeþ endes of vertues moral 
and by thinges 
þat bien iordeyned to þe ende 
prudencia ruleþ and ledeþ to þcylke endes. 
Perfore as prudencia | 
is ilykned to vertues moral, 
prudencia may be col. 
affined and descreued in fcis wise: 
prudencia is perfeccioun 
of fce inwitte fcat hatte intellectus, 
ofcer good qualité of fce saule and fcout, 
rulyng and ledyng 
tofceende of vertues morale. 
Pe secounde, 
prudencia may be likned to vertues intellectuale, 
fce whiche he hotefc and commandefc. 
As it longeth to fcis doyng, if we wollefc do redyliche and welle in workes and dedes, 
fcre thinges bien nedful to vs. Firste, 
we schul fynde diuers weyes; 
fce secounde, 
we schal deme of þe weyesfcatbien 
ifounde;fcefcridde,we schul hote and commaunde 
fcat workes and dedes be ido 
in þe weyesfcatbien ifunde and idemed. 
As gif we wolde take a castel 
by workes and dedes of armes, 
firste we schul fynde weyes and caste 
by eche maneres of doyng 
wherby pe castel may be itake. 
Pe seconde, 
we schul deme gif pe weyes 
p a t bien ifounde bien [good] 
to come þerby to pe purpos. 
Pe þridde, 
we schul hote and commande to worche and to do in pe weyes of maners 
p a t bien ifounde and idemed. 
Panne in oure intellect and vnderstondynge schal be p r e vertues: 
oon by pe whiche we may wel fynde and take good counceille and pes vertues 
pe philosofer clepeth euburia, 
p a t is to menyng good counceillyng, 
vi Ethicorum. 
And another vertue 
by pe whiche we may wel deme of weyes and maneres 
p a t bien ifounde 
and pe philosofer clepeth pis vertue synesys, 
p a t is pe vertue of good demyng. 
Pe þridde vertue by pe whiche we may hote and commaunde to wirche and to do in pe weyes of maneres p a t bien ifounde and idemed, 
and pis vertue we clepeþ prudencia. 
Panne in comparisoun 
to pe vertue of fyndyng 
and to pe vertue of demyng, 
prudencia is icleped 
a vertue of hotyng 
and comman|dyng, 
f. for what pe oþer twey vertues fyndeþ and d e m e p , 
prudencia hoteþ and commandeþ p a t it be do o p e r ileft. 
Panne prudencia ruleth 
and l e d e p to workes and dedes more p a n dop pe vertue of fyndyng or of demyng, 
for prudencia hoteþ and commandeþ to doun soche workes and dedes. 
Panne for in moral matier workes and dedes bien acounted best, 
prudencia p a t is nere to workes and dedes is better vertue 
p a n pe vertue of fyndyng or of demyng. 
Panne in comparison to pe vertues of fyndyng and demyng 
p a t ben vertues intellectual, 
prudencia may be discreued in þÍS wise: 
prudencia is a vertue of hotyng and comaundyng of byng 
p a t is ifonde and idemid. Panne so, vi Ethicorum, 
it is iseide p a t 
as euburia fyndeþ 
and synesys demeþ, 
so prudencia hoteþ and commaundeþ. 
Pe þridde, 
prudencia may be ilikned 
to pe matier 
in pe whiche it is occupide tofore. 
Prudencia, 
pe whiche is ioccupide 
in workes and dedes, 
and workes and dedes bien singuler, 
prudencia mot be ioccupiede 
with singuler and particuler dedes 
and applie general rules 
and singuler dedes 
as it is declared, 
vi Ethicorum. 
Panne in comparisoun to pe matier 
in pe whiche it is occupide, 
prudencia may be discreued in pis wise: 
prudencia is a vertue p a t take}) hede and demeþ particular dedes by general rules; 
and suche general rules beep good lawes 
and p e w e vsage and customes 
by pe whiche we may be irewled in workes and dedes. 
Pe ferþe, prudencia is ilikned to sciens 
fram 
pe whiche it is distyngwed, 
for propreliche to speke sciens 
is [of] ‡nescessarie kynges 
p a t chaungeþ 
not as Bois seith, primo Arithmetrice, 
and seith þat sciencia 
is of þynges 
p a t chaungeþ not. 
Prudencia is of workes and of dedes of mankynde and of þynges 
p a t chaungeth 
and is in owre power to do o p e r to leue. 
Perfore as | prudencia and sciencia bien diuerse, 
col. v prudencia may be diffined and discreued in þis wise: 
prudencia is rithtful reson of p y n g e s p 
a t chaungeth and beth in oure power. 
Pe fifthe, prudencia may be ilikned to art and to craft fram p e whiche he is destingwed, 
for art is of thinges 
þat may be wrougt and imade 
and required not rigtfulle wille 
and prudencia is of workes 
and of dedes 
and requireth rigtful wille and appetite. Perfore it is iwrite, 
vi Ethicorum, 
þat artifex, 
p e craftes man, 
þat failleth wilfulliche 
is beter p a n he 
þat failleth ayenst his wille; 
and prudens, 
he p a t hatte prudencia 
and failleth wilfulliche, 
is worse. 
Panne in workes and in dedes 
p a t serueth to art and to craft, 
bettre it is to faille wilfulliche þanne vnwilfulliche; 
but in workes and dedes 
þat serueth to þe lif 
in þe whiche workes 
and dedes prudencia is occupied, 
worse it is to faille wilfulliche þanne vnwilfulliche. 
Panne for no man 
may be prudens and haue prudencia, but he be good and haue rigtful wille, 
prudencia is not ars 
but a vertue. 
Pan as prudencia is likned to art fram 
p e whiche it is destingwed, 
it may be diffined in þÍS wise: 
prudencia is rigtful reson of workes and dedes and requireth rigtful wille. 
Of alle þese we may make on discripcioun of prudencia and say pat prudencia is a vertue intellectuale, 
þat ruleth vertues moral and hoteth and commaundeth 
by þynges pat bien ifounde and idemed 
and t a k e p hede and demeth, 
by general particulate reules, werkes and dedes þat chaungeth and varieth and requireth rigtful wille. Chapter VII 
For it is iseie 
what is prudencia 
and declared þat by prudencia 
we bien iruled arigt to good ende to p 
e whiche ende we | 
beth enclined f. 
by vertues moral, 
it is to declarynge 
þat it is semelich 
p a t kynges and princes be prudentes, 
and haue pis vertue prudencia. 
As it longeth to pis doyng a kyng schal take most hede 
to þre kynges: first, 
it longeth to hym to take hede 
þat he be verrey kyng in dede and nougt onlich in name. 
Pe secunde, he schulde Studie bisiliche p a t his principate 
be not turned in to tirandyse. 
Pe þridde, 
he schal Studie bisiliche 
þat he be kyndelich lord. 
Panne by p r e weyes we may declare p a t it is semeliche toa kyng to be prudens. First, 
for withoute prudencia 
he is nougt verrey kyng 
in dede but onlich in name; 
þe seconde, 
lest he turne to tiranny; 
the third, 
for withoute prudencia 
he may not be kyndelich lord. 
Pe firste wey is declared in þÍS wise: 
a[s] |DÍS name kyng 
is a name of offis and dignité, 
for a kyngis offis is to gouerne 
and to rule his puple in to þe p e w ende and p 
a t is knowe 
by a kynges Latyn name, 
p a t is rex, 
and comeþ of regendo, 
gouernynge and reulynge, 
þanne gouernynge and reulynge of oþer men in to p 
e w ende is by prudencia. 
And so, vi Ethicorum, 
it is seid in pis wise, 
we h o l d e þ hem prudentes 
pat may se and knowe and purueye good 
to hemself and to oþere. 
Panne se and r knowe tofore honde 
is a certeyn yge, 
by p e whoche good [is] iseye and iknowe a p e w ende. 
Panne he [pat] lacked pis eige may not see at folle 
þat good noþer 
p a t p e w ende, 
in to p e whiche þe puple schulde be gouerned and ruled. 
Panne as an archer 
þat mygtnougatrule his schote to p e marke 
but gif he sepe p e marke, 
so noþer a kyng may rule 
p e puple and gouerne in to p e w ende 
but he see and knowe 
p a t ende by prudencia. 
Panne for wiþoute | prudencia no [man] may gouerne and rule p e col puple and brynge hem to a p e w ende, 
wiþoute prudencia no man 
is verrei kyng in dede 
and as a scholde þei he be ifeyned a kyng 
and icleped kyng by name. 
For it semeth p a t a man 
withoute prudencia iset in kynges dignité 
is as a counter of bras oþer of leed ileyd 
in acounttes of marchaundise. 
For marchauntes acountteþ and leggeth som tyme a counter of bras oþer of leed 
in stede of a þousand pounde; 
and so p e counter þat is not worthy oon ey stondeþ? 
for þe valewe of greet prise. 
Panne þat counter is signe and tokene of valewe 
and is not worthi 
p e valewe. 
So gif a man withoute prudencia 
is in dignité of a kyng, 
for he is of a litel valew 
and is iset in stede of greet valew, 
he is signe of a kyng 
and not verrey kyng. 
Panne to be verrey kyng 
in dede and nout onliche icleped kyng by name, 
it is semelich 
þat he haue prudencia. 
Pe secunde, 
p a t is semelich to hym 
lest he turne ligtliche to tyrandise, 
for it is seid |þat by prudencia 
we bien igouerned and reuled and ibrout to good ende to p 
e whoche ende we bep inclined by vertues morale. 
He þat is prudens schal knowe and porueye good 
to hym and to oþere and gouerne and reuleþ hym and oþere to p e best ende. 
Panne gif a man lackeþ prudencia by p 
e whiche we bien iruled to p 
e best good in dede, 
ligtliche he bycometh a tyraunt; 
for richesse and outward goodes, 
pat semeth hym best, 
he troweth pat he be p e best in dede; 
and for p e i p a t bep not prudentes 
knoweth not but sencible good 
as richesse and outward good, 
an vnwys kyng withoute prudencia, 
for he knoweth not ne telleþ pris 
but of sencible good, 
he leueth vertues | 
and setteth al his Studie 
to gadery 
and haue greet richesse 
and f. is sencible good. 
Panne he schal spoyle and robbe 
p e puple and by lord 
by tyraundyse and recche not 
in what manere wyse 
he may gadery richesse and money. 
Pe þridde, 
it is semelich þat kynges haue prudencia 
for þerwiþoute 
p e i mowe not be kyndelich lordes. 
For as it is declared, i Poleticorum, 
p a t som man is kyndeliche a seruaunt 
for a failleth intellecte 
and vnderstondyng 
and can not rule hymself. 
And som man is kyndeliche a lord 
for he hath good intellecte, 
vnderstondyng and prudencia 
and can rule hymself 
and oj^ere in to p 
e w and good manere and ende. 
Nougt onlich philosofres alloweth 
and preyseth pis vertue 
but also alle gouernans confermeth p e preysyng of pis vertue. 
For we seyen 
J^at kyndelich men hauen lordschipes of bestes, 
and men of wommen, 
and olde men v of children. 
Kyndeliche men hauen lordeschipe of bestes 
for in mankynde is prudencia, 
and of prudencia 
and of art bestes hauen litel part. 
Also men bien lordes of wymmen, 
for as it is declared, 
i Politicorum, 
a womman hath feble counsaile for comunliche 
a womman failleth 
and lacketh prudencia of men. 
And gif som wemmen bien prudentes, 
ofcer more 
prudentesfcanmen,fcatis but selde and fewe suche bien ifunde. 
Panne for fce more del womman schal be kyndeliche söget to man 
for kyndeliche here 
lacketh to fce prudencia of man. 
Also in fcis wise 
it is semelich to gongelinges 
to be kyndelich söget to olde men, for fcei bien not expert in workes and in dedes nofcer hauen so greet prudencia 
as oolde men hauen. 
Panne eueriche 
where som is kyndelich seruaunt, 
somme is kyn|delich a lord. 
Vpon a prince is greet prudencia col. 
andfceroffailleth hefcatis kyndelich a seruant. 
Panne so þat a kyng be kyndelich a lord it nedeth 
þat he haue greet prudencia 
and intellecte and vnderstondyng. Chapter VIII 
For no thing is ihad hoolich and parfiteliche 
but alle þe parties 
þerof be ihad also. 
Perfore gif a man schal be parfitliche prudens 
hym nedefc to haue 
alle þat conquereth to prudencia 
and alle þe parties þerof. 
Comonliche eigte parties of prudencia 
beþ asignyd: memoria, mynde; forsigte and poruyans; intellecte, vnderstondyng; racio, resoun; solercia, 
wys besynesse, scley and war; docilitas, abelnesse 
to lerne and to teche; experiencia, redy assay; 
and caucio, redy warnesse. 
Wherfore gif a kyng ofcer a prince schulde be prudens hym nedeth 
to be of good mynde 
and forsite and poruyance 
and intelligent and vnderstondynge; resonable, wislich besy, sleigh and war; 
able to lerne and to teche; 
and knowyng workes and dedes by assay; 
and wisliche warre. 
And þes eigte parties of prudencia 
may be itake in þis wise, 
for as it is declared tofore honde a man is icleped prudens 
for he is suffisaunt to gouerne hymself 
and ofcere to good ende. 
Panne here we schul take hede of foure: 
of þe good endes to þe whiche he gouernefc and reuleth; 
of þe manere in þe whiche he gouerneth and ruleth; 
and offcepersone and þe puple 
þe whiche he gouerneth and ruleth. 
By resoun of þe good to fce whiche he gouerneth and reuleth, 
it nedeth a kyng to be of gode mynde of forsight and puruyaunce. 
For fce manere infcewhiche he gouernefc and reuleth hym nedeth to be intelligent and vnderstondyng and resonable. 
By cause of his owne persone fcat gouerneth and reuleth ofcere hym nedeth to be wis|liche besy, 
f. i sleigh and ware 
and able to lerne and teche and redy and warre; 
for gif a kyng schal gouerne and rule men 
and puple to good ende, 
hym nedefc to haue 
in mynde of fcynges 
fcat bien apassed 
and be war of fcyngesfcatschal come. 
For we schul haue mynde offcyngesfcatbien r apassed, 
not p a t [we] may chaunge kynges 
p a t bien apassed, 
for p a t may no worldlich man do, 
but it is semelich þat a kyng haue 
in mynde of kynges pat bien apassed 
p a t he may þerby knowe 
what may befalle herafter. 
For it is iwrete, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
in workes and dedes þat chaungeth, 
for p e more deel kynges 
p a t schal come 
ben [lyche to] kynges 
p a t bien apassed. Pe seconde, 
it nedeth to knowe 
and be war of kynges þat schal come, 
for men pat knoweth and beeth war of good kynges 
p a t bien to comynge bythynkeþ and casteth 
by what weyes he may best come þerto. 
Panne by cause of good to p 
e whiche a kyng schal rule 
and gouerne his men and his puple, 
it is nedful pat he knowe and be war 
[of kynges þat schal come], 
pat he may pe b e t t r e come þerto. 
And it is spedful 
J^at he haue mynde of jsynges 
pat bien apassed 
pat he may þ e r b y wete and knowe what he schal do here after. 
And by cause of p e manere in 
^e whiche he gouerneth and reuleth it nedeth JDat he haue intellecte, vnderstondyng and resoun; 
for pe manere in p 
e whiche a kyng gouerneth and reuleth his men 
and his puple 
mot be manere of mankynde, 
for a kyng is a man and a man 
vnderstondeth makynge resouns and discurrynge and taketh knowleche of oon 
by a n þ e r ; 
for he takep certeyn principales 
and certeyne premys sis, 
of p e whiche he draweth and takep conclusions 
þat he wol haue and pat bien 
in spéculatif and in actif workes and dedes. 
For as resons bien imad to schewe and proue to | knowe what is soth, 
so bien resouns col. 
imad for euidence to knowe what is good to wynne and to gete. 
Panne by cause of suche connynge and knowleche 
pat is ieue to mankynde, 
he p a t wol rule 
oj^ere mot be intelligent, 
vnderstondyng and knowyng principles 
and pr[emissis] 
and he mot be resonable 
and könne make resons and drawe and take of þe premissis conclusions 
p a t he wol haue; 
o p e r he mot be intelligens, 
vnderstondyng and knowyng good lawes, 
vsages and custumes and oþere 
p a t m a y be principlis and rules of workes and dedes; 
and he mot be resonable 
and knowe and se by þilke rules 
what is to doynge. 
Panne as by cause of good to p 
e whiche he gouerneth and reuleth, 
it nedeth a kyng haue mynde and knowe and be war; 
so by cause of p e manere in p 
e whiche he gouerneth and reuleth 
hym nedeth to be intelligent, 
vnderstondyng and resonable. 
But by cause of his owne persone pat gouerneth and reuleth 
o p e r e , 
hym byhoueth to be wyselich besy, 
redilich sligh and ware, 
and able to lerne and to teche; 
for he p a t is iset so highe and hath so moche to gouerne 
and to reule 
mot be besy and wislich ware 
{sat he may knowe and fynde of hymsilf 
what is good to his men and his puple. 
Also for no man is suffisaunt to bethenke al thing pat may be good and profitable 
to alle p e regne, 
with al þat pat is spedful 
to a kyng 
to be besy and sligh of hymself to bethenke 
what is good and profitable to p e regne, 
hym nedeth to be able to lerne, 
and to do by counsaile of o p e r e men. 
We may saye of a kyng pat is iseid of magnanimus, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
p a t it is not semelich to hym to fie and voyde warnyng, 
for it is not semelich to a kyng 
to fol we his owne heed 
in alle kynges | 
nother alwey triste 
in his f. owne sleighthe; 
but hym nedeth be able to lerne 
p a t he be able to take doctrine and lore of oþere 
and do bi lore 
and conseille of þe eldeste wise barons 
þat l o u e þ þe regne. 
And so it is declared pat by cause of his owne 
persone pat gouerneth and reuleth 
o p e r e it nedeth a kyng 
to be wisliche besy, 
sleigh and war, 
but by cause of men and puple 
pat he gouerneth and ruleth hym nedeth to be expert and ware. 
And for experiencia is of particuler £>yngis, 
perfore as diuerse kynges ben particuler 
and as a man is occupide 
aboue diuerce men and puple, 
so diuers kynges mote be knowe. 
Than it nedeth a prince 
to be expert 
touchyng men and puple, 
þat he is euere knowynge particuler conditions of þe puple 
pat he hath to kepyng 
pat he may p 
e bettre gouerne and reule hym to good ende. 
Pe laste, hym nedeth to be war 
as in spéculatif falsnesse 
is som tyme imedled with sothnesse, 
wherfore som thynges 
p a t bien not soth bot semeth soth ben itrowed as for soth, 
so in workes and in dedes yuel is medled 
w i p good wherfore somme thinges 
bien trowed goode 
and bien not goode 
but semen goode. 
Perfore it nedeth a kyng to be ware 
and forsake thing 
þat is not good but in semynge, 
and chese byng p a t is good in dede to þe whiche he schal gouerne and rule men and puple 
þat he hath to kepynge. V Chapter IX 
In settynge and restynge þe saule is imade prudens as p e philosofre meneth, 
vii Poleticorum; 
Jeanne gif kynges and princes desiren 
to be prudentes 
he scholde not be occupied in vanite 
but he schulde spende p e more deel of here 
lyf tyme in Jsynkynge and castynge 
what may be good and profitable for p e rewme. 
Bot pis schal not be vnderstonde in þÍS wise, menynge þat kynges and princes schulde haue no pleyes and ga|mes, 
but þei schulle vse pleyes and games so moderatliche þat p 
e i col be not lette in rewlynge of p e rewme. 
Penne pey mow make hemself prudentes to reule kyndelich p e regne. Firste, hauynge in mynde tymes 
p 
a t bien apassed in p 
e whiche tymes þe regne was best ireuled, 
perfore he schal haue mynde ofte tyme of tymes 
pat bien passed by p 
e whiche he may knowe whaat is to done herafter. 
For a kyng schal alwey confourme his reulyng to p e reule 
p a t is apassed vnder 
p e whiche rulyng 
p e regne was most siker and best iruled. 
For as be seyng and knowyng and hauyng in mynde writyng of oolde philosofres we bien 
p e more wis in spéculatif matier, 
so kynges and princes hauynge in mynde actus and dedes of here predecessours may be 
p e more prudentes in workes, actus and dedes. 
[Pe seconde], kynges and princes schulle besily take heede and haue in mynde goode 
p a t may falle heraffter 
and be profitable 
to þe regne and euel and harme þat may greue, 
for þerby he schal knowe 
what may befalle 
and be war to voide 
p e soner yuel and harme and come p e bettre and p e sonere to good. 
Pe þridde, 
p e kyng schal ofte þynke and haue in mynde good custumes and vsages and goode lawes, 
for suche bien most principles 
in workes and in dedes, 
[as] p e intellect and vnderstondyng is of principles. 
Panne þe mo goode lawes, 
vsages and custumes 
a kyng hath in mynde by p 
e whiche he may wete and knowe 
what is to doynge in eueriche nede, p e more is p 
e intellecte and vnderstondyng J occupied aboute actus and dedes. 
Pe ferthe, 
ofte he schal thinke and avise hym how he may reule 
p e regne arigt 
bi suche good lawes, customes and vsages 
and take perof goode conclusions of actus and dedes. 
For it is not inow | to vnder- f. 
stonde and knowe lawes, customes and vsages 
p a t bien principles of actus and dedes, 
but a man be raciónale 
to drawe and to take of suche lawes, 
custumes and vsages 
þew conclusions of nedus, workes and dedes. 
And how þat schal be do we schal declare atte p e folle in p 
e þridde [bok]e, 
p e r e we schulle trete of rulyng of regnes. 
Panne kynges takyng hede to p i l k e eigte pat bien requyred to prudencia, 
of p e whiche we makeþ mencioun in þis chapitre, 
mowe make hemself prudentes. 
Bot for malice corumpeth a prince 
as he 
þat hath corup tast demeth euel of sauors, 
for þyng p a t is swete pey wenen p a t it is bitter and agenward, 
so he pat hath a schrewed wil 
and infecte is blent in his wit 
and vnderstondyng and demeþ euele of actus and dedes. 
For what is not to doynge pey demen 
pat it is to doynge and agenward. 
And so it is wel iseid, 
vi Ethicorum, 
pat it is inpossible 
to be prudens and not good, 
for malice makeþ euel dome and schrewede 
and makeþ a man 
withoute prudencia and vnwisliche for malice 
þat makeþ schrewed wille. 
Perfore gif kynges and princes 
wol be prudentes 
pey mote haue goode mynde 
and forknowynge and wisliche besy, sleigh and war, 
and haue o p e r e disposiciouns 
p a t we speke of tofore. 
Hem nedeþ to be good 
withoute schrewed wille 
lest he do vnwisliche and vnredyliche 
for malice of appetite, 
and lest he deme of what is not to doynge 
p a t it is to doyng. 
r Chapter X The philosofre, 
in v Ethicorum, 
distinguit double iusticia: legalis and equalis. Legalis iusticia 
is som what general 
and in som manere euerich vertue. 
And iusticia equalis 
is som what special and som particular vertue: 
for a man is iustus and legalis 
for he | holdeth and folfilleth col. p 
e comaundement of p e lawe. 
But as it is seid, primo Magnorum Moralium, 
lawe commaundeþ actus 
and dedes of alle vertues, 
for lawe commaundeþ workes 
and dedes of þe vertue 
þat hatte fortitudo 
and workes 
and dedes of temporancia, 
and generalliche alle vertues dedes. 
And so þer it is iseid 
þat iusticia legalis 
is parfitg vertue. 
Also, v Ethicorum, 
it is wrete 
þat lawe comaundeth 
þat no man schal forsake þe scheltrom 
and þe ost noþer fleg away, 
noþer throwe away armour 
noþer wepone, 
and þes longeth to þe vertue fortitudo; 
and commaundefc þat no man schal do spouse breche 
and þat longeþ to temporancia; 
and comaundeþ 
þat no man schal smyte noþer stryue 
and þat longeþ 
to vertu mansuetudo. 
Panne generalliche lawe hoteþ 
to fulfille alle vertues 
and fie alle malice. 
Perfore iusticia legalis 
þat is þe implecioun of lawe 
is in som wise euerich vertue. 
And iusticia equalis 
is a certeyn vertue special 
bi þe whiche eueriche man 
rekeneth rigt and equite 
and what is his owne. 
Pe diuersete of þis twey vertues of iusticia 
may be take in þis wise. 
For as it is iwrete in v Ethicorum, 
iusticia is in ordre to oþere. 
Panne as citeseyns hauen ordre euerich to oþere and to þe comyn profit 
and to hym þat geueth þe lawe 
and to þe kyng, 
and so is among hem iusticia legalis and equalis, 
for among cetesenes 
gif þei hauen suche an ordre, 
oþer axeþ comyn good 
oþer special good and proper, 
gif comyn good is axed 
so 
is among hem iusticia legalis, 
and gif propir good is axed 
so is among hem iusticia equalis. 
For comyn good and profitg cometh 
of alle good 
and profitg of ceteseyns. 
For þe comyn profit 
and alle þe citee is better 
fcan singuler profit hou 
euere þe citeseyns bien good; 
where þei bien good in hemself, 
oþere in ordre to oþere, 
al|wey þat citee is best 
þat is best of f. citeseynes. 
And in þe mo manere wise 
þe citeseyns bien goode, 
þe bettre is þe citee. 
Panne lawes þat bien iordeyned for comyn good and profit [bryngeth forth] 
al manere of goodnesse. 
Panne by rigtful by lawe and fulfille iusticia legalis 
is to folwe al good 
and to voide and fie alle vices and haue 
in som wyse al vertue. 
Perfore iusticia legalis 
is cleped in som wise al vertue for it 
vseth actus and dedes of alle vertues. 
Iusticia legalis is not in dede al vertue for it is distingwyd fro alle eche oþere vertue; 
but it is cleped all vertue 
for it determyneth not to hymself special mater, 
and suche iusticia is distingwed 
fro euerich oþer vertue in tweyne. 
For þei iustus legalis 
do þe same workes and dedes 
þat doþ fortis and temporatus, 
gut he doþ hem not in þe same entent 
and by þe same formal resoun; 
for he þat doþ actus 
and dedes of fortitudo 
and hath likynge 
in suche actus 
and dedes is icleped fortis, 
and he þat doþ dedes of temporancia 
for he hath likyng þerinne 
is icleped temporatus. 
But he þat doþ suche actus and dedes 
and not for he 
hath likynge þerinne 
but for þe lawe 
commaundefc and hoteþ suche actus and dedes 
and he wol fulfille þe lawe, 
he is cleped iustus legalis. 
Panne iustus legalis 
in so moche 
þat he is suche oon 
he hath principal likynge 
in folfillyng of þe lawe. 
Sif he hath likyng v in workes of oþere vertues, 
þat is by consequent folwynge 
for so moche as lawe commanded 
alle suche actus and dedes. 
Andfortus and temporadas and profite in oþere vertues hap first principalliche likynge in workes and dedes of suche vertues; 
and gif he hath likynge 
in fulfillynge of pe lawe 
þat is by consequent folwynge for so moche 
as in doyng | 
of workes and dedes 
he fulfilleþ pe lawe. col. 
Of pis diuersite folweþ þe seconde, 
for whan fortis and temporatus hath likyng 
in workes and dedes of suche vertues, 
p a k e vertues maken hym 
p a t hath suche vertues 
parfitg in hymself 
in so moche 
he is a byng in hymself. 
But iustus legalis hath likyng in suche actus 
and dedes for in so moche as he fulfilled pe lawe iusticia legalis 
makeþ hym nougt parfit 
onlich in hymsilf, 
but it makep hym parfit 
in ordre to pe lawe. 
Pe prince geueth pe lawe 
and þe citées 
geueþ forþ to hem 
þat bien söget to pe commandementis of pe prince 
p a t geueþ pe lawe. 
Pa[nne] he ‡p a t is parfit 
in ordre to þe lawe, 
is parfite in ordre to pe prince 
p a t geueþ pe lawe, 
oþer in ordre to al pe citee 
to pe whiche pe lawe is igeue. 
Panne þeig iusticia legalis 
do pe same actus and dedes p a t dop temporancia and fortitudo, 
git it makeþ a man parfit in ordre to o p e r 
as in ordur to pe prince 
oþer to pe citee, 
not wyþstondynge 
p a t temporancia and fortitudo 
and o p e r 
e suche vertues makeþ 
pe soule parfite in hymself. 
And so it is declared 
how iusticia legalis 
is in som wise eueriche vertue 
and how it determeþ 
not special mater to itsilf, 
but dop actus and dedes of alle vertues. 
But iusticia equalis 
is not eueriche vertue 
noþer dop actus and dedes of alle vertues, 
but determyneth to itself special matier; 
for gerinne pe entent is special good and profit, 
for þey in what manere it euere be p a t a citesen is good 
þerof comeþ comyn good and profit, 
and pe cite es pe bettre; 
and how it euer be þat a citeseyn is euel, 
pe citee is pe worse. 
Perfore natheles not of eueriche goodnesse 
of a citeseyn in hymself 
for he is suche oon ‡ comeþ goodnesse of anojser citeseyn, 
noþer | eueriche f. 
i schrewednesse of on citeseyn dop harme to anoþer cyteseyn. 
But gif a citeseyn is euel in owtward good and catel so þat he wol haue more þerof þanne his owne 
and more þan oþere men, 
þanne þ e r o f comeþ harm to oþere ceteseyns; 
for gif he haue more þerof p 
a n he scholde, 
þanne o p e r e haueþ pe lasse. 
Panne iusticia special, 
by pe whiche special harme is voided 
in so moche as malice 
of pe citeseyn dop harme to anoþer, 
determineth to itsilf special matier and stondeþ 
in pe outward good and catel 
in pe whiche citeseyns comuneth and hauen part. 
And so pis iusticia 
is icleped iusticia equalis, 
for it stondeþ principaliche in equite, rigt and euenes, 
p a t eueriche man haue of suche good and catel as equite wol and euene rigt. 
Perfore it is seid 
þat pis iusticia geldeþ 
to eueriche man his owne rygt, 
for rigt stondeþ 
in a certeyn equite 
and pus pis iusticia geldeþ 
to eueriche man 
what is equite; 
and so it is iseid 
p a t pis iusticia geldeþ 
to euerich man his owne, 
for it is r equite 
and rigt 
þat eueriche man haue his owne. 
Panne gif pes special iusticia 
is cleped equalis and stant in equite and euenes, 
and citeseyns bien partiners 
and hauen suche good and catel 
vneuenliche somme more 
and some lasse 
and p a t in double manere, 
perfore suche par ticuler iusticia is doubled; 
and it happen p a t som men hauen suche good and catel, 
onlich som more and somme lasse, 
by commitacioun and chaungyng 
as in byggyng and sellyng, 
borwyng and lenyng and settyng to hyre. 
For it happeth in bying and sellyng, 
in borwyng and settyng to hire, 
to geue lite and fonge moche agenward 
and p a t may not be withoute inequalite and vnequite. Also inequalite and vnequite 
is som tyme in distribucionis 
in reward and mede, 
for som tyme som men 
þat traueyleth more | 
for p e comyn profite fongeþ 
p e lasse rewarde col. and mede 
and so pis iusticia 
is som del apeyred; 
and for þe more del and comonliche men 
bien acceptours of persons 
and more fauor able to som persones 
p a n to oþere 
and geueth distribucionis and giftis, worschip, 
and good and catel to vnworthi persones 
and putteþ of worthi persones. 
And so p e r is double iusticia special: 
p a t oon hatte commutatiua and stondeth in chaunge of thynges, 
and þe o p e r e hatte distributiua and stondeþ 
in geuyng and delyng of þynges. 
Panne eueriche iusticia 
wheþer it be legalis 
o p e r comutatiua o p e r distributiua makeþ alwey a man parfit 
in ordre to o p e r e . 
But iusticia comutatiua 
and distributiua maken more 
a man parfit in ordre to o p e r e p a n d o p iusticia legalis, 
but in caas here 
of we schul trete in oJDer place. 
Here is so moche iseid p a t p r e bien declared 
p a t were rehersed in p e begynnyng, 
in p e t e n p e chapitre, 
for it is declared 
in how many manere iusticia is icleped. 
For som iusticia is general 
and is icleped legalis, 
and som is special 
and is icleped equalis, 
and p a t is double, 
for som is distributiua and stondeþ 
in delyng of þynges 
and som is comutatiua 
and stondeþ 
in chaungyng of kynges. 
Also it is declared 
in what matière stondeþ iusticia, 
for iusticia legalis stondeþ 
in al p e moral matere and in al p e workes and dedes of vertues, 
and not principaliche, 
but in so muche as p e lawes 
bien fulfilled þerby. 
Pe þridde, 
it is declared how iusticia is distyngwed fram 
o p e r e vertues for other vertues 
makeþ a man parfit in hymself; 
and iusticia, 
wher it be legalis 
o p e r distributiua 
o p e r commutatiua, 
makeþ a man parfit in ordre to o p e r e . Chapter XI 
Hit was seid in p e nexte chapitre 
byfore p a t p e r is twey maner of iusticia, 
oon general | and anofcer special. 
Sif règnes schal stonde siker- f. liehe and dure in pees, 
eiper iusticia is nedful. 
Pat règnes may not dure withoute general iusticia, 
we may preue by twey weyes. 
Pe first is itake by iusticia, 
and p e secunde by p e regne 
in suche iusticia 
in p e whiche is iholde. 
v Pe firste wey is declared in þis wise: 
for it is seide in þe nexte chapitre 
tofore þat iusticia legalis 
is in som wise iche vertue 
and he þat hath suche iusticia 
fulfillefc þe lawe. 
Panne gif þe lawe commaundeth al good and forbedeth al euel and folfillefc þe lawe 
is to be p[ar]fitliche vertuous, 
þerfore, primo Magnorum Moralium, 
capitulo De Iusticia, 
it is seid þat iusticia legalis 
is a parfit vertue. 
Panne by þe contrarie iniusticia legalis 
is fol and hool malice. 
Panne he þat holdeþ not 
in non wise lawes and citeseyns 
þat hauen no part of iusticia legalis 
bien iholde iuel atte þe folle. 
But as it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
capitulo De Mansuetudine, 
þat euel destroyeth itselffceyit be fol and hool. 
Panne þat regne mygte not be soffred noþer 
þat cite mygte not dure gif þe cyteseyns þerof were alle yuel and wolde nougt holde þe lawe 
noþer wold haue part 
in no wise of iusticia legalis. 
By þe selue iusticia legalis 
þat is a parfit vertue 
and contrarie to malice, 
it may be preued 
þat withoute iusticia legalis 
may nougt règnes stonde. 
Pe seconde for to declare þat same may be take 
by þe selue regne, 
for euerich regne and eueriche polecie 
is acerteyne ordre 
and a certeyn principate. 
Panne for an ordre and a principate 
is bytwene sugettes and lawes 
and þe prince 
þat euefc þe lawes, 
as it is declared in Poli[t]icis, gif citeseyns hauen no part in iusticia legalis, 
among hem nys none ordre to lawes noþer to prince. 
Panne among hem is no polecie ikept noþer regne noþer kyngdom dureth lenger among hem. 
Panne it is ligt to declare 
þat withoute iusticia legalis | 
may nougt règnes and kyng- col. domes dure. 
And þat withoute iusticia specialis, 
þat is dyuydid in iusticia comutatiua and distributiua, 
may not kyngdomes dure, 
it may be declared in fcis wise: 
for euerich regne and eueriche congregacioun and gaderinge 
is ilikned to a certeyn kynde body. 
For as we seeþ þat in þe body of a beest bien diuerce membris and lemes ioned and iordeyned togedres, 
so in eueriche regne 
and in euery congregacioun ben diuers persones ioned and ordeyned 
to som thyng þat is on. 
Pan to speke by [l]eknes, 
in þe membres of þe same body 
is in som wise double iusticia 
commuta tiua and distributiua. 
And proprelich for to speke of iusticia: 
iusticia is not but in ordre to ofcer 
and is not but bytwene diuers persones; 
noþeles by a maner liknes iusticia 
is in ordre of þe same thing to itself, 
and in þe membris of þe same body we may in som wise se and knowe iusticia. 
For þe membris of þe same body 
hauen ordre eche to oþer 
and bien iordeyned to oon certeyn membre 
as to þe herte, 
of þe whiche he fongeth meuyng and influens of lif. 
Panne as þe membris hauen ordre eueriche to oþer, 
in hem is in som wise iusticia commutatiua; 
but as þei bien ordeyned to þe herte, 
in hem is in som wise iusticia distributiua. 
Iusticia commutatiua 
is among þynges 
for oon hath inow of som thing and anofcer lackeþ 
þerof and faileþ 
in som ofcer þyng 
of þe whiche anoþer hath inow. 
Perfore for eueriche man schulde releue hymself at nede, 
iusticia commutatiua is ifounde; 
for it happeth p a t som man hath moche money 
and anojser noon 
and it happeþ p a t he p a t hath moche moneye 
hath non whete 
and he p a t hath no moneye 
hath moche whete. 
Panne by iusticia commutatiua 
and by chaungyng suche passynge 
píente and defaute bien imade euene, 
for he p a t hath money ynowe 
z e u e p money and fongeþ whete p a t hy[m] nedeth 
and p a t o p e r eueth whete p a t | [he] hath in gret píente and fongeth money 
p a t hym f. lacketh. 
Panne iusticia commutatiua 
is whan oon ordeyneth his good and catel 
to help and profite of o p e r e and aenward. 
And pis manere doyng we fynden in p e membris of p e same body, 
for p e eye is cleer and scharpe of sit 
and hath no potencial vertue of goyng, 
for þe e y g e may not go; 
and p e foot may goo 
and lackeþ sit for þe foot may not see. 
Panne þe e y g e helpeth and reuleth 
p e foot by sigt, 
for p e eye reuleth p e foot 
and by potencial vertue of goynge 
p e foot helpeth p e eye, 
for p e foot bereth forp the eye. 
Panne but p e membres helpe so eche oþer 
as but p 
e honde clanse 
þe eie and p e eie reule 
p e hond and but p 
e fote bere forþ 
þe heed and but p e heed rulede p e foot, 
kynde body myt not stonde and dure. 
So for no man is sufficient to hymself to lyue, 
but citeseyns by iusticia commutatiua halpe eueriche o p e r 
e as but it were so 
p a t oon conneth to oþer thyng 
þat he hath in píente and fongeþ þyng p a t hym lacketh, 
p e cite myt not stonde and dure. 
Panne in p e membris of p e same body, 
as p e i hauen ordre 
to hemself and eche to o p e r 
e and helped ech o p e r , 
in hem is commutatiua prudencia 
oþer iusticia 
withoute p 
e whiche kynde body may not dure. 
So for citeseyns of p 
e same cite o p e r of p e same regne hauen ordre ech to o p e r and helpeth ech o p e r 
by certeyn commutacion and chaungyng of kynges, 
in hem is commutatiua iusticia 
wiþoute p 
e whiche noþer citee 
ne regne may stonde. 
Pe seconde, 
in membris is distributiua iusticia 
in p a t he hath ordre to p e herte. 
‡For by here proporcioun and dignité 
p e herte eueth to alle p 
e membris spirit of leuyng and meuyng. 
So p a t p e principal and welle of lif and of meuyng 
is in p e h e r t e as in caas p e welle of felyng is in p e brayn. 
And | so in cyteseyns 
is iusticia distributiua in p a t p e i ben col. 
ordeyned to a certeyn on 
as to p e kyng or to p e duk p a t schal, 
as p e i bien vertues and worthi, 
eue ham and dele 
among hem worschep and iftes 
and good and catel. 
Panne as a kynde body 
may not stonde and dure but if p e r be in<ne> som iusticia distributiua as p a t 
p e h e r t e eue to p e membris in p e w manere vertues and spirit of lif and meuyng, 
so no regne noþer cite may stonde and dure 
but gerinne be iusticia distributiua so p a t p e kyng o p e r p e duk eue and dele worschep and good and catel in p e w manere. 
But it is bysiliche to wytynge 
p a t 
as not ech inequalite bynemeth 
p e lif of kynde body, 
but eche inequalite is cause of sekenesse 
and of euel r þerinne, 
so not euerich iniusticia corumpeth and destroyeth holliche pe regne and polici; 
but by ech iniusticia, wrong, 
þe regne and polici 
is apeyred and disposed to corupcioun and be destroyed. 
And so it is declared p a t 
as citeseyns hauen ordre ech to oper, 
in hem is iusticia commutatiua; 
and as þei hauen ordre to kyng oper to prince, 
in hem is iusticia distributiua; 
and in p a t he willed þe lawe, 
in hem is iusticia legalis. 
But how ech iusticia be take, 
þerwithoute no regne noþer citee may stonde. 
P anne it is wel iseid, 
primo Magnorum Moralium, 
capitulo De Iusticia, 
p a t ‡iuste 
is a certeyn preporcional and conteyneth townes, 
and [as pe soule conteynep pe body, 
f o r p e r w i p 
o u t e pe body is d i s s o l u e d 
a n d s c h r y n k e p , 
so i u s t i c 
i a conteynep townes, 
p a t is] citées and regnes, 
for þerwiþoute no cite ne regne may stonde. 
Panne he p a t holdeþ not iusticia 
don greet wrong hope 
to pe regne and to pe kyng. 
Panne gif iusticia 
is so good to pe regne and to pe kyng, 
pe kyng schal with most besinesse Studie and do p 
a t iusticia be kept and iholde in his regne, 
and not oonliche to hem p 
a t bien ibore in pe regne 
but also to pilgrymes, 
to alyenes and to straungers; 
for who p a t euere | 
f. is werned iusticia, 
open wrong is ido 
to pe kyng and to pe regne. Chapter XII 
By pe nexte chapitre tofore, 
it is declared cleer inow þat kynges and princes schulde be rigtful and iuste 
and pey schulde kepe 
and holde rigtwisnesse and iusticia 
for þerwithoute no regne 
ne citee may stonde. 
But for mannes wit is gentil and noble and desireth alwey 
to hire newe resouns, 
we schulle brynge forþ newe maners 
by pe whiche it may be declared 
þat it is most semelich 
p a t kynges and princes be rigtful and iuste. 
And we may declare p i s soþnesse and trouthe 
by ‡foure weyes, 
by pe foure p a t bien itouched de iusticia in v Ethicorum. 
Pe firste wey is itake 
by pe persone of pe kyng; 
pe seconde, 
by pe selue iusticia; 
pe þridde, 
by pe parfite goodnesse 
þat cometh of iusticia; 
and pe ferþe, 
by pe malice 
p a t cometh of iniusticia, wrong. 
P e firste wey is declared in p i s wise: 
gif pe lawe is reule of actus and dedes, 
as it is iseid in v Ethicorum, 
pe i u g e and namliche pe kyng 
p a t geueth pe l a w e schulde be a certeyn rule 
in actus and dedis. 
For a kyng oþere a prince is a certeyne lawe and pe lawe 
is a certeyne kyng oþer a prince. 
For þe lawe is pe certeyn <vn>soule<d> prince 
and þe prince is a certeyn souled lawe; 
þanne in as moche as þe souled þyng passed pe <vn>sawle<d> þyng, 
in so moche a kyng o p e r 
e a prince schulde passe pe lawe. 
For a kyng oþer a prince schulde be rigtful and iust and haue so gret iusticia and equite 
þat he mygte rule pe lawe gif per fille a certeyn caas 
in þe whiche pe lawe schulde not be holde as it schal be declared inneremore. 
P anne to axe a doute gif pe kyng schulde haue equite, 
euennes and be iust, 
it is to axe a doute gif pe reule schulde be ┌ ┐ v reuled; 
for gif þe | reule be not euene, 
no thing is reuled, 
for al þyng þat col. is reuled 
is ireuled by þe reule. 
So gif kynges be not iuste 
þey desposen þe regne 
þat iusticia 
be not ikept and iholde þerinne. 
Panne kynges schul most studie to be iuste 
and do equite for here iniusticia and vnequite 
bynemeth hem maieste and dignité of kynges. 
For kynges þat bieth not iuste, 
þeig þat þei be lordes 
by cyuyle mygt and strengfce, 
gut þei bien not worthi to be kynges; 
for it is semelich 
þat þe rule be rigt and euene. 
And for a kyng 
is a manere sauled lawe 
and a manere souled reule of actus and dedes, 
it is most semelich 
touchyng his awne persone 
þat he kepe and holde iusticia. 
Pe secounde, 
we may declare þe same 
by þe silue iusticia, 
for iusticia is ful good and noble; 
as it is iseyd, 
it makefc man parfit in ordre to oþer. 
And oure godenesse is most iknow 
whan it strechefc to oþer, 
and so it is iseid in v Ethicorum 
þat iusticia 
is acounted most passyng clere vertue. 
And so it is iseid 
þat not Vesperus noþer Lucifer 
is so brigt as iusticia. 
Vesperus and Lucifer 
is al on sterre 
and is ful fair and brigt 
and is comonliche cleped Venus 
for fairenesse þerof; 
for Venus is a planet 
and som tyme þis sterre goþ 
before þe sonne 
and is þanne iseyge erlich 
in þe dawenyng 
and is þanne icleped Lucifer 
þe day sterre. 
And þe same sterre cometh som tyme after þe sonne 
and is iseye 
in þe eue tyde 
and is fcanne icleped Vesperus þe eue sterre. 
Panne þe philosofre wol mené þat seþþe þat Venus, 
þat is so faire a sterre 
and is som tyme icleped Lucifer, 
þe day sterre ‡, 
and som tyme Vesperus, 
þe eue sterre, 
is not so faire and so brigt as iusticia, 
þe fairenesse of sterres 
is not so wonderful 
as þe fairenesse of iusticia. 
Pe sterres passeth in bodilich fairenesse 
and byschyneth vs with bodilich ligt, 
but iusticia passeth 
in honest fairenesse and spiritual and ligteth vs 
with vertual perfec|cioun. f. Panne a[s] spiritual feirnesse passeth bodylich fairenesse, 
so þe fairenesse of iusticia and clernesse 
þerof is more wonderful 
þan clernesse of sterres. 
Panne gif it is semelich 
þat kynges and princes 
haue most cleere vertues by iusticia 
þat is most cleer vertue, 
it may be preued 
þat it is semelich ‡ 
þat kynges and princes kepe and holde iusticia. 
Pe þridde, 
þe same may be preued 
by parfit goodnesse 
þat is iknowe and cometh of iusticia; 
for iusticia is not onliche parfit vertue in itsilf, 
but [gif] it is in kynges and princes, 
þey schevven þat þei bien parfite and good. 
For as we seefc in oþere þynges 
þat euerich þyng is parfit 
whan it may gendre 
and brede forþ thyng ileche to itself, 
and whanne his worchyng 
and doyng streccheþ to oþere þynges, 
as a þyng is parfitlich hote 
whan it may hete oþere þynges; 
and whanne worchynge 
and doyng þerof streccheth to oþere, 
and a man is parfitliche connynge 
whanne he may teche oþere, 
and whanne his connynge streccheth to oþere: 
þerfore it is iwrete, primo Methaphisicorum, 
þat þe parfite tokene 
of a connyng man 
is 
þat he may teche; 
þanne in þe same wise, 
þanne a r The Governance of K i n g s a n d P 
r i n c e s man is parfitlich good 
whanne his goodnesse streccheth to oþere. 
Perfore it is p 
a t mannes parfit goodnesse 
is not iknowe 
but he be iset 
in som manere principate, 
for while a man hath to reulynge but hymself, 
it is not iknowe 
atte pe ful wheþer he is good 
oþer euel noþer his goodnesse 
is parfitliche iknowe. 
But whan he is iset in som principate, 
for his goodnesse mot strecche to o p e r e , þanne it is better iknowe whiche he is 
for his workes and dedes streccheth to o p e r e . 
Panne for outward thynges 
bien most iknowe to vs, 
in pe grettre principate 
a man is iset, 
pe bettere it is iknowe whiche he is, 
for his workes and dedes | col. streccheth to mo thinges. 
Perfore it is seid 
in v Ethicorum 
p a t principate scheweth whiche a man is. 
Perfore it is iseide 
in a prouerbe gif a man wol knowe whiche anoþer man is, 
sette hym in sum principate. 
By iusticia p a t is in ordre to oþere parfite goodnesse is iknow. 
For outtake prudencia, 
þat is more parfite 
þan oþere vertues, 
for it reuleþ 
alle o þ e r e vertues morale, 
alle oþere vertues morale 
pat maketh man parfit in hymself haueþ 
a manere ordre to iusticia 
þat makeþ a man parfit 
in ordre to o p e r e , 
as sogettes p a t in som wise reuleth 
onlich hemself 
hauen ordre to þe prince 
whos goodnes 
and rewlyng streccheþ to oþere. 
Panne as in a prince parfite goodnes 
is more iknowe p a n in olpere men, so by iusticia parfite godenesse is more iknowe 
p a n by oper vertues moral. 
Pan it is semelich 
p a t kynges and princes scholde be iuste for þei scho[l]de be ‡ reule of werkes and dedes 
and also for iusticia 
is a passyng cler vertue 
and also for þerby parfit goodnesse is iknowe. 
Pe ferpe, 
p a l is semelich to kynges and princes of greet malice 
þat cometh of iniusticia, wrong ‡. 
For as it is iseide in v Ethicorum, 
as he is bettere þat is not oonlich good in hymsilf 
but his goodnesse streccheth also to oþere, 
so he is worse þat is not onlich euel in hemself, 
but also his malis streccheþ to oper; 
and to pe mo his malis streccheþ 
pe wors he is p a n we. 
So moche pe more besynesse kynges and princes schal Studie to kepe 
and holde iusticia 
and voyde iniusticia, wrong, 
pe more euel and harme may come 
of here iniusticia, wrong, 
and mo men may be greued þerwyþ. 
It were forþeremore 
to declaryng how kynges and princes may wynne and gete iusticia 
and how he schal kepe and holde iusticia; 
but p a t schal be playnlich declared in pe þridde book 
þere it is declared how a regne schal 
be iustliche and rigtfulliche ireuled. | f. v Chapter XIII 
In alle bynge in þc which it happeth to do euel and wel, 
it nedeth to geue som vertue 
by pe whiche we may be reuled in actus and dedes; 
and for in drede 
and in hardinesse 
it happeth a man to haue hymself wel and euel, 
it nedeth to geue 
som vertue in drede 
and in hardinesse. 
For it happeth þat som men dredeþ 
p a t is to dredyng and somme dredeþ 
f?at it is not to dredynge, 
for som bien so ferful and coward 
p a t p e i dredenMaysp 
a t rennen aboute 
and som ben so fole hardy p a t þei Dresden not God 
and p a t is not fortitudo, 
but it is wodenes. 
Perfore it is iwrete, 
primo Magnorum Moralium, 
ho p a t is so neuere aferd 
p a t he dredeþ not God, 
he is not fortis but wood. 
Panne to hym p a t is fortis it longeth to drede 
what is to drede 
and be hardy 
whan he schulde be hardy. 
Panne fortitudo is a vertue p a t abateþ drede and moderate]? hardynesse, 
for fortitudo abateth drede pat man withdrawe hym not fro þyng 
p a t reson axeth, 
and moderateth hardinesse p a t man 
be not hardy to auentre vpon thing 
p a t is agenst resoun. 
For it is declared what is fortitudo, 
it is to wetyng 
in what mater suche a vertue stonde]?. 
Perfore it is to wetynge p a t properliche for to speke, 
drede and hardinesse stondeþ in periles; 
for no man dredeþ 
but he wene p a t som peril is hym toward, 
n o p e r is hardy 
but he auntre 
on som thyng p 
a t is dredful and perelous. 
And som peril is in werre and bataille 
and somme cometh of o p e r e causes; 
for we bien in peril 
not onlich in werre and bataille, 
but also in p e see and in seknesse, 
and in o p e r 
e in p 
e which happeth perilles. 
Also in periles 
þat falleth in werre 
and in bataille 
men hauen hemself diuersliche, 
for som dreden and som bien hardy; 
and hardy | men bien diuerse for som auntreth hemself ligtliche to periles of col. bataile, 
but after p e auentryng 
and p e rees pey abiden 
not but taketh to fligt and fleeth awey. 
And somme auentreth not ligtliche 
in to peril of p e batel; 
[but after p e auentryng and p e rees] 
p e i abiden and fleen not p e peril of batel. 
Panne for a vertue stonde]? 
in good p a t is w i p difficulté 
(for periles of werre and bataille 
bien more dredful 
and with more difficulté þanne 
o p e r e periles, 
and also for in periles of werre and of bataille 
is more difficulté to abate drede p a n it is to moderate hardynesse, 
also for in dede of hardinesse 
is not so greet difficulté to auentre 
and to rese in to figtynge 
as it is to abide and figte), fortitudo, 
p a t is a vertue 
p a t stondeþ in peryles, 
stant more principalliche in peril of werre and bataille 
]?an in o p e r e pereles, 
and stondeþ more principaliche 
in abatynge of drede 
p a t happeth 
in suche periles þanne in moderatynge of hardines 
þat happeth þerinne. 
And also suche a vertue stondeþ more principaliche in abidyng and figtyng p 
a n in auentryng and in rysyng. 
And pat it is more difficulté to abide 
in perel of werre and of batelle þan in o p 
e r e periles 
may be declared by p r e weyes. First, 
for suche periles bien more iknowe and more ifeled p 
a n o p e r e periles. 
For we knowen not dep so cleer whan we bien seek, 
for seknesse is ihid withinne, 
noþer we feleþ perel of p 
e see as we d o p perel of werre and of batel, 
no]?er we feleth sore hertynge of touche of p e water 
as we d o p of touch of þe swerd. 
Panne for peril of werre and of bataille 
is openliche iknowe, 
and also for it is most ifeled, 
and also we ymageneth and dredeþ 
most sore harm and hurtynge in suche perel, 
it is | more difficulte and f. 
more hard to abyde suche periles 
p a n othere periles. 
r Pe seconde, 
it is more hard and difficulté to abyde in suche periles 
p a n in oþere periles not onlich for þey 
ben more openliche iknowe 
and more greuous hurtyng 
and sore cometh þerof, 
but also we ymageneth and hopeþ 
to voyde and askape suche periles 
ligtlich by with drawyng and flight. 
And we may not so voide and fle seknesse. 
For sekenesse iswithinne vsself, 
we may not voyde 
ne flee seknesse. 
Noþer we may voyde 
ne flee peril of p e see, 
as we may voyde p e peril of werre and bataille. 
Pan for it is more difficulte 
to abide peril 
p a t we may flee and voyde 
p a n peril þat we mot nedes abyde, 
for we may not hem voide and flee, 
here is more difficulté to abide perel of batel 
þan perels of opere. 
Pe þridde, 
it is more difficulte to abide suche peril 
for þerby we taketh most violent deeþ, 
for deep in bataille 
is by maymynge of membris 
and by sore strokes, 
wondes and keruyng of p e body 
by p e whiche we taken most violent deep. 
And dep pat cometh 
by som seeknesse 
o þ e r e by som o p e r e manere, 
semeth not so contrarie 
to kynde of p e body as dep of werre and in bataille 
by p e whiche p e body is hakked, 
iwonded and icorue. 
Panne p e vertue fortitudo ‡ stondeþ principallich in peril of werre and of bataille, 
and by p e consequent and folwyng in oþere periles. 
Perfore it is iseid, 
in iii Ethicorum, 
þat principalliche he is cleped fortis, 
þat is withoute drede 
in good deep of werre and in bataille. 
But git in p e see and in sekenesse 
he pat is fortis dredeth nougt. 
It longeth to hym 
þat is fortis to drede no peril pat resoun wol pat it is nougt to | col. dredynge. 
But p e most principaliche fortitudo stondeþ 
in peril of werre and of batel 
as in most hard perel 
and with most difficulté. 
Forþermore þey fortitudo stonde 
in dedes and in perelles of werre and of bataille 
abatyng drede and moderating 
(pat is ‡[naschyng]) [hardynesse] þerinne, 
git it stondeþ 
more principalliche 
in abatyng of drede þanne 
in moderatyng of hardynesse. 
For dredfol perels ben comonliche sorweful, 
and eche man kyndeliche fleeþ 
and voideth thing sorweful, 
as eche man desireth kyndeliche to haue þyng 
p a t is likyng. 
Panne for kyndelich we fleen þyng p a t is sorweful, 
it is hard to abate drede by p 
e whiche we flee thing 
þat is sorweful, 
and is not so hard to moderate hardynesse by p 
e whiche we auentreth and reiseth on þyng p 
a t is soroufol. 
Perfore gif a vertue stonde principalliche in þyng pat 
is hard with difficultee, 
it is wel iseid 
þat fortitudo stondeþ principalliche more in abatyng of drede þan in moderatyng of hardinesse. 
And þat fortitudo stondeþ more principalliche 
in abidyng and soffryng þan 
in auntryng and resyng, 
as it is comonliche iseide, 
may by p r e weyes be declared. First, 
for auntryng and resyng longeb to p 
e strenger and bydyng and soffryng to p e feblere; 
for he þat reseth is likned to oþere as to p 
e more feble, 
but he p a t abideth and soffreth as to p 
e more strong. 
But it is more difficulté to withstonde p 
e more strong þan p e more feble. 
Perfore it is more difficulté 
to abyde and soffry figtynge 
þan it is to rese and falle onfigtyngemen. 
Pe secunde, 
þat is more difficulté 
for he þat reseth and ymagineth to euel and harm haþe euel and harme | 
as it were to comyng, 
but he þat f. soffreth hath euel 
and harme present 
tofore his eygen. 
And it is more difficulté to a man 
withstonde and bere hym wel 
and stalworthliche agens his euel and harme 
þat is present 
þan agenst euel and harme 
þat is to comynge. 
Pe þridde, 
þat is more difficulté 
for resyng 
may be do sodeynliche, 
but abydyng and suffryng requireth 
and axeth duryng of tyme. 
Panne gif it is more difficulté to a man 
to bere hym wel 
and stedefastliche in abidyng and soffryng batel þat axeth duryng of tyme, 
þanne in resyng þerto þat may sodeynliche be do, 
þerfore, iii Ethicorum, capitulo De Fortitudine, 
þe philosofre seith 
þat fortitudo stondeþ 
in drede and in hardinesse; 
but it stondeth more in abatyng of drede 
þan in moderatynge of hardinesse 
and seith þerto 
þat fortitudo stondeþ 
in abidyng and suffraunce of sorweful thinges; 
and so it is declared 
where inne fortitudo stondeþ. 
Panne it is to declarynge 
how we may make vsself fortes. 
Perfore it is to wetyng 
þat þei a vertue be contrarie 
to tweyne malice of þe whiche þat oon passeth 
and þat oþer faylleþ, 
as largitas 
(þat is largenesse) 
is contrarie to prodegalitas 
(þat is myspendyng) 
þat passeth in spendyng, 
and to scarsenesse 
and to chinchery in spendyng; 
and fortitudo is contrarie to audacia 
(þat is hardenesse) 
þat passeth in auntryng 
and in resyng, 
and to timi[d]itas, 
ferfolnesse þat faillefc; 
but alwey a vertue 
is more contrarie to þe oo malice þan to þe oþere. 
As it is more difficulte to abate drede þan to moderate hardinesse, 
fortitudo stondeþ 
more in abatyng of drede þan in moderatyng | of hardinesse. 
And drede is col. 
more contrarie to fortitudo þa[n] is hardynesse. 
Also for we may not fynde euene mené 
and myddel betwene hardynesse and drede, 
we schul rafcer drawe 
to hardinesse 
þan to drede, 
for hardinesse is lasse contrarie to fortitudo 
þan is drede, 
þerfore we schulde raþer 
and more decline and drawe to hardynesse 
þan to drede 
gif we wolde make vsself fortes. 
And so thilke þre bien declared 
þat we rekened 
in þe bygynnyng of þis chapitre, 
for it is declared what is fortitudo; 
for it is a vertue 
þat abateþ drede and moderateth hardynesse. 
Also it is declared where inne fortitudo stondeþ, 
for it stondeþ principalliche in perels of werre and of batail 
and in abatyng of drede 
and in abydyng and sosteyne figtyng; 
and by þe consequent folwyng it stondeth 
in oþere periles also, 
and in moderatyng of hardinesse 
and in auntryng and resyng on figtyng men. 
Pe fcridde, 
it is declared how we may make vsself fortes, 
for þat we doþ in drawyng most 
to hardinesse þan to drede, 
for hardinesse is not so contrarie to fortitudo 
as is drede. 
v The G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d Punces Chapter XIV The philosofre, iii Ethicorum, capitulo De Fortitudine, 
distingwith seuene maneres of fortitudo. 
Pe firste is fortitudo ciuiles; 
p e secounde, seruilis; 
þe þridde, militaris; 
þe ferþe, furiosa; 
p e fifte, consuetudinalis; 
þe sexte, bestialis; 
þe seuenthe is vertuous fortitudo. 
Fortitudo ciuilis 
is whan a man dredeþ schame 
and wol gete worschep 
and auntreth perfore and reseth 
on som dredful þyng and dede. 
Perfore þe philosofre seith 
p a t in þis manere wise fortes 
ben acounted most fortes among men 
among þe whiche ferful men 
ben despised and fortes iworscheppede. | 
And as þe philosofer seith, 
in pis wise Ector f. was fortus, 
for he dradde to be despised of Polimadas 
and auntred perfore and resed 
on dredful dedes and seide 
p a t gif he fligh, Polymadas, 
p a t was in þe o p 
e r side his aduersarie, 
wolde hym blame and despise. 
Also as þe philosofer seith 
in þe same wise Dyomades was fortis, 
and seide but gif he dede mygtiliche and strongliche, 
Ector wolde preyse hymsilf 
among þe Troianes and seye 
p a t he hath ouercome Diomedes. 
And þis fortitudo 
is wel icleped fortitudo ciuilis, 
for among neighbores and men 
p a t knoweth hym a man fondeth most to voide velanye 
and despite and desireth to haue worschepe. 
For we seep som 
t?at d o p foule dedes 
whan p e i ben in strange contre and assaiej? 
no suche dedes among neighbores 
þat he knoweth. 
Pe secounde hatte seruylis 
and is worse 
p a n p e firste, 
as whan a man auntreth and reseth to figte, 
nought for to voide and flee velanye 
and schame noþer 
for to gete worschepe, 
but for drede of peyne oþer compelled 
by som maner nede. 
In þis wise many of p 
e Troians dradde Ector and were fortes for as p e filosofer seith Ector hadde iordeyned p 
a t gif eny of p 
e Troians flig withoute þe bataille, 
he schulde be so arayed p a t he schulde not be of mygt 
to dryue awey houndes. 
Dukes of ostes maken men strong 
in þis wise 
and ordeynen peyne to hym 
p a t fleen 
and maken dupe pittes and diches, 
for p e host schulde not flee awey 
but be compelled 
by som nécessite and nede to abide and to figte. 
It is iseid 
j?at in 
j?is cause on compelled his owne ost to abide and to figte 
and to be fortis. 
For whan | he was passed in schippes 
with al his ost col. 
and com alond, 
for non of his men schulde haue matier to flee out of his ost, 
he brake alie p e schippes echone. 
Pe þridde hatte fortitudo militaris, 
of knyghthood, 
and pis is fortitudo of assay 
þat þei hauen of werre and of batelle. 
Knygtes aventreth 
and d o p many dedes pat semeth perelous and dredful. 
For as Vegesius seith, 
in libro De Re Militari, 
no man douteth to assaye 
a þyng noþer dede p e whiche he troweth and tristeþ 
þat he hath wel ilerned. 
For we seeth p a t som men gif he hireth noise 
of rustlyng of armure 
he fleeth anoon and conneth not knowe 
what is perilous or not perilous in batel; 
but knygtes þat bien expert in batel tristeth in here 
awne experience 
r and knoweth perels of batels and reseth and auntreth on periles and dredful dedes 
for to be accountted and iholde fortes. 
But p e i bien not fortes properliche for to speke, 
for whan þe bateile is so strong 
p a t it passeth here experience a ‡turneth 
p e bak and f l e e p . 
Pe ferþe fortitudo hatte furiosa, wood, 
for by cause of woodnesse 
and of passioun 
som men aventreth som tyme in to strong figtynge 
so 
þat p e i ben [iuged fortes; 
but p e i ben] not fortes properliche 
for to speke for verrey fortitudo, 
as þe philosofer meneþ verrey fortitudo, 
auentreth to figtyng 
not for woodnesse 
but for goodnesse. 
And gif on p a t 
auentreth hym to figte for woodnesse, 
gif p e i fynden 
withstondyng and lette, 
þei abyde not to figte; 
for he þat is hardy imaad 
withoute drede by woodnesse, 
whan p e woodnesse is iseced, 
þanne he bygynneth to drede and abyde not in batel 
but taken hem to fligte. 
Pefigftefortitudo is consuetudinalis, 
for som men on cas | hauen wel f. ihapped in manye batailes and taketh 
perfore certeyn hope 
and trist of p e victorie 
by cause of suche customes 
and vsages and taketh 
also certeyn hardinesse and boldenesse 
to figte in batailles. 
Panne suche bien acounted fortes, 
for p e i auntreth hemsilf 
to figte in batailles 
and hauen hope 
and trist of p e victorie and troweth to haue noon harme; 
but þei bien not verrey fortes, 
for gif p e i fynden reestes 
and lette and hauen harm 
as þei trowen not, 
þ a n n e pei turnen pe bak and fleen. 
Pe sexte fortitudo hatte bestialis, 
as whan a man knoweth not p 
e strengthe of his aduersarie and fighteth 
as gif men 
p a t woneth in p 
e norþ bien strong, bolde, and hardy and men 
p a t wonen in þe south bien feble and ferful. 
Pan he p a t reseth to figte 
with northerne men and wenen p a t p e i bien southerne men - men 
p a t figten in þat wise hauen fortitudo of bestialis. 
For suche bien vnwise 
as beestes and auntreth in to bataille 
and knoweth not p e mygt and p e strengte of here aduersarie. 
Pe seuenþe hatte fortitudo virtuosa, 
as whanne a man 
is not for constreyned 
noþer for woodnesse 
noþer for experience and assay, 
noþer for vnwarnesse and vnkunnynge 
auentreth to figte in bataille, 
but for good and by his owne eleccioun and fre wille. 
And kynges and princes schulde knowe þes seuene maners of fortitudo p a t [pei] may beknowe 
in what wise here puple is fortis 
and how he may figte with here aduersarie in batel. 
But kynges and princes schulde be fortes 
in vertuous fortitudo 
pat p e i put not her puple 
to peril of werre and of bataille, 
but p e i haue rigtful werre and bataille 
and but þei knowe 
and se þat of suche a bataille 
may come greet profite 
to p e contrey 
and to p e regne. | col. v Chapter XV

p a t is pe wille. 
And vertues moral bien 
in pe appetite sensitif 
as in pe irascibile, 
p a t is wrethful, 
and in pe concupiscible, 
p a t is coueitnesse. 
For pe appetite se[n]citif 
is not so worthi 
as pe wille and pe inwit 
p a t hatte intellectus. 
Perfore prudencia 
and iusticia bien most principal vertues. 
And prudencia is more principal 
p a n iusticia, 
for prudencia reuleth alle o p e r e vertues. 
Alþei fortitudo and temporancia 
be not principal 
as prudencia and iusticia, 
git p e i bien accounted among principal vertues. 
For vertues p a t moderateþ passionis serueþ resoun in double maner wise, 
as passions ben agenst resoun in double manere wise; 
for passiouns ben agenst resun 
for pey drawyn vs to do agenst resun, oper, 
as it is seyd tofore, 
for he drawyth vs fro dedis p a t resoun a x i p . 
Amonge þingis p a t wiþ drawin vs fro resonable dedes 
is d[r]ede of bateille and periles of deep a 
n d þerin stondeþ fortitudo, 
p a t is strengte. 
Among kynges p a t draweth vs to do agenst reson ‡is seruice of Venus, 
p a t is lecherie 
and lekyng of tast, 
and gerinne stonde}) tempor ancia. 
Panne fortitudo and temporancia bien accounted among principal vertues. 
And fortitudo is more principal p a n temporancia, 
for fortitudo is more iordeyned 
to defense of pe regne 
and to sauacioun of pe contrey. 
And temporancia is more iordeyned to singuler and proper profit 
as to moderacioun of man hymself, 
and comyn profit is more worthi p a n singuler and proper profit. 
Panne after p a t we haue spoke of prudencia 
p a t is more principal 
p a n is iusti|cia, 
and of iusticia 
p a t is more principal 
p a n fortitudo, 
and of f. fortitudo 
p a t is more principal 
p a n temporancia, 
now it is to spekyng of temporancia 
p a t is pe laste amonge pe principal vertues. 
Panne it is to wetyng 
p a t as fortitudo is mene bytwene drede and hardinesse, 
for he p a t dredeþ al thing is not fortis noþer he p a t dredeþ no thing, 
but he þat dredeþ 
what is to dredyng 
and is bold and hardy in thinges 
p a t he schulde be bold and hardy inne, 
so temporancia is mené bitwene delectacioun and insencibilite. 
And we clepede hym insencibilis, 
agrestis also p 
a t forsaketh 
and fleeth 
alle bodilich delectacioun and likyng. 
Panne insencibilitas 
is forsake and fleeth sencible delectacioun and likynge more 
p a n reson axeth. 
Panne he p a t folweth alle delectacioun 
and likynge is intemporatus 
and he p a t forsaketh and fleeth al delectación and likynge is icleped insencibilis and agrestis also. 
Panne he p a tfleethp 
a t is to fleyng and folweth p a t is to folwyng is temporatus; 
for it happeth som tyme to do amys not onliche folwynge sencible delectacioun, 
p a t is felyng délit and likyng, 
but also forsakyng 
and r fleyng 
suche delectacioun and likyng. 
For who þat wolde so absteyne and spare mete and drynke 
and oþer sencible delectación and likynge 
þat is kynde myte not endure 
with suche abstinens, 
for suche abstine[n]s is agenst resoun; 
suche oon mygte nougt be cleped vertuous. 
And so it is declared what is temporancia; 
for as fortitudo abateth drede and moderateth 
(þat is naschyng) hardynesse, 
and is bytwene drede and hardinesse, 
so temporancia abateth sensible delectacioun and likynge and moderateth insencibilite 
and is hem bytwene. 
Panne for temporancia abateth 
sencible delectacioun of likynge, 
it is to wetynge | 
in what sencible delectacioun and likyng stondefc [tern- col. poranlcia. 
For som sencible delectacioun and likyng is strong 
and som feble 
and som draweth and meueth vs more and some lasse. 
Pei þer be fif wittes, 
git we hauen strengere likynge in tast and in touching þan in sigte, huryng and smellyng. 
And þat is declared in tweye manere wise. First, 
for þe more we bien ioned to likynge 
þe more feruent likyng we hauen þerinne. 
And we ben more ioned and nerere to þe likynge 
þat we hauen in tast 
and in touching [þan] to þe likynge 
þat we hauen in oþere wittes. 
For we may hire, 
se and smelle thinges 
þat bien fer from vs, 
but we may not taste and touche but thinges 
þat bien iiuned to vs. 
Perfore in suche sencible delectacioun we hauen 
þe more feruent likyng. 
Pe seconde, þe same is declared, 
for sencible delectacioun in tast 
and in touching semeth iordeyned more strayt and inmediate, 
þat is sone after, 
to oure kepyng and sauacioun. 
To delectacioun in tast 
is ordeyned to kepe and saue þe singuler persone, 
% but delectacioun in touching 
as in matrimone 
is ordeyned to kepe, 
to saue, general and special kynde. 
Perfore in caas kynde settefc 
so grete likynge in delectacioun in tast and in touchyng for syngularite of persones schulde not periche 
and for special kynde schulde be kepte and isaued. 
And so for a vertue stondefc 
in good and with difficulté, 
temporancia stondefc in fcilke delectacioun 
fro þe whiche it is hard and difficulté to absteyne. 
Panne temporancia stondefc principalliche 
in delectacioun of oþere wittes, 
þat is so principalliche 
for som tyme it happeth 
þat wit perseyueth thing 
þat is good and likynge in tast and in touching. 
And þe philosofer) wolde, iii Ethicorum, 
suche a vertue stondefc 
in delectacioun f. 
and likynge in þe whiche 
oþere bestes communeth, 
and oþere bestes hauen likynge principalliche in taste 
and in toching 
and al principalliche in oþere wittes. Perfore, iii Ethicorum, 
it is iseid 
þat houndes hauen no ioye of þe smel of þe hare, 
but on þe mete; 
and gif þei hauen ioie of þe smel of þe hare, 
þat is for he troweth and hopeth to ete þerof. 
And þe leoun hath no ioie of þe voice of þe oxe noþer of þe sigt of þe hert, 
but in so moche 
as by sight and huyryng þey [knoweth] 
þat þei ben neighe 
and troweth and hopeth to ete fcerof. 
v Panne temporancia stondeth 
in delectacioun of tast and of touching, 
but it stondeþ most principalliche 
in delectacioun of touchynge 
for gerinne men hauen most feruent likyng. 
And þat semeth resonable, for delectacioun of mete and of dryngke 
þat is in tast is ordeyned to kepe and to saue singuler and proper persone; 
but delectacioun of matrymoyne 
þat is in touching 
is ordeyned to getyng and gendryng of children 
and to kepe and to saue special kynde. 
Panne for as it is ofte seide comyn good and profit 
is bettre þan singuler good and profit, 
it semeth þat kynde 
d o p resonablelich to sette in workes and dedes of matrimonye more strong delectacioun þa[n] in workes 
and in dedes of norschyng and of fedyng. 
O p e r in caas kynde d o p so, 
for eueriche man is more diligent and besy 
for his owne good and profit 
þan for good and profit of o p e r e , 
þanne it nedeth not to sette so strong delectacioun and likyng in mete and in drynke 
þat is ordeyned to singuler good and profit 
and to kepe and saue p 
e synguler person 
as it nedeþ to sette matrimoyne p a t is ordeyned to good and profit 
to o p e r e 
and kepe and saue special kynde. 
Pan for we schuld most figt agenst most hard difficulté, J Jeanne | col. 
most we schul more byseye by temporancia 
to refrayne delectacioun of Venus, 
p a t is lecherie, 
p a t is in touching, 
p a n delectacioun of mete and drynke, 
pat is in taast. 
And gut, 
in delectacioun of mete and drynke 
we haue more lekyng in touchyng 
p a n in tast; 
for in etynge and drynkynge, 
as eche knoweth in hymself, 
we haue likyng in þe tonge 
in þe whiche is þe tast 
and in þe taróte in p 
e whiche is no tast but touchyng. 
And as we knowe oponliche, we haueth more lekynge 
whan mete or drynke toucheth þe Juróte 
j}an whanne it towcheth þe tonge. 
In suche matier þe menyng of glotouns 
is to trowyng and, 
iii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer reherseth and speketh of on p 
a t heet Philosonus p a t was so gret glotoun p 
a t he prayede p 
a t his þrote schulde 
be lengere þan p 
e þrote of a crane; 
and prayde not p 
a t his tonge schulde be braddere þanne an oxe tonge, 
þat aughte haue more likynge in tast, 
but he preyde p 
a t his þrote schulde and most be more long p a n a þrote of a crane p a t he myte in etyng and drynkyng haue p 
e lengere tyme likyng in touche. 
And so by þat is iseid, 
it is declared, 
pat temporancia stondeþ principallich in touche 
and not so principallich in tast and git lasse principalliche in olpere wittes. 
And we may ligtlyche take diuers maneres of temporancia, 
for it longeth to temporancia 
to refrayne delectacioun and likyng p 
a t we hauen in mete and drynke 
and in dedes of lecherie; 
for we abateth and refrayneth delectacioun in mete and drynke gif we absteyne and ben sobre, 
and we absteyne delectacioun in lecherie gif we ben chast and pudik. 
Panne p e r is foure manere of temporancia: sobrietas, abstinencia, castitas and pudicitia. 
For gif we wolleth refrayne delectacioun of mete and drynke, 
we | mote make vsself temporate 
in mete and drynke. 
He f. þat makeþ hymself temporate 
in drynke is sobrius, 
as he þat passeth in drynke is ebrius, 
and he p a t is temporate 
in mete is abstinens. 
And so abstinencia and sobrietas serueth to abate delectacioun 
in mete and drynke; 
but castitas and pudicitia refrayneth delectacioun 
and likyng of lecherie. 
For he þat is verray temporate mote spare workes 
and dedes of lecherie 
and of tast 
and he þat spareth dedes of lecherie 
is icleped castus, chaaste; 
and gif he refrayneth þe passions 
p a t exciteþ 
and meueth to lecherie, 
he is cleped honestus and pudicus also. 
In pes weies it may be sone iknowe 
in what wise we may make vs temporate, 
for fortitudo and temporancia ben 
as it were ageward 
metyng eiper to oþer; 
for fortitudo stondeþ 
in auenturyng on dredful dedes, 
but temporancia stondeþ 
in withdrawyng fram delectacioun and lekyng. 
Panne as fortitudo accordeth more with hardinesse, 
and gif we wolle be fortes 
we schal be more hardy þan ferful, 
so temporancia acordeþ more with insencibilite. 
Pan gif we wolle make vsselue temporate, 
we schul drawe toward þat party 
so p a t we schul be war 
of sencible delectacioun and likyng; 
for bettre it is to voide 
and forsake som laweful delectacioun and likynge þan it is to folwe eny þat is vnlaweful. 
Panne p e foure bien declared þat [bien] porposed in p e bygynnyng of p e chapitre. 
For first, 
it is declared what is temporancia, 
for it is a vertue p a t refrayneth sencible delectacioun and likyng. 
Pe seconde, 
it is declared whare inne temporancia stondeþ, 
for it stondeþ principalich in touch 
and lasse principalliche in tast and lest principalliche in oþere wittes. | Pe þridde, 
it is declared whiche 
and how manye maneres ben col. of temporancia, 
for þei bien foure: 
tweyne moderateth delectacioun and likynge in mete and drynke 
as sobrietas and abstinencia, 
and tweyne refreyneth delectacioun 
and likynge of lecherie 
as castitas and honestas 
þat hatte pudesicia also. Pe ferpe, 
it is declared hou we may make vsself temporate, for p a t we d o p most gif we absteyneth and spareth delectacioun and likyng. 
For as p e philosofre seith, ii Ethicorum, 
‡we schulle do as p e olde men of Troye dede to Eleyn, 
and seyde, 
"we schal do here awey": 
p a t is to menyng, 
we schal not beholde on here. 
r Chapter XVI The philosofre, iii Ethicorum, 
preueth by foure resons 
p a t he is worse 
and more to blame þat is intemporate 
p a n he p a t is [cloward and ferfole; 
for þe more wilfulliche a man d o p amys, 
þe more he is to blame. 
Also p e more ligtliche 
a man may do wel, 
gif he d o p nougt, 
p e more he is to blame 
for he mysdoþ 
p e more wilfulliche; 
and also he may more ligtliche do good 
and gete temporancia more ligtliche 
p a n fortitudo. 
And p a t he þat is intemporate 
d o p amys more wilfulliche 
p a n he p a t is coward 
and ferefol may be declared 
in tweye maner wise. First, 
for it is likynge to folwe intemporat wille, 
and it is sorefolle to fie and to drede, 
and a man doþ more wilfulliche 
what he d o p wiþ likynge p a n what he d o p with sorwe; 
p a n he þat mysdoþ for intemporancia 
doþ more wilfulliche 
þan he þat misdoþ for drede. 
Pe seconde, 
pe same is declared, 
for, 
as pe philosofer seith, 
drede stonyeth 
a man and makeþ kynde vnmevable and astonyeth 
and so d o p no likynge þat cometh of intemporancia. 
But whanne a man is astonyed, 
he is | 
as he were out of hymself 
and d o p þat he ne wot what f. he d 
o p wilfullich noþer with avisement. 
Panne he is lasse to blame 
þat mysdoþ for drede p a n he þat mysdoth by intemporancia, 
for p a t is more wilfollich 
p a n pe oper. 
A n d so it is declared 
þat he p a t is intemporate 
is more to blame in double manere p a n he þat is coward and ferfol, 
for he mysdoþ more wilfolliche; 
and so it may be declared in twey manere 
p a t he is more to blame p a t [may] more ligtliche do wel, 
for more ligtliche temporancia 
may be gete þan fortitudo. 
For as it is iseide 
in pe nexte chapitre tofore, 
we getep and cometh to temporancia 
absteynyng and withdrawyng vsself 
fro sencible delectacioun and likyng; 
but we may gete and come to fortitudo resyng and auntryng 
on periles 
dedes and dredful and assayenge 
gret figtynge and strong. 
And withdrawyng from delectacioun and likynge 
may be withoute eny peril. 
But aventuryng in dredful dedes 
in figtynge in bataille 
may not be withoute peril. 
Panne he is s withe to blame 
þat hath not temporancia, 
for he mygte come þerto wiþowte peril; 
and he p a t is withoute fortitudo 
is not so moche to blame, 
for þat vertue is gete 
with greete difficulté and greet peril. 
Also temporancia 
may be gete with lasse ‡defficulte p a n fortitudo, 
for many thinges we assayeth in oure lif 
p a t may be ineme 
to come to temporancia. 
For ofte we cometh to delectacioun 
and likyng in kynges, 
and by abstinence þerfro we bien desposed to be temporate; 
and it is not so of fortitudo, 
for not eche rees in bataille make}} 
vs fortes 
but pe bataille be rigtfol. 
But in cas al a mannys lif tyme he meteth nougt with I a rigtful bataille. 
And so we may not be so wel vsed to dedes of col. fortitudo 
as to dedes of temporancia, 
wherfore it is worse for vs to be intemporate and withoute temporancia 
p a n it is to be withoute fortitudo. 
Panne for a kyng 
p a t is not manliche noþer stedfast of herte is to blame, 
it is declared þat he is wors 
and more to blame gif he is intemporate and folwynge passions. 
But we may brynge newe resons declarynge þat a kyng is to blame gif he is intemporate. 
For, iii Ethicorum, 
pe philosofre toucheth of temporancia þre poyntes, 
by þe whiche p r e resons may be itake 
p a t it is most semelich 
þat princes be temporate. 
For as it is p e r e itouched, 
v intemporancia 
is a vice most bestial, childelich, foule and veile. 
And þat [it] 
is a vice most bestial 
it is declarid. 
For, 
as it is iseide tofor, 
temporancia and inte[m]porancia stonden in delectacioun and lekyng 
of touch and tast and haþ delectacioun and lekyng. 
Perinne [it] is comyn to vs and oþere beestes. 
Perfore, iii Ethicorum, 
it is iseid 
þat temporancia and intemporancia stonden in dilectacioun and likyng 
in þe whiche oþere bestes communeth with vs. 
Perfore intemporate men bien seruyle and bestiale. 
A best, 
for a lackeþ wit and vnderstondyng, 
is kyndelich seruyle and seruefc. 
Panne for it is vnsemeliche to a kyng 
þat schulde be a lord of oþere 
to be bestial 
and seruyle and seruant, 
it is vnsemelich to hym to be intemporate. 
Pe secunde, intemporancia is a vice most childliche, 
for children þat vsen not reson lyuen not by resoun but by passioun. 
Perfore moste we see hem folwe delectacioun (likyng) and passions. 
Perfore, iii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer likneth þe potencial concupiscible vertue 
in þe whiche is þe vice intemporancia to a child: 
as a child schulde be ruled by | pedage, 
þat is techer and maister, 
so þe potencial concupiscible f. 
vertue scholde be reuled by resoun. 
Panne for it is vnsemelich to a kyng 
to be a child 
in maners 
and not folwe resoun but passions, 
it is vnsemelich to hym to be i[nte]mporate. 
[Pe þridde], 
it is vnsemelich to a kyng to be intemporate, 
for þat vice is most vile and contemtible and despised; 
for intemporate men bien despised 
for þei desiren foule þynges and vile. 
Perfore gif he be in principate, 
þei bien most despised, 
for eueriche man hath indignacioun of a kyng 
þat is intemporate 
and folweth not resoun but passions. 
Wherfore gif it is semelich 
to a kynges persone 
to schewe hymself worthi 
to haue reuerence and worschep, 
it is most vnsemelich 
to hym to be intemporate. 
Suche ensample we hauen of kyng Sardinapallus 
þat was al wommanlich and al intemporate, 
as it is do and seid in olde storiis, 
and wolde not come out 
and speke with barouns and dukes of <his> regne. 
But al his talkyng 
and speche 
was in chambre with wymmen, 
and he sende his lettres to barons and dukes 
what he wolde 
þat thei schulde do. 
And it fil in a tyme 
þat a duk of his oost 
hadde longe iserued hym wel and trewelich, 
and þe kyng 
in a tyme wolde plese þis duke 
and heet brynge þe duk 
in to chambre to hym. 
And þe duk, 
þat was vsed to dedes of werre and of bataille, 
sey þat þis kyng 
was al wommanliche and bestial 
and hadde hym anoun in contempt and despite and hadde indignacioun 
of his foule doyng and wolde haue resed on hym. 
And þe kyng dradde and flee; 
for he trowed not to ascape 
þat dukes hondes, 
he closed hymself 
in an hous 
with al his tresour and araye 
of his hous and brenneth hymself. 
And we seeþ sencibliche 
þat þey 
þat ben intemporate and eueth | col. 
hem to sencible lust 
and likynge ben contempt and despised, 
for r intemporat men doun wrong to o p e r men in persones and namlich to spousede men 
as in wifes and dougtres and meueth men agenst hymself. 
And for kynges and princes schulde specialiche drede lest woodnesse of pe puple ryse agenst hem, 
pa[n] it is most spedful 
to hem to be temporate. Chapter XVII 
Tofore bien irekened twelf vertues, 
among þe whiche foure bien principal and cardinal, 
as prudencia, iusticia, fortitudo and temporancia. 
And þanne afterward we hauen ispoke 
of pes foure vertues, 
and declared how it is semelich 
p a t kynges and princes ben ihigt 
with pese foure vertues. 
It is furþermore to passe 
and to trete of olpere vertues [pat] stondeþ 
in outward good or in outward euel; 
and outward good is good of itself 
o p e r in ordre to oþere. 
Panne firste we schulle speke of vertues 
þat stondeþ in outward good 
þat is good of itsilf, 
and þerafter of †vertues 
p a t stondeþ 
in outward euel and of† vertues 
þat stondeth in outward good 
in ordre to o p e r e . 
And outward good is profitable 
(as moneye and richesse 
and al þat may be mesured 
in value be ment, or money) 
o p e r it is honest. 
Panne first we schal speke of vertues 
þat stondeþ in profitable good, 
and afterward of vertues 
þat stondeþ in honest good. 
And for oure knowleche cometh [fro] sencible wit, 
garnie for profitable good 
is more sencible p a n honest good, 
raþer it is to tretyng of vertues 
p a t stondeþ in profitable good. 
And as it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
in profitable good stonden twey vertues: liberalitas and magnificencia. 
Pes twey vertue stonden 
in spence in cost and in money, 
but not in pe same | wise. 
For liberalitas þat hatte f. largitas 
also stondeþ 
in mené spence and cost, 
but magnificencia stondeþ 
in greet spence and cost. 
And how it schal be vnderstonde, 
it schal be declared in þe processe. 
Panne for in spendyng 
it happeth to faille and to lacke 
and þat makeþ auaricia (chyncherie), 
and it happeth also to make to greet cost and spence 
and p a t maketh prodegalitas (passyng and fool spendyng), 
for eyper is agenst rigt reule of resoun it nedeth to haue som mené vertue 
bytwene auaricia and prodegalitas, 
and p a t vertue is liberalitas. 
And so it is declared whaat is liberalitas. 
For as fortitudo 
p a t is mené 
bytwene drede and hardinesse is perfore 
a vertue abatyng drede and moderatyng hardinesse, 
so liberalitas is mené bytwene auaricia and prodegalitas 
and is perfore 
a vertue abatyng auaricia (chyncherie and scarsete) 
and moderatyng prodygalitas (passyng and vnwis spendyng). 
And suche a vertue stondeþ 
in rigtful vse of moneye, 
and to rigtful vse of money 
nedep p r e thinges: first, 
þat it be not fonge 
where it scholde not; 
þe seconde, 
þat it be fonge where it schulde; 
pe þridde, 
v p a t it be spendid 
as it scholde. 
For it longeth to hym 
p a t is liberaus not 
byneme oþere men rentes 
and kepe his owne. For p e i liberalis loue not moneye for itsilf, 
but for to spende it þeweliche, 
he schal not his owne rentes 
mysspende and waste in veyne. 
Panne he schal not byneme 
oþere menne rentes, 
but he schal kepe wel his owne 
and make þerof resonable cost and spence. 
Pes bien pe p r e 
in pe whiche it semeth 
p a t liberalitas stondeþ. 
And liberalitas stondeþ not principalich in pes <pre>, 
for it stondeþ principalich 
in pew spence 
and cost and stondeþ 
in kepyng 
of his owne rentes 
and nougt benemynge | 
o p e r e men rentes col. 
by consequent and folwyng. 
For he p a t bynemeth profitable good 
and fongeth it not 
as he schulde sem[eth] coueytous to haue moneye. 
Perfore, iiii Ethicorum, 
pe philosofer seith þat vsurers, 
and baudes p a t leuen by horedom, 
and þei þat spoyleg dede men, 
and hasardes, 
leuen by foule wynnyng. 
And he clepeþ 
alle suche illeberales, 
for ech hasardour and dees playere is illiberalis, 
for he wynneth of his owne frendes 
to pe whiche he schulde do good. 
Panne liberalitas stondeþ 
in not fongyng 
what he schulde not fonge; 
but it stondeþ not principaliche gerinne. For þei p a t fongeþ 
what p e i scholde not fonge bien more verreyliche icleped iniusti, 
vnrigtfol, 
þanne illeberalis, chynches, 
as pe philosofer meneth, iiii Ethicorum. 
Wherfore liberalitas stondeþ not principalliche in nougt takynge 
what he schulde not take, 
noþer in takyng 
what he schulde take, 
but it stondeþ principalliche in spendyng 
as he schulde spende. 
For euerich þyng is for som what and þat is more principale. 
Pan for liberalis kepeth and saueth his awne rente, 
and takeþ what he schulde, 
and d o p it for he wolde 
of his owne rente make his owne cost and þew cost, 
[and] spende as it is semelich, 
þanne it is worthi to saye 
þat liberalitas stondeþ 
most principalliche in spendyng 
and in doyng good to oþere. 
And by pe consequent folwyng, 
it stondeþ in kepyng 
and sauyng his awne rente 
and also in nougt benemyng 
of oþer men rente. 
For, iiii Ethicorum, 
by fyue resons pe philosofer preueth p 
a t liberalitas stondeþ more principalliche in spendyng 
and in doyng good to o p e r e þeanne in kepyng and sauyng 
of his owne rente. 
For, 
as it is iseide, liberalitas stondeþ 
in pew vse of money; and pew vse of money [is] euyng money | 
to oþere men. 
And kepyng and f. sauynge of his owne rente, 
it is not vsyng of moneye 
but it is more verreyliche fgaderyngt and getyng of money. 
Perfore it is cleer 
p a t liberalitas ‡ stondeþ more in spendyng 
and in euyng money 
to oþere p 
a n it ddp in kepyng 
and sauyng of his owne rente. 
Pe seconde, pe same is declared, 
for it longeth 
to a vertue 
to do pe more good, 
and it is more good to do wel p a n t o soffry wel and to worche wel p 
a n not do foule dedes. 
And he p a t spendep wel 
and eueth good to o p e r e d o p wel, 
and he p a t takeþ his owne rente and money 
of his owne possessioun suffreþ wel 
oþere fongeþ wel, 
for he r The Governance of K 
i n g s a n d P r i n c e s doþ 
as he scholde. 
And he þat bynemeth not 
oþere menne good doþ not vile dedes. 
Panne gif it is bettere to do wel þa[n] not to do euel o p e r e soffre wel, 
bettre it is to spende wel 
þan not byne[m]e oþere men good 
oþere kepe wel his owne. 
Pe þridde, same is declared, 
for a vertue stondeþ 
most principalliche in þyng þat most preysyng stondeþ; 
[and most presyng stondeþ 
in spendyng wel 
and in doynge good to oþere þan in kepyng of his owne 
[opex not] byne[m]yng þer menne good. 
Panne liberalitas stondeþ 
most principalliche in þew spendyng 
and in doynge good to oþere. 
Pe ferþe, 
þe same is declared, 
for a vertue stondeþ 
more principalliche in þe most difficulté, and it is more difficulté to eue iftes to oþere men þarnie it is to kepe 
and saue his owne rente oper not to byneme oper menne good. 
For in kepyng and sauyng 
of his owne good 
is no difficulté of itself, 
for eche man is kyndelich inclined to loue hym self 
and to kepe and saue his owne good and catel. 
But in euyng of his owne good 
to o p e r e men is difficulté of itsilf, 
for oure owne good and catel perteyneth | 
to vssilf 
and we loueþ kyndeliche oure good and col. catel. So p a t coueytous men and chynches louen so moche outward good and catel so 
þat p e i holden and acounten money 
þat p e i hauen incomporate to hemsilf, 
for it semeth to hem 
þat whan money is itake of hem 
p a t som what of here owne body 
is itake of hem. 
Panne for oure awne good 
is as it were iuned to vs, 
it is not so greet difficulté to not byneme 
o p e r e menne good, 
pe whiche good we loueth nougt 
n o p e r bien iiuned þerto, as it is to eue oure owne good 
p a t we louen more 
for it is iuned ‡to vs. 
Wherfore in þew spendyng 
and in euyng good to 
o þ e r e , liberalitas stondeþ most principalliche 
as in þe most difficultee. 
Pe fifte, 
þe same is declared, 
for liberal men bien most iloued. 
For liberalitas stondeþ 
most in doyng 
for þe whiche a man is most iloued. 
And a man is not most iloued for he b e n e m e p not oper menne good noþer 
for a kepeth wel his owne, 
but he is most iloued gif he spendeþ wel and þewlich his owne rentes 
and eueth grete iftes to hem 
p a t bien good and worthi. 
Wherfore in wel spendyng and euyng good 
to oþere men liberalitas stondeþ principalliche. 
And so it is declared what is liberalitas: 
for it is a vertue abatyng malice 
as coueitise and chincherie 
and moderatynge prodigalité, 
passyng and vnwis spendyng. 
And it is declared where liberalitas stondeþ, 
for it stondeþ principalliche 
in pew spendyng and cost and resonable; 
by þe consequent folwyng, 
it stondeþ in kepyng 
of his owne rentes 
and in nout benemyng o p e r e menne goodes. 
It may ligtliche be ischewed 
how we may make | vsself liberales; 
f. for as fortitudo 
is more contrarie to drede p a n to hardynesse, 
perfore we maken vsself hardy drawyng more to audacia 
so p a t we be more hardy 
p a n lesse hardy; 
so for liberalitas 
is more contrarie to auaricia, 
v chyncherye, 
þan to prodegalite, 
we schul more drawe to prodigalité 
þan to auaricia. 
Pat is to menyng, 
we schal rafcer eue to moche þan to lite. Chapter XVIII The philosofer, iiii Ethicorum, wol mené þat liberalitas stondefc 
not in multitude of iftes 
but in þe habite and faculte and wille of þe feuere. 
For as it is þere iseid, 
ofte he þat geuefc leste iftes 
is most liberal gif he iueth of lite. 
Panne liberalitas takeþ mesure of þe proporcioun of giftes 
to þe possessioun of þe euere. 
Perfore þe philosofer seith þat a tyrant 
is not prodegus 
for it semeth þat he may not in iftes 
and in cost passe þe multitude 
of his possessioun and hauyng. 
Panne he þat haþ and fongeth 
as muche as he eueth and spendefc, 
[and] passefc not þe iftes 
in multitude of his posscessioun, 
in som wise for to speke 
may not be prodegus. 
Panne for kynges and princes hauen greet and passynge 
píente of possessioun, 
not oonliche they mow not be prodegi, 
but vnnefce they mowe recche to be liberales. 
Panne for fcey schulle alwey 
thenke 
þat he doþ lasse þanne 
it is semelich þerby, 
it may be seye hou vnsemelich 
it is to hem to be auary and chynches; 
for if þe regne of a man 
schal be kyndelich regne, 
it schal be likned to þynges 
þat we seefc in kynde. 
For in kynde is no thing 
an idel as philosofres menen. 
Panne noþer in rewlyng of þe lyf of mankynde schulde out be an idel. 
For mankynde is content with luyte good [þat] suffiseth to oon | persone, 
if eny coi. 
oo persone hath passynge moche good and riches, 
þat good is idel 
and þat richesse gif it is not ordeyned 
to good profit of oþere men. 
Panne þe more good and richesse kynges and princes hauen, 
þe worse þei bien and þe more de[t]e[s]table 
iffceyben auari and chinches. 
iiii Ethicorum, 
by þre resouns þe philosofer 
preueth þat auaricia, chyncherie, 
is worse þan prodegalitas. 
Perfore it is fol detestable gif kynges and princes bien auari. 
For kynges and princes schulde forsake and voide auari[ci]a, 
þat he schulde gif it myte be be rafcer prodigi þan auari, 
for it were bettre 
þat þey were prodigi þan auari. First, 
for it is bettre to haue a iuel 
as it is curable 
þan an iuel þat is not curable, 
and prodigalitas is an iuel 
þat is curable specialliche in age. 
Forfceyþatbien prodigi in goufce 
may be auari in elde; 
for comunlich olde men ben more auari 
and chynches þan onge men, 
and comunlich whanne þey comen to elde here prodegalitas passefc 
and þei leueþ to be prodigi. 
Also prodegalitas is curable by nede, 
for comonliche þei þat bien prodigi bien nedy 
for þei hauen greet rente. 
Panne þei assayeth defaute and nede, 
and becometh not prodigi. 
Panne, 
as þe philosofer meneth, 
prodegalitas is an yuel 
þat is curabel 
by age othere by nede. 
And auaricia is an yuel þat is not curabel, 
for þe more a man passeth 
in The Governance of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s auaricia, 
and pe more he draweth to elde, pe more auarus and chynche he is. 
Panne gif it is vnsemelich pat pe heed of pe regne, 
þat schulde rewle al pe regne, 
schuld in þewes haue a euel pat is incurabel, 
it is fol detestabel 
to a kyng to be auarus, 
for it is knowe 
þat it were bettre pat 
he were prodegus pan auarus. 
Pe seconde, 
pe same is declared, 
for prodegalitas is more nyge to | f. vertue pan auaricia, 
for liberalis fongeþ not gladliche 
and geueth gladliche, 
and prodegus also dop bothe and auarus dop neuer noþer. 
Panne prodegalitas and liberalitas bien not diuerse, but for prodigus geueth nougt 
as he schulde 
and to wham he schulde; 
wherfore, 
for prodigus loueþ 
not money noþer liberalis, 
he þat is prodegus 
may sone be liberalis. 
Panne gif it is semelich 
in alle wise pat a kyng be vertuous 
in so moche as auaricia 
is more contrarie to vertue 
þan is prodegalitas, 
it is worse pat a kyng be auarus þan prodegus. 
Pe þridde, 
it is detestable, 
for a kyng is sette in þe regne 
for sauacioun þerof 
and for to profite 
to hem pat bien gerinne ; 
and he þat is auarus profiteth to no man, for he is also euel to hymself 
and he 
þat is prodegus profiteth to many men. 
Panne in alle wise 
it is detestable gif 
a kyng is auarus. 
For it is declared pat it is as þei 
it were inpossible pat kynges be prodigi 
and pat it is in al wise detestable gif kynges bien auari, 
it is to declaryng 
þat it is semelich 
for hem to be large, liberal and communycatif; 
for þÍS vertue þat stondeþ 
in spendyng and cost is 
by a certeyn similitude, 
aliknesse, icleped largitas, liberalitas, and communicabilitas, 
and is cleped largitas 
bi liknes of vessel. For vessel with strait mouth and narwe geueþ not largeliche what is gerinne in greet plentee. 
Perfore in spendynge and giftes 
a man is cleped largus 
for he geueth largeliche 
pat he hath as a vessel WÍþ large mouth. 
Pe moo mote haue water of a welle, 
pe more large mote 
pe mouþ þerof be, 
so pe moo moste haue influens 
and help of pe kyng þan of oþere men, 
so moche pe more large and liberal pe kyng mot be. 
Pe secunde, 
þÍS vertue hatte liberalitas 
for þei pat bien liberal hauen | coi. 
þe liknesse of fre men; 
and auari bien not fre, 
but pey bien bonde 
and seruantes to moneye. 
Wherfore gif it is vnsemeliche to kynges 
and princes 
to be seruantes and bonde, 
it is conuenient and semelich 
to hem 
to be liberal and large. 
Pe þridde, 
pis vertue is icleped communicabilitas, 
for þerby men ‡ communeþ here good and catel 
for þe whiche communicacioun 
þei ben most loued of oper men, 
for þei þat ben liberal and large beth most iloued. 
Wherefore gif it is most semelich 
þat kynges and princes be iloued of hem 
þat ben in þe regne, 
it is most semelich pat pei ben liberal and large. 
It langiþ to hym þat is liberal, first, to take hede hou moche h[e] giuiþ 
pat he giue not more 
noþer lasse pan he schulde. 
Pe secunde, 
r he schal take hede to wham he geueth p 
a t he geue to hem not p 
a t he schulde not geue. 
Pe þridde, 
he schal take hede wherfore he eueth p a t he may eue for good and for non o p e r cause. 
For kynges and princes may vnnethe faile of pe wey of libéralité in euyng more p a n he schulde, 
for gret spence and iftes may wnnepe passe pe multitude of rentes. 
And gif it happeth þat a liberal man geueþ more 
p a n he schulde, 
he is moderatliche sory, 
as pe philosofer wol mené, 
for it greueth more a liberal man 
gif he eueth lasse 
p a n he schulde or gif he spendeþ 
not 
where it nedeþ þanne it greueth hym gif he spendeþ 
whare it nedeþ nougt. 
And kynges and princes faillen of pe wey of libéralité 
in geuyng 
to hem it nedeth not, 
o p e r wharfore it nedeþ not, 
for p e i geueþ, 
as pe philosofer seith, 
to mynstrelles and to flaterers 
and to o p e r 
e to wham it nedeþ not, 
for it were more semelich 
þat suche be pore p a n riche. 
Also pey geuen wherfore it nedeþ not for p 
e i geueth not for good bot more 
for to be preysed 
and for veyn glorie 
o p e r for som o p e r cause. 
Panne it is I semelich p 
a t kynges be liberal, 
[and for to be liberal] 
hem nedeþ to f. do good to hem þat bien good and bi cause þat p e i ben good. Chapter XIX 
Hit is iseid tofore 
p a t per bien twey vertues of pe whiche on stonde)) 
in modérât spendyng and cost and hatte liberalitas, 
and o p e r e stondej) 
in greet spendyng and cost and hatte magnificencia. 
Bote for more and lasse maketh not diuers special kynde of kynges 
as pe philosofer menej), primo Poleticorum, 
it semeth not p a t liberalitas and magnificencia bien sufficientliche distyngwed by p a t p a t pe on stondej) 
in passyng gret spendyng and coost and [p]e o p e r e in mené spendynge and cost. 
Perfore it is to wetynge 
p a t by resoun and kynde a vertue stondeth in good and difficulté. 
Panne for in gret spendyng and cost 
is special resoun of goodnesse and difficulté 
p a t is not in mené spendyng and cost, 
perfore magnificencia 
p a t stondeþ 
in greet spendyng and cost 
schal be cleped anoþer vertue. 
Panne he hatte liberalitas 
p a t stondeþ in mené spendyng and cost. 
O p e r we may saye þat spendyng and cost may haue ‡comparisoun to tweyne: 
to his faculte 
p a t makeþ spendyng and cost; 
to þe workes and dedes 
in pe whiche he maketh spendyng and cost. 
Panne in spendyng and cost of 
m[o]ny stondeþ twey vertues: 
on p a t 
[euen]eth giftes and cost and spendyng 
to his faculte and richesse 
(pat makeþ spendyng and cost), 
and p i s hatte liberalitas. 
Perfore it is iseid 
p a t liberalitas 
stondej in mené spendyng and cost 
and not 
by pe selue cost 
but by comparisoun to hym 
p a t makeþ spendyng and cost. 
Perfore a man mygte geue grete giftes and moneye 
and be auarus and chynche gif þilke giftes 
were not ieuened 
to his faculte and richesse 
p a t geueth v þilke I giftes. 
For it is seid tofore, liberalitas stondeþ 
not in many 
gift.es col. and grete, 
but he þat is liberaus eueneþ his spendyng and cost 
to his owne faculte and richesse. 
But magnifiais wol euene his spendyng 
and cost to þe workes 
þat he makefc. 
Perfore þe vertue magnificencia 
hath þe name of workes 
and of facio, 
makynge. 
Magnifiais is cleped 
as it were magna faciens, 
makynge and doynge grete thinges. Andfcerforeit is þat 
in what gree euere a man be 
and what faculte and richesse 
euer he haue, 
lite oþer moche, 
it is difficulté to vse þe richesse wel 
and to euene wel 
þe spendynge and cost 
to þe faculte 
and to þe richesse. 
Perfore liberalitas stondeþ 
in me[ne] spendyng and cost. 
For spendyng and cost is acounted moche 
oþer lite in itself 
oþer in comparison to þe faculte and richesse. 
And for to acounte spendyng 
and cost gret oþer lite in itself, 
so liberalitas stondefc in gret spendyng 
and cost gif he [þat] doþ 
þe spendyng and cost haþ gret faculte and riches, 
and in m[ene] spendyng and cost gif he þat doþ þe spendyng and cost haue 
but mené faculte and riches. 
But gif þe despendyng and cost is gret oþer litel not in itself 
but in þe comparisoun to þe faculte and richesse, 
[þanne liberalitas is alwey 
in mené spendyng and cost. 
For as litel spendyng and cost is mené 
in comparisoun to þe pore, 
so gret spendyng and cost is mené 
in comparisoun to riche men. 
Panne for liberalitas stondefc in spendyng and cost not in itself, 
but in comparisoun to þe faculte and 
richesse,] fcanne þe spendyng and cost 
is not acountted mené and gret, 
but onliche mené. 
Panne liberalitas 
þat stondefc in spendyng and cost proporciónate to faculte and richesse streccheth to al faculte and richesse; 
and so for in mené faculte and richesse 
is difficulté a man to haue hymself wel þerinne. 
And magnificencia stondefc in spendyng and cost semlich to workes 
and not in alle workes and dedes, 
for it is not difficulté to make semelich spendyng and cost [in] al maner workes and dedes 
but onliche in grete workes | and dedes. 
Perfore magnificencia 
hath þe name of magnis f. factoribus and magnis operibus, 
grete makers and grete workes. 
And in grete workes it happeth to faile 
for som man setteþ 
not his entent 
how he may make grete workes, 
but how litel he may spende 
and suche oon 
is icleped paruificus; 
and som spendeþ in suche workes 
more þan it nedeþ 
to spende in suche workes 
and suche on is icleped consumptor, 
a wastour. 
And þe philosofer clepeth suche on bonausus, 
fyre and fornax, 
an ouene oþer forneys, 
for suche oon consumeth and wasteþ 
as an ouen. 
And somme in grete workes maken resonable spendyng and cost and suche
oon is vertuous and icleped magnifiais. 
Panne magnificencia is mené bitwene paruificencia and consumpcio, wastyng, 
as liberalitas is mené bytwene auaricia and prodegalitas. 
Panne it is declared what is magnificencia. 
For as liberalitas abatefc r auaricia and moderateth prodigalitas, 
so magnificencia abated paruificencia 
and moderateþ consumpcion, wastyng; 
and as liberalitas makeþ spendyng 
and cost proporciónate 
to faculte and richesse, 
so magnificencia maketh spendyng 
and cost proporcionat to grete workes. 
But for it is declared what is magnificencia, 
it is to wetynge 
where inne it stondeþ; 
for as it longeth to p i s doyng, 
man hath comparisoun to foure: to God, 
to al pe comynte, 
to certeyn special persones, 
and to hymself. 
Touching al pese, 
magnificus schal haue hymself wel and semelich; 
but he schal not sette his entent [i]liche principalliche in alle pese, 
for firste man schal be magnificus 
in ordeynyng of Go<d>des seruice gif his faculte and richesse telleþ þerto 
and he schal make grete temples 
and worschepful sacrefice and worthi array. 
Perfore, | iiii Eth- col. icorum, 
it is iseid 
p a t pe worschepful spendyng and cost p a t magnificus schal make 
and do schal be do 
in pe worschep of God. Pe secunde, 
it longeth to hym 
p a t is magnificus gif he hath wherewith to make semelich spendyng and cost in al pe comynte, 
for þe comyn good and catel longeth 
in som wise to God. 
Perfore pe philosofer seith 
p a t comyn good and catel is som what iliche to gode 
p a t is halwed to God, 
for Goddis good is forsympelliche represented 
in oon singuler persone 
and schineth fui faire in al pe comynte. 
Pe þridde, 
magnificus schal haue hymself semelich 
to a certeyn special persone 
as to persones 
p a t ben worthi worschep, for in p a t is magnificencia 
J most ischewed whan a man doth good 
to hem that ben worthye. 
[Pe ferþe], 
magnificus schal haue hymsilf semliche touchinge his owne persone, 
for he schal haue hemself swythe manliche 
in grete workes touchyng his owne persone; 
and gret workes may be clepid workes 
þat dureþ 
al a manis lif tyme, 
as hous and grete boldes, 
o p e r workes p a t ben seide ido 
in a mannes lif tyme, 
as festes of mariage and of weddyng and of knythode. 
And it is semelich to hym 
as it is seid, iiii Ethicorum, 
to araye semlich wonyng place, 
for he schal sette his entent more 
how he schal make wonderful hous 
and longe duryng þanne 
how he may make faire hous 
in sigt and vntristi. 
Also it is semelich to hym p 
a t is magnificus 
to make grete and solempne festes 
of manage and of weddyng 
and of knythode 
and of o p e r e suche p 
a t falleth but seide. 
And so it is declared 
what is magnificencia 
and where inne it stondeþ, 
for it stondeþ 
in greet spendyng 
and cost in greet workes. 
But it stondeþ principaliche in greet spendyng 
and cost in seruice and worschep of God, 
and al pe comynte. 
And by pe consequent folwynge it | 
f. stondeþ 
in greet spendyng 
and cost in worthi persones, 
and in himsilf also. 
For it is declared 
what is magnificencia 
and where inne it stondeþ, 
it may sone be som del yknowe 
how a man may make hymsilf magnificus, 
for as liberalitas 
is more contrarie to auaricia 
p a n t o prodigalitas, 
so magnificencia is more contrarie to paruificencia 
p a n t o consumpcio, 
v wastyng. 
if he hath wherwith, 
a man schal make hymself magnificus, drawyng to consumpcio, wastyng, 
so p a t he make in grete workes rather to moche spendyng 
and cost þan to ligte. Chapter XX The philosofer, iiii Ethicorum, 
toucheþ sex propertees of hym 
p a t is paruificus, 
cheef negon and chinche, 
p a t were most agenst kynges and princes gif 
p e i hadde pake sexe propretees. 
Pe firste propreté [is] 
for in al dedes and doyng he failleþ 
and is to scarse, 
and p a t is iknowe 
by pe name paruificus, 
for he hath pe name of paruificus, 
of makynge litel dedes with defaute and scarste. 
Pe seconde properte is for gif it happeth p a t paruificus 
d o p grete dedes, 
he lesep moche good for to saue a lite. 
Perfore it is iseid in a prouerbe 
p a t vile men lesep and spilled festes of mariage and weddyng 
for an eyg worth of peper; 
for whan a maketh not semelich cost 
and spendyng in a greet feste, 
p e i wollen spare a litel cost 
and sehendeþ al pe feste. 
Pe þridde, paruificus d o p late al þat he d o p , 
for hym semeth as greuous to do awey money 
as to kette or kerue me[m]bris of his owne body. 
Perfore as gif a man neded 
to be maymed 
o p e r ikorue, 
he wol tarie p 
a t maymyng and keruyng 
and putte it of 
as longe as he mygte. 
P[e ferþ]e, his entent is not how he may make grete workes, 
as how he may make and geue gret giftes, 
noþer how he may make festes of mariage, 
| but al his entent 
is how he may make ligt spendyng and cost. col. 
For it is his propreté to telle more pris of moneye 
p a n of grete workes. 
Panne he is more besy and castynge 
how he may spende ligt p a n how he may make grete workes. 
His ñipe properte, 
alwey to spende w i p c a r e and þynkyng and sorwe. 
For it is iseid 
p a t paruificus acounteþ outward good and catel p a t he hath 
as it were incomporate to hymsilf 
and as it were pertinent 
to his awne substance. 
And for he loueth his catel 
so 
and so continewith hymsilf þerto, 
perfore as in keruynge of body (of departyng of continual parties) 
comeþ wo and sorwe, 
so in departyng of money, 
p a t is by spendyng and cost, 
for per is as it were departynge of continual parties; 
for paruificus acounteþ his money 
as it were incomporate 
and continuede to hymself. 
Perfore he may not spende 
and do away his money 
withoute wo and sorwe. 
And in p i s paruificus 
accordeþ with auarus, 
for euerich paruificus is auarus 
as eche magnificus is liberalis. 
Pe sixte, 
p e i paruificus 
d o p nougt, 
hym semeth alwey p a 
t he d o p more p a n he d o p o p 
e r schulde for it is iseid 
þat paruificus telleþ more pris of moneye p a n of giftes and cost p a t ben workes of vertues. 
For p e i acounteþ money 
ful lef and derworth, 
and werkes of vertues 
þei accounten vile and teilen no pris þerof. 
Panne for vnnepe a man may eue so litel of þing p a t is leef and dere for þyng 
þat is vile 
but it seme hym p a t he eueth more p a n he schulde, 
for paruificus may not spende so lite 
in what werk euere it be, 
hym semeth alwey 
þat he spendeþ more p 
a n he schulde. 
Wherfore gif it is shame for a kyng 
to be scarce 
and faille in alle dedes; 
and to lese moche good for lyte; 
and alwey to tarye 
and do no p 
y n g sone 
and with good wille; 
and neuere | sette his entent 
to make f. 
and do grete workes and vertues, 
but how he may spende litel 
and alwey spende agenst herte 
and with wo 
and w i p sorwe; 
and whanne [he] ddp not, 
wene p a t he makeþ grete workes: 
for alle pes ben vile 
and ben agenst pe kynges maieste, 
in alle wise it is shame 
to a kyng to be paruificus. 
And p a t it is semelich 
for a kyng to be magnificus 
it is preued tofore 
atte pe fulle, 
þer we declared wherinne magnificencia stondej. 
[For it is iseid 
p a t magnificencia stondeþ]principallich 
as in seruice and worschep of God 
and in þe comynte, 
and by þe consequent folwyng in worthi persones 
and in hymself also. 
Panne for a kyng is heed of þe regne and commyne and worschepful and reuerent persone, 
and to hym it longeþ to geue, 
departe and dele pe good of pe regne, 
it is most semelich 
þat he be magnificus. 
For he is heed of pe regne 
and þerby he hath pe liknesse of God 
p a t is heed and prince of alle, 
it is most semelich 
þat he bere hymsilf 
as magnificus schulde in makyng holy temples 
and ordinaunce and araye of seruice and worschip of God. 
And for he is a comune persone 
to pe whiche al pe comynte is ordeyned and al pe regne, 
it is most semelich to hym to bere hymself as magnificus schulde 
in pe departyng and delyng pe comyn good and catel and in finges 
þat longeth to al pe regne. 
Also for to hym it longeth most to departe and dele pe good and catel of pe regne in alle wise, 
it is most semelich to hym to haue hymself 
as magnificus schulde to worjsy persones 
to pe whiche p a t good and catel longeþ worthiliche. 
Also for it is iseid 
þat a kynges persone is reuerent and worthi worschepe, 
it longeth to a kyng to haue hymself as magnificus schulde to his owne persone 
and to o p e r | persones 
p a t col. bien aboute hym 
as to his wif and children 
and o p e r e maynye; 
hauyng worschepful place to dwelle inne; 
and makyng semelich festes of mariage; 
and drawynge to hym wonderfullich cheualrie. 
r Chapter XXI The philosofre, iiii Ethicorum, 
capitulo De Magnificencia, 
toucheth sex propretees of hym 
p a t is magnificus, 
pe whiche nedeth kynges and princes to haue. 
Pefirste,magnificus owep t o haue wisdam 
and connyng for it is seid 
þat it longefc to hym in gret workes to make semelich spendyng and cost, 
and he may not knowe spendyng and cost accordyng to grete workes 
but if he be wys and connynge. 
Pe secunde propreté 
is to make gret spendyng and cost 
þat he äffende not hymself 
but þat mot be for good ende; 
for it is comyn to eche vertue to wirche and doo not for fauour noþer 
for bost and preisyng among men, 
but by cause of good ende. 
But specialliche þat is a properte of magnificencia; 
for in gret workes of magnificencia, 
[a]s whan a man hath hymsilf 
as magnificus 
in seruice and worschep of God 
and to þe comyn profit 
and to worthi persones 
þanne he semeth most glorious 
and is most ipreysed among men, 
þanne it is hard in suche dedes 
and doynge not desire preysyng of men. 
And for a vertue stondefc in good and in difficulté, 
þerfore it longefc most to hym 
þat is magnificus 
in his grete workes 
and iftes 
to sette his entent in good ende 
and not on fauoure and veyn glorie and praysyng of men. 
His þridde propreté 
is to make spendyng, cost, 
and eue iftes sone and wifc likynge. 
For he þat acounteþ and rekeneth, 
or he eue iftes smale spendyng and cost, 
and euefc not sone and wiþ likynge what | f. he schulde eue, 
is not magnificus bote paruificus. 
Perfore, iiii Ethicorurn, 
it is iseid 
þat besinesse of acountyng 
and rekenyng is paruifica. 
Pe ferþe properte is to sette his entent more 
how he may make gret werk best 
and most semlich þan to wite and knowe 
how gret spendyng and cost 
nedefc to þat werk. 
As gif magnificus schal make a temple 
in worschep of God 
or eue eny iftes to worthi persones, 
he schal sette his entent more how he may make þat temple wonderfol and faire 
and how iftes 
may be grete and semelich 
þan to wete and knowe how moche money hym nedefc to spende in suche workes and iftes. 
Pe fifte propreté 
is þat magnificus 
is excellentliche liberal, 
for it is al on to be magnificus 
and to be excellentliche liberal. 
For, 
as it schal be declared wifcinne, 
magnificencia is a certein perfeccioun 
and a certeyn hitnesse of libéralité, 
as magnanimitas is a certeyn perfeccioun 
and a certeyn heinesse of al vertues. 
Panne ‡for he þat makefc semelich spendyng and cost in grete workes is magnificus and he þat makefc semelich spendyng and cost is liberal, 
‡þanhe þat makefc most semelich spendyng and cost 
as magnificus doþ is most liberal. 
His [s]exte properte 
is to make more solempne werk 
with certeyne spendyng and cost þanne paruificus 
with so moche spendyng and cost; 
for paruificus fondeþ alwey 
to spare money and cost, 
as it is iseid tofore, 
and leseth moche for lyte. 
And magnificus, 
for he reccheth not of acountes and rekenyng, 
a maketh with so moche cost 
moche grettere werk 
and more solempne 
for he spareth not spendyng and cost. 
Sum tyme it happeth þat auarus spendeþ more in som dede and nede þan liberalis, 
| for alwey auarus fondeþ to withdrawe som semelich col. spendyng and cost þe[i] þey be litel and smal. 
Perfore he makefc þe v work vnsemelich 
in pe whiche he makeþ gret cost and spendyng. 
Wherfore with so moche cost for so moche, 
and som tyme with lasse, 
magnificus or liberalis makeþ fairere werk 
and more solempnere p a n paruificus or auarus. 
It is not hard to knowe 
p a t kynges and princes schulde haue pese condicions and propretees for pey scholde be specialliche wis and konnynge and knowe what spendyng 
and cost nedeþ 
and to whiche workes. 
And to hem it longeth 
to geue grete giftes 
and to make grete spendyng 
and coste for a good ende; 
and pey scholde sette here 
entent most in good ende 
for p e i scholde reule and brynge al pe comynte to good ende. 
Also to hem it longeth 
to make spendyng 
and cost al redy and sone 
and with likyng. 
For, 
as it is iseide tofore, 
kynde is apaied 
with litel and richesse 
is an ydel and in veyn, 
but pevoî be made pewe giftes and semlich spendyng and cost. 
Panne pe more faculte and richeise kynges and princes hauen, 
pe more semelich it is for hem to geue 
pe more gret reward and giftes, 
also to spende pe more prestlich and sone 
w i p pe more likyng. 
Also it is most semelich for kynges and princes 
to sette here 
entent more to wete 
and to knowe 
how he schal make 
and do excellent workes 
garnie how p e i mowe spare moneye and cost; 
but also it is semelich for hem 
to be excellentliche liberal and alwey 
to make grete workes and solempne. 
Panne it is semelich 
for kynges and princes to haue al pe propretees of magnificus 
most fol and p[ar]fitliche. 
And so, iiii Ethicorum, 
pe philosofre wol mené 
p a t not ech man may be magnificus, 
for not ech man may make gret spendyng | and cost; 
for, 
as it is iseid p e r e , 
suche mot f. 
be gentil men noble and glorious. 
Werfore pe more noble 
a kyng is passyng 
o þ e r e men, 
pe more semelich it is for hym 
to be magnificus 
and haue propretees of magnificus. Chapter XXII As it is iseid tofore, 
som outward good is profitable, 
as money and generallich al p a t may be preysed 
by mesure or valew of money, 
and som good is honest as honour and worschep. 
Panne as in profitable good stonden twey vertues, 
on in gret spendyng and cost as magnificencia, 
and anoþer in mené spendyng and cost as liberalitas, 
so in honest good stonden twey vertues, 
on in greet honour and worschep as magnanimitas, 
and anoþere in mene honour and worschep 
and may be cleped by a comyn name, 
honoris amatiua. 
[A man may haue hymself] in gret honour and worschep 
in p r e maner wise, 
for som hauen defaute and failen gerinne 
and is icleped pusillanimus, 
p a t is <vnherty> - < ‡ mode ‡les>; 
and som passen 
and is icleped presumptuosus, proude; 
and som hath hymself wel 
and as he scholde 
and is icleped magnanimus. 
For we seeth p a t som is of hymsilf 
r able to grete dedes 
and may do grete dedes 
and vse grete dedes 
and is som what vnherty and coward 
and wiþdraweth hymself 
fro suche grete dedes, 
Joanne suche oon hath defaute and failleth. 
And somme agenward passen and putte]} 
hemself to som dedes pe whiche he may not worthilich do at pe folle; 
and þe philosofer clepeth suche on ka[u]nus, 
id est, fumosus et ventosus (smeche and fol of wynd), 
and we may clepe suche oon presumptuosus. 
Panne magnanimus 
is mené bytwene pusillanimus and presumptuosus, 
for he withdraweth hym nougt fro grete dedes p 
a t he may worthilich do 
atte pe fülle as pusillanimus d o p , 
| noþer taketh more col. 
vppon hym p 
a n he may worthilich do 
at pe folle 
as presumptuos dooþ. 
And so it is declared what is magnanimitas: 
for as liberalitas is mené bitwene auaricia (scarsete and chincherie) 
and prodegalitas (passyng and vnwys spendyng), 
and is perfore a certeyn vertue abatyng auaricia 
and moderatyng prodegalitas, 
so, 
for magnanimitas is mené bytwene pusillanimitas and presumpcioun, 
it is a vertue abatynge pusillanimitas 
and moderatyng presumcioun. 
For it is declared what is magnanimitas, 
it may sone be iknowe 
where inne it stondeþ; 
and it semeth p a t pe philosofer, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
wol mené p a t magnanimitas stondeþ 
in honour and worschip, faculte and richesse, 
and in principates, 
and generalliche in al fortune and happes and stondeþ 
not iliche principaliche in al pese. 
For magnanimitas stondeþ principalliche in honour and worschip 
(and not in al honour and worschip 
but in gret honour and worschep) 
and by pe consequent folwyng 
in faculte and richesse 
and in principate 
and in fortune 
and in happes good and yuel. 
For as pe philosofer meneth, 
among outward good pe most is honour and worschep; 
for richesse and principate 
and o p e r outward good bien 
not so good as honour and worschep, 
for commonlich men ordeynen suche good 
for to come 
j^erby to honour and worschep. 
Panne as it is iseid 
p a t pe vertue fortitudo stondeþ principalliche in defficulte and peril in werre and in bataille, 
for gerinne is most difficulté, 
and stondeþ by pe consequent folwyng 
in o p e r e perils 
so p a t he p a t is fortis 
b e r e p hymself wel also in o p e r e perils, 
so magnanimitas stondeþ principalliche 
in honour and worschep 
in pe beste outward good, 
and by pe consequent folwyng it stondeth in richesse 
and in | principate 
so þat magnanimitas hape hym- f. sylf 
as he schulde in hauyng richesse and principate 
and in takynge aworth fortune 
and gode happes and euel. 
For magnanimus is ilikned to tetragonus 
Qpat is euene squar 
p a t lip o p 
e r stondeþ liehe wel on euery side), 
so magnanimus failleth not p 
a t he ne holdeþ hym apayed. 
For gif he is worschepped 
or hath gret fortune, 
he is not mysprou<d>e; 
and gif he is despised 
and hath grete infortune and euel happes, 
he holdeþ hym apayed. 
For in eche Staat magnanimus 
can haue hymself 
as he scholde and pusillanimus 
v can not suffry fortunes. Perfore Andronicus Peripatheticus seyfc 
þat þe workes of pusillanimus bien wonderful, 
for he ne may suffry worschip 
ne dispite noþer fortune 
noþer good happes noþer yuel. 
if he is worschepped or hath good fortune, 
he swellefc and wexeth my<s>prou<d>. 
For it is declared what is magnanimitas 
and where inne it stondefc, 
it is to declarynge how a man may make hym magnanimus. 
For among oþere þat draweth vs to magnanimitas, 
oon is to sette litel 
by outward good 
what good it euere be - worschep 
oþer principate 
oþer othere suche good what euere it be. 
For it is iseyd þat pusillanimus can not suffry fortune, 
but wexit mysproude 
for a lite fortune 
and is ouercome 
in vnfortune and myshap. 
But magnanimus fareth not so, 
but as it is seide 
he can suffre fortune 
and in eche Staat bere hymsilf 
as he scholde. 
And þe cause whi a man can not suffre fortune 
is for he setteth 
to moche by outward good. 
Perfore whan he geteth eny such good, 
hym semeth þat he hath gete al 
and swelleth and wexeth mysproude; 
and whan he leseth 
oughtfcerof,he weneth to lese al 
and is ouercome and sory. 
I col. Perfore gif we telleth pris of workes of vertue, 
and settefc not bi outward good 
but in as muche as outward good 
is mené for to come 
to vertues in alle wise, 
we hauen þe vertue magnanimitas 
and conneþ suffre fortune. 
For gif richesse encreseth and oþer outward good, 
% we bien not 
mysproudefcerfore,for we acountefc not suche good principal good and best. 
And gif we hauefc myshappes, 
[we] holdefc vs apayed 
as we schulde 
for we settefc lite by suche good. Chapter XXIII The philosofer, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
reherseth manye propretees of hym þat is magnanimus, 
among þe whiche we may rekene sixe þat nedefc to kynges and princes to haue. 
So þat þe firste propreté of magnanimus be 
þat he haue hymself wel in perilles of werre and of bataille 
and nogt to haue hymself to peril to smale thinges and nedes 
but for grete, 
as for suche of þe whiche % may come greet profite and good. 
And whan he puttefc hymsilf so to peril, 
he schal be so constans and stedefast 
in his doyng so þat gif he seefc 
þat it is spedfol, 
he schal not spare his owne lif 
as þe philosofre seith, iiii Ethicorum. 
Pe secunde, magnanimus schal haue hymsilf wel in rewardes and giftes, 
for magnanimus settefc litel 
by outward good 
and muche by workes of vertues. 
Perfore for he þat geueth manye of giftes 
doþ workes of vertues, 
it is semelich to magnanimus 
to geue manye giftes 
as it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum. 
Pe fcridde, 
it longeth to hym 
to make fewe workes, 
for it is iseid 
þat magnanimitas stondefc in grete workes, 
as in workes of þe whiche may come grete worschep, 
and suche workes fallen not ofte. 
Perfore it is semelich to magnanimus 
to make fewe workes. 
Pe ferþe, it is semelich to hym to schewe hymselfe out|ward as it is f. inward so p a t he be a soth sayere 
and not a Here, 
and to be open and iknowe outward 
whether he loueth oþer hatef), 
and to telle more of sothnesse and of trouthe p a n of opynyons 
and of tales as p e philosofer wolde mené, 
iii[i] Ethicorum. 
Pe fifte, 
it is semelich to magnanimus 
to sette not by þei he be preised noþer 
p e i he be blamed, 
for suche doyng is acounted 
among outward good 
of þe 
whiche he telleth no gret pris, [for as it is seide he settee litel by outward good]. 
Pe sixte, 
he schal not flatry noþer prayse iftes of o p e r men, 
and namelich he schal not do so 
in comparisoun to outward good. 
For he p a t playneth of outward good 
olper prayseth outward good of oþere men 
for to haue suche good 
is som del pusillanimus, 
for he setteth to moche by outward good. 
For Seneca seit þat no thing is more dere ibout p a n what is gete by prayers. 
Pese propretees p a t þe philosofer rekeneth, 
gif þei bien wel vnderstondyng, 
kynges and princes schul haue; 
for kynges schulde not put hymself 
to al maner peril 
but for greet nede 
as for defence of p 
e fey and sauyng of þe regne. 
And gif ^>er happeth so grete nede p 
a t a kyng schal put his men 
and hymself to peril, 
he schulde be constans 
and stedefast and magnanimus 
þat he be al redy 
to put his lif in peril 
for worschep of God 
and for þe comune profit. 
Pe secunde, kynges and princes schulde eue many iftes, 
for in þe heiere gree þei bien aboue olper men, and p e more good and riches þei han in passing 
o p e r men, 
in so moche p 
e i schulde passe olper men 
in werkis of vertuis 
and in reward and giftis. 
Pe þridde, 
p e i scholde make fewe workes, 
for grete workes and nedes 
ben not so manye as oþere. 
Panne it is not semelich for kynges and princes 
to spede by hemself 
al maner nedes 
by þe nedes neuer so litel and smale, 
noþer it | is semelich to hem to do al workes and nedes; 
col. 
but for to take þe more hede to grete doynges and nedes þat bien fewe, 
p e i schulde commytte to o p e r e men smale nedes þat ben manye. 
Pe ferpe, 
pey schul schewe hemsilf outward suche as þei ben inward for p e i bien þe rule of o p e r e and p e reule schulde be not fais ne crokede. 
Also p e i schulde be oponliche iknowe 
w h þ e r J^ey loue oþer hate - 
<and rese opo no man vnwarned nor sodaynly nor with feyned sembland of luf> - 
so þat p e i hate opunlich vices 
and pursewe euel doers 
and suffre not passyng euel doers alyue. 
Also he schulde oponliche louye good men 
and do hem worschip, 
for in p a t wise he schal best brynge al p e puple pat is vnder hem 
to be ritfol and vertuous. 
r Pe fifte, 
it is semelich to kynges and princes to recche not 
þey pey be preysed among men, 
for þei p a t ben set in dignité 
hauen many flaterers 
þat teilen tales 
p a t bien likyng to hem; 
and gif pey trowen suche flaterers, 
it happeth hem to wirche 
not after resoun and lawe 
but after passioun and wille. 
Panne kynges and princes 
and al p a t bien in dignité schulde so moche pe lasse recche of preysynge of men, 
in so moche as pey hauen pe mo flaterers 
p a t fonde}} 
to peruerte hem 
w i p flateryng and preysyng. 
Pe sixte, 
for kynges and princes schulde be suffisaunt to hemsilf 
in outward good and catel, 
as it schal be declared 
in pe fcridde book 
p e r e we schal trete of reulyng of règnes, 
it is not semelich to hem to make here mone and to praye iftes of outward good and catel. 
Panne alle pe propretees 
p a t bien assigned schal accorde 
and be semlich to kynges and princes. 
Wherfore it is semelich 
p a t eche of hem be magnanimus. Chapter XXIV 
Men louen worschep 
and ben som tyme iblamed 
and som tyme ipraysed 
as pe philosofer | wol mené, iiii Ethicorum. 
For we blamen f. som men p a t teilen 
þat pey recchen not 
of here owne worschep, 
and also for we blame som men 
p a t desiren moch worschip, 
a[nd] we prise som men p a t recette}) 
not of here owne worschep. 
Pan recche of propre worschip 
is to preysyng 
in on manere 
and to blamyng in ano^er maner, 
for som men recche}) 
not of worschep for p 
e i wolde 
not do workes and dedes worthi worschep 
and is perfore to blame. 
Pan we schul [recche] of worchep 
and not desire to gret worschep 
no})er sette oure fynal entent in worschep, 
but we schal do werkes 
and dedus worþ worschep. 
And workes 
wor})y worschep may be take in twey wyse: 
o p e r as p e i ben proporcionat to vs, 
o p e r as p e i ben 
worJ}y gret worschep. 
As in spendyng and cost bien twey vertues: liberalitas, 
p a t stonde}} 
in mené spendyng and cost 
as it is proporcionat to vs; 
and magnificencia, 
p a t stondeþ 
in greet spendyng and cost in so moche 
as it is greet and strecchet to gret workes; 
so in honour and worschep stonden twey vertues: 
oon p a t stondeþ 
in mené worschep 
and as it is proporciónate to vs 
(and p i s vertue hatte honoris amatiua, 
as pe philosofer menéþ), 
and anoþer vertue p a t stondeþ 
in gret honour and worschep as magnanimitas. 
Pan pe same workes may be workes of o p e r vertues as of magnanimitas also. 
For he p a t d o p workes and dedis 
of fortitudo 
and putteþ him to fyte, 
if he d o p so 
for he hap likyng in suche dedis, 
p a n he is fortis; 
and gif he d o p so 
for suche dedes 
ben worthi gret worschep, 
þanne he is magnanimus. 
Also gif he d o p werkes of chastite for likynge 
p a t he hath gerinne, þanne he is chaste and temporate; 
and v gif he d o p suche werkes for p 
e i bien worthi greet worschep, 
þanne he is magnanimus. 
Perfore pe propre mater of magnanimitas 
is not dedes of werre and of bataille 
n o p e r perel - 
but suche dedes ben pe mater of fortitudo - 
noþer delicate kynges sensible and likynge, 
for gerinne stondeþ temporancia. 
But pe proper | mater of magnanimitas 
is honour and col. worschep; 
for al p a t magnanimus doþ, 
he d o p it 
for it is worthi gret worschip. Panne as it is iseid, iiii Ethicorum, 
magnanimitas is a certeyn ornate and highnesse of al vertues. 
For [as] magnanimus dolp þe workes of libéralité 
in most excellent manere, 
so magnanimitas is a sertein ornate and higghnesse of alle vertues, 
for workis of alle vertuis 
ben worþi honour and worchep; 
wherfor magnanimus dolp þe workes of alle vertues. 
Perfore it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
p a t it longeth not to magnanimus to fie hym 
þat warneth hym, 
þat is þe dede of prudencia: 
noþer it longeth hym to do vnrigt þat longeth iniusticia. 
Panne magnanimus doþ werkis of o p e r vertues and dolp hem excellentlich. 
Pan [for] amonge outward good 
worschep is excellent good, 
he p a t doun werkis of vertuis for p e i ben worþi honour and worschip, 
dolp suche workes [þe more] excellentliche 
þa[n] gif he dide suche workes 
for delectacioun and likynge 
þat he hath gerinne. 
Panne it is wel seid Ipat magnanimitas makeþ al most vertues, 
and it is iseid Ipat he makeþ hem aile parfit and higteth hem also; 
for by magnanimité we doun þe dedes of alle vertues 
þe more excellentliche, 
þe more manerliche, 
and higtliche, and parfitliche. 
For it is declared what is magnanimitas 
and how it hath itsilf to o^ere vertues, 
it is sone iknowe 
which is þe vertue 
of þe whiche now we schal trete: 
p a t vertue hatte honoris amatiua. 
For as þe same workes 
may be þe workis 
of o p e r vertuis and of magnanimitate, 
so pe same workis may be pe workis 
of o p e r vertuis 
and of pe vertue 
p a t hatte honoris amatiua 
by pe whiche vertue we louen honour and worschep. 
And workes of o p e r e vertues bien worthi greet honour and worschep 
p a t perteyneth to magnanimité; 
but as p e i bien proporciónate to vs 
and to mené honour and worschip, 
he perteyneth to þe vertue 
p a t | hatte f. honoris amatiua, 
as it were loue and desire of worschep. 
Panne as it is semelich 
p a t a kyng o p e r a prince be magnificus and liberalis, 
so it is semelich p a t he be magnanimus 
and loue and desire honoure and worschep 
and is garnie icleped honoris amatiua. 
For it is semelich p a t kynges and princes loue and desire honoure and worschep 
in pe manere and wise 
as it is iseide 
so p a t he loue and desire to do workes 
p a t bien worthi honoure and worschep. 
For it semeth p a t p i s vertu honoris amatiua 
is to magnanimité 
[as] formositas of body is to pulcritudo. 
For gif litel men 
in here membris and lemes 
whan here lemes ben proporciónate 
and acordyng ben formosi, schaplich, 
but not pulcri 
(for pulcritudo, fairnesse, 
is not but in a gret body), 
so he p a t r doþ workes 
þat ben worthi mené honour and worschep - such oon is cleped honoris amatiuus 
and is propreliche icleped magnanimus 
whan he doþ workes 
þat bien worthy gret honour and worschep. 
Panne for a kyng oþer a prince doþ no foul dede in grete nedes noþer in mené, 
but doþ alwey workes 
þat ben worthi gret honour and worschep, 
it is wel seid 
þat a kyng oþer a prince haue fcis vertue honoris amatiua 
and be honoris amatiuus. 
But we vseth fcis name pulcritudo 
for al maner fairenesse, 
formositas for semlich schap. Chapter XXV The philosofer, iiii Ethicorum, 
clepeth hym þat putteþ hymself meneliehe to worschep not magnanimus but temporatus. 
Panne for temporatenus 
in worschep is humilitas, mekenesse, 
þe vertue 
þat þe philosofer clepeth honoris amatiua stondefc 
in mené worschep 
and may fcerfore, 
as it semeth, 
be icleped humilitas. 
But gif we seyn so þat, 
| som doutes may arise; 
for ech magnanimus col. 
is honoris amatiuus 
and loueth and desireth honour and worschip, 
and eche magnificus is liberalis. 
Wherfore gif honoris amatiua 
is a certeyn humilité, mekenesse, 
þanne ech magnanimus is humilis, meke, 
and þat semeth contrarie to itself. 
For humilis, 
he þat is meke, 
doþ reuerence to oþere and as it is seid, iiii Ethicorum, 
magnanimus despiseth oþere. 
Perfore it is to wetynge þat but omnis magnanimus 
were humilis, meke, 
we geueth not to lordes 
and to princes couenable doctrine and lore; 
for gif it were so, 
we scholde teche hem to be withoute vertues. 
For withoute humilité no man may haue vertues 
at þe folle. 
Panne for to declare þe sothnesse 
it is to declarynge þat wifcoute humilité 
no man may be magnanimus. 
Magnanimitas and humilité 
and suche vertues morale stondefc in passions of þe soule. 
For in so moche þat þei ben icleped vertues, 
% þei reulen vs to goode by resoun 
and moderateth oure passions 
þat we go not out of þe weye fram þe good of resoun. 
But passions maken vs go out of þe weye 
þat ledefc to good of reson, 
as it is iseid tofore hond, 
and þat may happe in twey maner wise. 
Furste, 
for passions makefc vs inclined 
to do agenst resoun. 
Pe second, 
for passions wifcdraweth vs 
and lettefc vs to do as resoun wolde. 
Wherfore for passiouns inclineth vs to do agenst resoun, 
vs nedefc a vertue to withdrawe vs, 
as it fareth of temporancia 
þat withdraweth vs fro sencible delectacioun and likynge. 
But whan passions withdrawith and lettifc vs to do as resoun wolde, 
vs nedith not a vertu to wifcdrawe 
but vs nedith a vertu 
to excite vs and conforte, 
as it fareth of fortitudo 
þat exciteth and conforteth 
vs to peril of bataille 
and | of werre more [þan] 
f. it withdraweth vs fcerfro. 
v Panne for withdrawyng and excityng 
bien som del contrarie and formaliche dyuerse, 
þe same vertue is not principaliche 
of itself withdrawyng and excityng, 
noþer þe same vertue 
is principaliche moderatynge passions 
and excitynge vs to do agenst resoun and lettynge vs to do as resoun axeth. 
Panne perfore it is 
})at gif þe same 
})yng itake diuersliche wi^draweth [vs] and excite}), 
it nedef) gerinne to haue twey vertues, 
on excityng and on oþer withdrawyng. 
And we seeth ^at magnanimitas stondej 
in gret worschep, 
and gret worschep 
in som wise is gret gode; 
and greet good, 
by cause þat it is greet, 
letted vs and withdraweþ vs þat we pursewe it not 
by cause of difficulté. 
And for it is good, 
it ex[c]itith us and drawen vs to fonde for to com þerto. 
Pan in gret honour and worschip and in greet good it happeth to faile in twey maner wise: first, gif we fondeJD more p 
a n we scholde for to come 
þerto for it is good; 
þe second, gif we draweth vs þerfro more 
þan resoun wolde by cause of difficulté. 
Wherfore in suche doynge vs nedeþ tweye vertues: 
oon Ipat exciteþ vs and conforteþ Ipat we withdrawe vs not 
by cause of difficulté [and 
})is vertue hatte magnanimitas]; 
and a n o j D 
e r pat withdraweth vs pat we fonde not more 
þan resoun wolde for to come 
þerto by cause þat it is good, 
and pis vertue hatte humilitas. 
And eche magnanimus is humilis, 
for it is inpossible 
to be magnanimus and nouth good 
as þe philosofer preueth, 
iiii Ethicorum. 
No man is good gif he fondeþ to come to worschep passyng þat resoun axeth. 
Bot [for] nedelich magnanimitas 
exciteth vs to fonde to come 
to som grete good 
þat we be not withdrawe 
by cause of difficulté, 
it nedeþ þat humilitee be anexed 
p e r i o þa[t] we | fonde not more 
þan resoun axeth 
by cause of þe good- col. nesse, 
ellis magnanimus were vicious. 
Men may desire greet honour and worschip 
and greet good bolpe 
by magnanimité and humilité, 
but not by þe same cause and resoun. 
For whan man desireth worschip and honour and greet good 
and is not withdrawe by cause of difficulté, 
þanne he is magnanimus; 
but for he desireth not passynge pat resoun axeth, 
he is humilis. 
Magnanimitas and humilité ben diuerse in twey wise. First, 
for magnanimitas exciteþ principaliche 
and wiþdraweth 
by þe consequent folwyng. 
Perfore it is iseid 
þat magnanimus dispiseth oþere, 
and not for he doþ hem viciousliche wrong, 
but for he is so greet of herte 
and so excited by þe vertue 
þat hym is leuere dispise workes and wordes of men 
þan leue perfore workes and dedes. 
And humilitas dolp agenward and wiþdraweth principalliche and exciteth 
by þe consequent folwynge. 
Perfore it is iseid 
þat humilité doþ reuerence to olpere 
for he seelp olper defaute 
p a n his owne in lefful bynges and honest and doþ reuerence to olpere. 
Pe seconde, pes vertues ben diuerce, 
for magnanimitas principalliche moderateþ 
whanhope and vntrist 
þat man be not wiþdrawe 
by cause of difficulté to leue 
and to spare workes 
þat ben worthi gret worschip. 
And humilitas moderate]? principaliche hope and trist for man schulde not haue to greet hope and trist 
ndper fonde to gete of þat goode greet worschep more þan resoun axeth. 
Panne magnanimus is humilis 
in þe manere 
as it is iseid, 
and humilitas is in sum wise mené honoris amatiua; 
for he is cleped humilis 
þat moderateþ hope 
and trist of wynnyng and comynge to greet honour and worschip 
and is menliche inclyned to suche honour | 
and worschep. f. 
And whether it be al oon 
to be humilis 
and to loue and desire 
mené honour and worschip, olper gif humilitas 
is þe same vertue 
pat þe philosofer distynguyth 
fram magnanimité 
and clepeth it honoris amatiua, 
it longeth not to þis doyng. 
But if it happeth vs to make more in moral mater 
we schal declare Ipat Ipat vertue honoris amatiua 
of þe whiche þe philosofre spekij? 
is not in alle wyse þe same vertue p a t is humilité. 
For p i l k e of þe which þe philosofer spekiþ [pat] incliniþ, 
as it is iseide, 
to men[e] honour and worschip, 
is in p e appetite sensitif, 
and humilitas in þe appetite intellectif. 
r Chapter XXVI By p a t is iseid it is declared p a t humilitas and magnanimitas 
ben diuerse vertues; 
for Ipei þe same vertue abate superfluite and moderateþ lacke and défaut, 
et neuere pis tweyne may longe liehe principaliche to þe same vertue. 
Panne to magnanimité it longeth to abate wanhope and despoire 
p a t we be not 
in despeyre of greet good Ipat we desiren, 
and þeito it longeth 
to moderate hope 
and trist pat we fonde not more 
p a n resoun wolde to come to soche good, 
and dolp not e i p e r liehe principallich. 
For by cause pat magnanimus fondeþ to haue greet good and worschep, 
þe vertue magnanimitas exciteþ vs more to greet doynge 
p a n it withdraweth vs ]}erfram. 
Panne magnanimitas abateþ despeyr more principallich Ipat we wij^drawe vs not fram greet doyng, 
and by þe consequent folwynge it moderateth hope and trist Ipat we fonde not to do grete doyng aenst resoun; 
and humilitas dolp aenward 
as it is iseid tofore. 
Wherfore by cause Ipat pes twey vertues ben diuerse, 
it is to wetyng what maner | vertue is Ipat vertue Ipat is iclepede humilitas. col. Wherfore it is to wetyng Ipat 
as touchyng magnanimité 
it happeth to do to muche olper t o lite, 
and so it fareth of humilité; 
for as it is iseid magnanimitas 
is a vertue pat exciteth and conforteþ vs pat we be not wiþdrawe 
by cause of difficulté fram workes 
þat ben worthi greet worschep. 
Panne gerinne som men passeth 
as presumptuous men and fonde}} 
more p a n he schulde to do grete workes and dedes, 
and summe failleth as pusillanimus. 
Perfore magnanimitas 
is mené bytwene presumpcioun and pusillanimitas. 
Also it is declared pat humilitas 
is a vertue þat wifcdraweth vs þat we fonde not 
by cause of goodnesse and likynge 
þat is in dedes of worschip 
and of bataille to do agenst resoun. 
Panne herinne som men passen as proude men 
þat fondefc to haue excellent worschip more þan he scholde; 
and som failen in settyng hemself 
lowere þan he scholde, 
as thilke þat axeth no worschep 
noþer doþ dedes þat ben worthi worschep, 
and þat is not doyng of humilité 
but of violence and wrecchednesse. 
Panne humilitas is mené bytwene pruyde 
and wreched lownesse and magnanimitas 
is mené bytwene presumpcioun and pusillanimitas. 
For it is declared what is humilitas, 
it may be sone iknowe 
where inne it stondefc; 
for humilis settefc his entent 
to abate pruyde 
and moderate deieccioun 
and wrecched lownesse. 
Panne humilitas stondefc in pruyde 
and in deieccioun, 
wrecched lownesse, 
but not ileche principalliche; 
for humilitas abateth pruyde principalliche 
and moderatefc deieccioun 
by þe consequent folwynge. 
Panne it is notabeliche to wetyng þat [whan] a vertue is more withdrawynge 
þan | excityng, 
it is principalliche contrarie to superfluite and f. passinge 
by þe whiche we bien excited, 
and by þe consequent folwyng 
it is contrarie to þe defaute in lakke by þe whiche we bien wifcdrawe. 
But whan a vertue is more excityng 
þan wifcdrawyng, 
þan it is agenward; 
for þanne it is principaliche contrarie 
to þe defaute 
to þe whiche we ben withdrawe 
and is by þe consequent folwynge contrarie to þe excellent hon[or]ys 
by þe whiche we bien excited. 
Panne for magnanimitas 
is a vertue excityng to greet doynge and deficulte, 
it is more contrarie to pusillanimitas 
þat is a defaute, 
wifcdrawyng vs in suche doynge, 
þan it is contrarie to presumpcioun, 
þat is excellent and passyng, 
excityng vs to do suche doyng. 
But humilitas doþ agenward, 
for it is a vertue wifcdrawyng vs þat we passe not reson 
in fondyng to haue excellentnesse wis and worschip. 
It is principalliche contrarie to pruyde 
þat passeth 
in suche doyng and dedes 
and by þe consequent folwynge 
it is contrarie to deieccioun, 
wrecched lownesse. 
Perfore in workes 
þat bien worthi honour and worschip it happeth to faille 
and to do amys not onliche 
by pruyde bute deieccioun, 
wrecched lownesse. 
For gif a man loweth hymself notablich more þan his staat axet and agenste reson, 
he is deiectus and foule and beste for he knoweth not his owne astaat; 
oþer he is prout and bostere, 
forfcerbysomme fondeth 
to gete excellentnesse 
and bost and presyng and loweth hymself more þan he schulde. 
Perfore þe philosofer, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
clepeth certeyn men of Grees proute and bosters, 
and befc Latomences; 
and he clepefc hem proute and bosters, 
% for passyng [þat] here astaat 
axeth,fceywere iclofced | 
in foule clothing col. 
and vnworthi and trowede fcerby 
to haue sum worschip 
and to be holde excellent. 
And so fcere it is wrete þat in passynge doyng 
and in greet defaute and faillynge 
is bost and pruyde. 
v o For it is declared where inne humilitas stondej 
(for it stondej principalliche in abatyng of pruyde 
and by pe consequent folwynge 
in moderatyng of deieccioun, 
wrecched lownesse), 
it is to declarynge 
p a t it is semelich 
p a t kynges and princes haue p i s vertue; 
and p a t we may preue be twey weyes. 
Pe firste is itake by magnanimitas; 
pe seconde, by doynge and dedes. 
For it is iseid tofore 
p a t no man is verrey magnanimus 
but he be good and humilis, meke, 
and p a t alwey humilitas 
is anexed to magnanimitas, 
wherfore, gif it is semeliche p a t p 
e i haue pe vertue magnanimío itas, 
it is semelich p a t p 
e i haue pe vertue humilitas. 
For kynges and princes schulde so fonde to do workes 
worthi honour and worschip 
not passynge resoun 
but as it is accordynge to here astaat as he d o p p 
a t bien humilis, meke, and þat p 
e i schulle not sette here felicite in excellentnesse and worschip 
as proute men d o p . 
For he schulde do good workes 
and worthi honour 
and worschip 
by cause of good p a t cometh þerof so p 
a t he passe not here owne astaat 
to be iholde excellent. 
Pe seconde, it is semeliche p 
a t a kyng o p e r a prince be humilis 
by cause of dedes p 
a t he schal do, 
for a proud man wolde more p 
a n he schulde be iholde excellent 
and takeþ ofte 
vppon hym dedes p 
a t passeth his owne myt and strengthe. 
Perfore it is semelich p a t man be meke so p 
a t he take heede 
of his owne astaat, 
of his owne proper faculte, 
and takeþ not vppon hym more þan he scholde. 
For ofte a proude man | more p a n reson axeth desireth 
to be excellent and put- f. 
teth hymself and oþere to peril more p a n he scholde 
and may not brynge to good ende dedes 
p a t he bygynneth. 
Panne pe worse it is to putte pe comune good [in] peril, 
pe more besiliche kynges 
and princes scholde forsake and putte away pruyde. 
For comynliche a proud lord putteþ pe puple to perel. Chapter XXVII 
After p a t we hauen determined of vertues p a t stondeþ 
in outward good and ischewed how kynges and princes schulde be highed 
w i p thilke virtues, 
it is to spekynge 
of pe vertue mansuetudo 
p a t stondeþ 
in outward euel and harm. 
For it is seid tofore 
p a t wherinne it euer be 
p a t p e i happen to do yuele or wel, 
it happeþ to passe o p e r t o faille and to do lite, 
p a r e mot be som vertue 
by pe whiche we bien irewled to do wel, 
moderatynge passyng doyng and abatyng scarsete and defaute. 
And in takynge wreche of outward euel and harm p 
a t o p e r e men d o p , 
som men passeth 
as wrethful men p 
a t desiriþ to gret wre[che]. 
For w r e p comij) 
here of for we desire 
wre[che] and ponisching; 
and sum while man strongliche desiriþ wretche], 
is blood hetij) 
aboute pe herte, 
and he w e x i p wroth. 
Pan sum men bien wrethful and passeth in takyng wreche 
o p e r 
in desirynge wreche, 
and som men ben not wrethfol and r l e t e p al wrong passe; 
and ner n o p e r herof is good. 
For to be wrooþ 
to ech man 
and to axe wreche of al thyng is euel 
and to blame as wrethful men d o p . 
Also neuer be wroth and neuere axe 
wreche in no wise 
is not to presynge, 
for it is to doyng agenst resoun. 
For resoun wol p a t sum punycioun be ydo; 
and p a t it is to doynge 
þat man be wrooþ 
to wham he scholde 
and as moche as he scholde. 
For to be wrooth in place and tyme, 
it is a worke of vertue; 
wher|fore gif it happeth to passe and to col. faille in pe passions of wreche 
and in desiryng wreche, 
per mot be a vertue 
to abate suche passyng desire and moderatynge 
pe defaute of suche desire 
gif it is to ligte; 
and þis vertue is mansuetudo. 
And so it is declared 
what is mansuetudo; 
for as fortitudo is mené 
bytwene drede and hardinesse, 
so mansuetudo is mené betwene wrethe, 
by pe whiche we desiren wreche, 
and pe contrarie of wrathe, 
p a t hatte inirascibilitas, 
by pe whiche we forgeueþ yuel and harme 
p a t is ido to vs. 
Also he is mitis 
p a t desireth not wreche of al thinges 
noþer failleth 
by so moche of punicioun 
p a t he wolde in none wise 
p a t men were ipunysched, 
but also he fo[r]geueth som tyme 
and ponyscheth som tyme 
by ordre of resoun. 
Wherfore as fortitudo abateth drede and moderateth hardynesse 
so mansuetudo abated 
wrethe and moderateth 
pe contrarie 
p a t hatte inirascibilitas. 
For it is declared 
what is mansuetudo 
it may be sone iknowe 
where inne it stondeþ; 
for it stondeþ 
as it is iseid in wreþþe 
and in the contrary of wrethe 
p a t hatte inirascibilitas; 
but it stondeþ principalliche in wrethe. 
For mansuetudo principalliche abateþ wrethe, 
and by pe consequent folwyng it moderateþ passions contrarie to wrethe, 
for it is kyndelich to vs to desire 
wreche of euel and harm 
þat is ido to vs. 
Also for mannys owne harm 
may vnnethe be so lite 
but it seme hym p a t it is moche, 
not onliche we ben inclined to ponysche hem 
p a t don vs harm 
but also it is kyndelich to vs to desire more wreche p a n pe harm axeth. 
For pe harm p a t is ido 
to vs semeth 
to vs more p a n it is and so we desiren to take more wreche of hem 
p a t doun vs to harm p a n pe harme axeth. 
Panne it is difficultee | 
to abate wrethe and not desire wreche of f. wronges more p a n reson axeth. 
Panne manye fayleth 
and maken defaute desiryng to moche wreche and fewe trespasseth 
and failleth in desyryng to lite wreche. 
Perfore gif a vertue stondeþ in good and in difficulté, 
mansuetudo is principalich contraríe to wrethe 
and is by pe consequent 
fo[l]wynge contrarie to inirascibilite 
p a t is contrarie to wrethe and moderateth inirascibilite 
and p a t is knowe 
by pe name mansuetudo. 
For gif we taken heede and knoweth 
pe name mansuetudo, 
it is pe name of temperament of wrethe. 
And p a t [it] is semelich 
p a t kynges and princes haue þiS vertue mansuetudo 
it is not hard to declare. 
For by cause p a t wrethe peruertej} 
pe v dom of resoun, 
it is not semelich þat kynges and princes ben wret[h]ful for principalliche 
in hem scholde be greet resoun and vnderstondyng. 
For as we seeth gif þe tonge be infecte 
wiþ colera oþer wiþ oþere humores, 
we demen not arigt of sauours; 
so gif þe appetite is infecte 
by inmoderate wrethe oþer 
by inmoderate passions, 
oure dom of resoun 
is peruerted and apeyred. 
Pan gif it is inconuenient 
þat þe reule be peruerted, 
myswend and croked, 
þe kyng þat scholde be 
as it were þe merour 
and ensample of leuyng and reule of dedes and doynge, 
it is inconuenient 
þat he be wrethful 
lest he be peruerted and myswend by wrethe. 
Also gif he were in none wise wrethful and in none wise imeued to take wreche, 
it were vnsemliche; 
for gif no ponyschyng 
were ido noþer wreche itake in þe regne, 
men wold be wrongful 
and do wrong 
to oþere men and þanne policie 
ne mygte not dure ‡. 
Panne no man scholde be wroth for hate 
noþer desire ponyssioun for hate. 
But it is to be wroth 
by cause of loue | 
and of good wille; 
col. 
and so ponyssion scholde be desired for loue and for good wille. 
For ponyschioun schulde be desired for loue of rigtwisnesse 
oþer for loue of þe comune profit, 
for fcerwithoute þe comyn profite may not dure. 
Wherfore gif a man were so mylde 
þat hym were leuere let rigt persche þan to tak wreche, 
he were not vertuous. 
Panne þe more it longefc to kynges and princes to kepe and saue rigt 
and þe comyn profit, 
þe more semelich it is to hem 
þat [þei] ben meued to do ponyschyng 
and take wreche. 
Wherfore þei kynges scholde not be wrethfol, 
þei scholde be meued 
by þe ordre of resoun 
to do ponyschyng 
and take wreche. 
And for mansuetudo doth so, 
it is semelich to a kynge be mansuetus. Chapter XXVIII 
As þis work axeth we hauen sufficientlich ispoke of vertues 
þat stondeþ 
in good of itself 
and of vertues 
þat stonden in outward euel and harme. 
Now it is to spekyng of vertues 
þat stondeþ in outward good 
as we comuneth with oþere 
in wordes and in dedes. 
And wordes and dedes 
in þe whiche we comuneth wiþ oþere se[r]uen vs to þre: 
to frendschip, to sothnesse, 
and to murfce, likynge and pleig. 
For in þat we comuneth wiþ 
oþere þe whiche in wordes and dedes worschipynge hem in fonggyng hem 
þat we may be frendlich and affabilis. 
Panne amicabilitas and affabilitas 
of þe whiche we schal speke heere is nougt ellis 
but haue rigt conuersacioun 
wiþ oþere and ordeyne oure wordes 
and dedes to theu conuersacioun. 
Pe seconde, oure wordes 
and dedes serueth vs to sothnesse, 
for þerby we ben idemed whiche we ben. 
And to sothnesse 
and to verite of þe whiche we speken of here 
is nougt elles 
but þat a man be not a bostere, 
so þat he make not bost of hymself passynge his wordes and dedes, 
and | so þat he be not a scornere, 
noþer despise in wordes 
and f. r dedes, 
noþer schewe hymself vnworthy in wordes and dedes passyng resoune, 
but pat he be trewe and oponliche iknowe suche as he is. 
Pe þridde, wordes and dedes 
may be ordeyned to game and likynge and murþe 
so p a t a man be in p 
e w manere merie. 
Panne as it is iseid 
tofore in wordes and dedes in p 
e whiche we comuneth 
w i p o p e r e stondej p r e vertues: ‡amicabilitas, pat hath anoþer name 
and may be cleped affabilitas; Veritas, 
pat is cleped apericio also; 
and debita iocunditas, 
pat is cleped eutrapelia of p e philosofer. 
Panne in comenyng 
w i p oþere, 
gif we wol haue good conuersacioun, 
we schul be 
J)ewliche iocunde, veraces and amicabiles; 
of alle pese we schul speke. 
But first of amicabilite, 
as it were frenschipe: 
for we seep p a t in communicacioun 
WÍþ oþere somme passeth, 
for a schewiþ hymself to amicabiles, 
to frendeliche, 
and suche ben plesyng men and flaterers 
and scheweth hemself 
so communicatif and felowlich pat p e i wollen no man greue but preyseth al wordes and dedes of o p e r e men. 
And somme agenward lacken to moche 
of pis conuersacioun for þei ben trewauntis (discoli) and agrestes (solutarie) 
and may not haue conuersacioun 
w i p opere; 
and eyper fallen of rigt resoun, 
for a man schal not schewe hymself to o p e r e so felowlich p 
a t he be holde plesynge and flatere, 
noþer he schal so moche wiþdrawe hym out of felowschipe 
pat he be holde discolus (froward), contrarie and stryuere. 
Panne for a vertue is mené 
bytwene to moche and to lite, 
p e r mot be som vertue abatynge 
what is to moche and moderatyng 
what is to lite; 
and þÍS vertue is amicabilitas 
and hatte affabilitas also. 
For affabilitas, 
pat is vertue, 
is not elles but mené beryng in | conuersacioun of men so col. 
pat we passe not in suche conuersacioun 
as flaterers doun 
noþer faille 
and do to luyte in conuersacioun 
as stryuers and froward schrewes doun. 
For it is isey 
what is amicabilitas, 
as we speketh p e r o i heere 
at þÍS tyme 
(for it is a vertue abatyng stryf and moderatyng plesyng as p 
e philosofer menéþ, 
ii and iiii Ethicorum), 
it may sone be iknowe 
where inne it stondeþ: 
for it stondeþ 
in wordes and dedes as p 
e i ben ordeyned to p 
e w conuersacioun in p 
e lif of mankynde. 
For gif a man is kyndeliche sociale beste and componable 
as it is preued, primo Poleticorum, it nedeþ, 
in dedes and wordes in p 
e whiche me comyneth 
w i p oþere, 
to haue som vertue by p 
e whiche men may haue good co[n]uersacioun. 
Wherfore right resoun wol mené p a t by diuersete of persones conuersacioun schal be diuers. 
Pey alle men p a t wol leue in pollici and comynte schulde be amycabiles and affabiles, 
frendlich and good to speke wiþ, 
noþeles not alle men ben, 
noJ)er schulde be, amicabiles in p e same wise. 
For by cause p a t to grete homelichnesse 
is cause of dispisyng of worschep, 
kynges and princes schulde bere hemself more sadliche þan 
o p e r men, 
and for to haue p e more worschip and reuerence, 
and for p e dignité of a kyng schulde not be despised 
noJ)er litel itold of. Perfore, v Poleticorum, 
pe philosofer geueth cautels of kynges and princes and seip 
þat it is semelich 
p a t kynges and princes 
be iseye among reuerent persones 
lest p e i be despised 
o p e r litel itold of. 
For as it fareth in takynge of mete 
and in oþere dedes, 
rigt resoun meneþ 
p a t by diuersete of persones 
pe dedes schal be diuerse, 
for som mete is to moche for a seek man 
p a t is to lite for an hool man. 
And so it fareth in conuersacioun of men. 
For som homlichnesse is acounted a vertue in a kyng 
and is perfore iclepede | amicabilis; 
and gif a mené f. persone were not more homlich, 
in hym it scholde be acounted a vice 
and not a vertue; 
and he schulde not be cleped amicabilis, frendlich, 
but siluestris, boynard. v Chapter XXIX 
As in conuersacioun in lif it happeth to passe 
and to faille 
as it is iseide, 
so in verite it happeþ to passe 
and to faille for Veritas stondeþ 
in a certeyn euenesse. 
Pan he p a t seith more p a n it is passeth verite 
and he þat seith lasse and denyeth 
pe sothe failleth of verite. 
Wherfore by cause 
þat lesyng is of itsilf worthi to be forsake, 
as it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
p e i p a t bien not soth seyers noþer apert nojser schewe| hemsilf such as p 
e i bien - þei ben to blame. 
For it is a maner lesynge 
to be not apert 
and not shewe hymself suche as he is. 
Panne fram p i s verite 
by pe whiche man scheweth hymselue trewe and oponliche suche as he is, 
som men gon out of þe weye and passeth verite and scheweth of hemsilf in word and in dede grettere dedes p a n p e i doun and makeþ hemself grettere p a n p 
e i ben and suche bien icleped iaccatores, bosters. 
And somme faillen of þÍS verite by defaute and feyneth of hemsilf 
sum what p a t p 
e i hauen not as sum vnworthi thing, 
o p e r hauen som what and denyeth þat p e i hauen it, 
and þe philosofer clepeth suche men irrones in Grewe and ben i c l e p d irrisores and despectores in Latyn, scorners and despisers. 
Panne nedeth som vertue mené 
by pe whiche þe defaute 
may be moderate 
and ouerpassyng abated, 
and by þe comyn name p 
i s vertue is cleped Veritas. 
Panne it is iknowe what is Veritas 
for it is a vertue moderatynge despisyng and abatyng bost. 
For it is iknowe 
what is veri 
|tas it is to knowynge 
wherinne it stond- col. ejx Wherfore it is to wetynge þat p 
e i a man graunte of hymsilf oþer wise p 
a n it is o p 
e r denyeth pe sothe as it is, 
þanne he Hep; natheles he may wiþoute lesyng telle sum of pe sothe and nougt alle. 
Panne he þat wol be veray schal not feyne of hymsilf goodnesse 
p a t he hath not noþer graunty in hymsilf malice 
þat he troweth not þat be in hymsilf. 
Nathales it nedeth not to telle of hymself 
alle þe godnesse 
þat he knoweth of hymself; 
for p e i no man scholde lige, 
git Veritas, pe sope, 
is not to tellyng alwey and euery whare. 
For in place and tyme we may be resoun be stille 
and not telle þe sothe. 
Panne Veritas abateþ bostynge and moderateth despisyng 
but not ileche principaliche; 
but Veritas is principalliche contrarie 
to bostynge and abateth boystyng, 
and is by þe consequent folwyng contrarie to despisyng and moderateth dispisyng. 
Perfore, iiii Ethicorum, capitulo De Veritate, 
þe philosofer seith þat drawynge to þe lasse and preyse his owne 
dedes lasse 
þan þei ben worthi is doyng of hym þat is prudens. 
Panne it longeth to hym þat is verax 
in no wise for to preyse hymsilf 
and his dedes more þan þei bien worthi 
as many men doþ. 
For many grauntefc grete goodes of hymself and 
benfcerwithoute;and byhoteth frendschipe to hym þat he knoweth and greet good and heelp and doþ fcerof lite oþer rigt nougt in dede; 
and suche bien bosters 
and not apert noþer veraces, 
soth seyers. 
In suche doynge | 
it is in no wise to passynge f. 
in þe more 
but it is rather to drawyng to þe lasse, 
so þat no lesynge be maad noþer passynge notabliche fram þe mené; 
for gif he passeth notabliche fro þe mené, 
in þat he semeth not verax but derisor, 
scorner and dispiser. 
So as gif a man 
were so strong and staleworthe 
þat it were iknowe þat he mygte fighte agenst an hundred men, 
gif he wolde seye hymself 
þat he mygt nougt figte 
but oonlich with on wrecche, 
þanne al þat h[ym] herde wolde knowe þat he scornede. 
Perfore fcerof þe name 
is itake ironie and derisionis, scornyng, 
whan a man preyseth hymsilf 
and his dedes notabliche lasse þan þei ben worth. 
Panne Veritas moderateth suche scornyng 
and abateth bostyng, 
but it abateth bostyng mo[re] principalliche þan it moderateth scornynge. 
For as it is iseid, 
in suche doyng me schal drawe more 
to þe lasse þan to þe more, 
and preyse hymself 
and his dedes rafcer lasse þan fcey ben worth, 
þanne he schal passe and preyse hymself 
and his dedes more 
þan fcey ben worthi. 
And we may assyngne twey causes whi in suche doyng man 
schal drawe to þe lasse: 
þe firste is take 
by his owne persone; 
þe secunde is itake by oþer men. 
For eche man loueth kyndelich his owne good 
þat alwey he weneth 
þat it is more worthi 
þan it is. 
Perfore comonliche men bien deseyued of hemself 
and weneth þat þei ben more worfci þan þei ben. 
Also in talkynge of propre good 
and dedes it is alwey to drawynge to þe lasse, 
for we schal trowe 
þat we louen oure owne good 
and weneth þat it be bettre þan it is. 
And þe philosofer toucheth fcis resoun in þe auctorite 
þat is seid toforehand; 
for he seith þat prudens | 
schal drawe to þe col. lasse, 
for it is greet prudencia and redinesse 
for a man 
to know hymsilf 
and to wete 
þat his owne good semeth 
bettre þan it is. 
Pe seconde resoun is itake by oþer men, 
for þey þat drawen not to þe lasse preyseth hemself 
and maketh bost of good 
þat thei hauen not. 
And for comonliche suche bosters 
þat preysen hemself 
ben noyfol to oþer men, 
‡ þerfore by cause of oþere men 
it is semelich in suche r doyng to drawe 
to þe lasse pat mon be not noyous to oþere men. 
Pe philosofer toucheth þÍS resoun, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
þere a seiþ 
þat me schal drawe 
to þe lasse for passyng 
bostyng is noyfol. 
It is declared what is Veritas 
of pe whiche we speketh here 
and where inne it stondeþ. 
It may be sone iknowe pat 
it is semelich 
to eche kyng and prince to be verax. 
For þei pat drawen notabliche 
to þe lasse and preyseth hemsilf 
and here dedes notabliche lasse worþ, 
pan pei semen scorners 
and bien despised. 
And þei þat bien notabliche and preysen hemsilf, here good, 
and here dedes notabelich 
more þan pei ben worþ, 
ben bosters and noyfol. 
Wherfore gif 
it is semeliche pat kynges and princes 
ben not despised but worschepped, 
noþer noyful but gracious and worthi to be loued, 
it is semelich þat pei be not bosters 
noþer scorners 
but apert and veraces, 
and not bostynge of hemsilf 
and of here dedes more pan pey ben worþ, noþer byhotynge to oþere men more pan he wol leste. 
But pe more men exciten hem in bostyng 
and of þe more pat 
pey mowe make bost, 
pe more semelich it is pat kynges and princes 
to be war of bostes. Chapter XXX Sum men wenen pat alle wordes and dedes 
þat serueth to pleye 
and to game is veyn | and ydel; 
but it is not so in dede, 
for þat þyng is in f. vayn 
and in idel pat 
is not iordeyned for þewe ende. 
Panne al þat may of itself be yordeyned to pew ende is not in vayn and in ydel. 
And game and pley pat is liberal, 
honeste and modérât 
is iordeyned to good ende, 
for it is nedfol in som wise in pe lif of mankynde. 
Perfore it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
þat rest and pley semen 
nedfol in pe lif. 
Panne as pe bodilich sencible wit, 
as pe w i t of huyryng and of sigte, 
trauaylleth in huryng and in sight, 
perfore kynde ordeyned sleep 
by cause of reste of pe wittes; 
and sleep is nedfol. 
So for in studyng oþer 
in nedes of pe regne oper in oper dedes and nedes 
we trauelleth alwey, 
som delectacioun and likynge of game 
and of pley - gif 
it is moderate and honest - we taketh among, 
and not an idel, 
among oure besinesse and trauaille. 
Werf ore by cause pat 
in suche game 
and pley it happeth to do wel 
and also to mysdo, 
per mote be a vertue among game and pley 
by þe whiche we may haue vssilf 
as we scholde [in] game 
and in pley. 
For in game and in pley 
som men passeth and desireth 
to do al foule dedes and doynges and iapes of þe whiche it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
pat pei fondeþ more to make men lige pan to speke 
and do more semeliche doyng, 
and suche bien mynstralles 
and pe philosofer clepeth hem bomoloccos. 
A[nd] pe philosofer likneth suche iapers to foules 
and to bryddes 
þat taken pray 
þat is ihalwed 
in templis of naciouns. 
For as þulke briddes and foules reccheth not 
in what manere a mowe take 
v sum what of p a t prayge, 
so p e i p a t wolle 
in alle wise make men lige and make mowes reccheþ not in what wise pey mowe take wordes and dedes of o p e r e men and turne | hem to game and to mowes. 
Panne col. pese passen in game and in pleye. 
And somme o p e r e doun agenward and faillen 
and ben icleped dury and agrestes, boynardes, 
and suche soffren no game 
ne pley noþer speken 
m u r e 
but ben wrothe to hem 
p a t speken of murþe. 
Panne it is iknowe 
in what is iocunditas (iocunditas, 
p a t hatte also eutrapelia, 
resonable murþe and game, 
as it is a vertue and as we speken p e r 
o i at p i s tyme), 
for it abateth passyng 
and to moche pley 
and moderateþ scarsetee 
and to luyte pley. 
And p i s vertue stondej in moderatyng scarsete and boynardy in pley 
and abateth passyng 
and to moche pley 
and stondeth not ileche principalliche 
in e i p e r . 
For a vertue stondeþ 
most principallich in pe most difficulté, 
and it is more difficulté 
to abate passyng 
and to moche pley þanne 
it is to moderate defaute and scarsete of pley. 
For pley hath a manere likynge anexed þerto by pe whiche we ben more inclyned 
þerto and hauen more likynge to take delectacioun and likyng of game and of pley, 
þanne we hauen to forsake and leue suche delectacioun and likyng. 
For it is iknowe 
what is eutrapelia 
p a t hatte also iocunditas, resonable murþe and game, 
[and] where inne it stondeþ 
(for it stondiþ principallich in abatyng passyng 
and to moche pley and game 
and by pe consequent folwyng in moderatynge defaute and scarsete of pleye and of game) 
þarnie it is to wetynge 
how it is semelich 
p a t kynges and princes be iocunde and mery. 
And tofore it is declared 
p a t alwey to moche 
and to luyte is blamed 
and pe mené ipreysed; 
and suche mené 
p a t is in vertues, 
in passions, and sterynges 
is not itake 
by pe quantité of a byng 
but in comparisoun to vs for, 
| as it is iseid in pe chapitres f. o tofore, 
som what it is to moche to oon man 
p a t is to litel for anoþer man, 
and agenward. 
Panne gif it is semelich 
for alle men 
to abate passyng 
and to moche pley, 
it is moche more semelich p a t kynges and princes vse games and pleyes so moderatliche; 
but gif p e i dede 
p e i schulde be holde 
but comyne persones oper agristes, boynardes. 
Panne it schal not be vnderstonde 
p a t kynges and princes schulde haue no solace of game and of pley 
but as pe philosofer seith, iiii Ethicorum, game and pley 
p a t we schulde vse schulde be liberal and honest. 
Kynges and princes schulde vse suche pley and game so moderatliche 
p a t p e i seme alwey stedefast and sad and in no wise childliche. 
For fram pe childhod it semeth kyndelich to children to haue likyng and game and pley, 
wherfore gif pe game 
is not honest it semeth 
p a t sum childhod is 
annexedfcerto.Panne pe worse 
p a t it is to kynges and princes to be childlich, 
pe more moderatlich he schulde vse likynge of pley and of game. 
r Also it is declared 
p a t delectacioun of pleye and of game 
is not an ydel noþer in veyn 
for it is iordeyned to good ende; 
for among traueile and besinesse we taken recreacioun and confort of pley and of game 
and therby [be] 
pe more fresch and feruent in good workes 
of pe whiche we hauen þe charge. 
Wherfore by cause 
p a t inmoderat and inhonest pley and game 
wiþdraweth vs fro good workes 
and fro pe pew besynesse, 
garnie pe more besynesse 
and charge of pe comyn profit longen to kynges and princes; 
and pe more excellent þe charge 
of þe comyn profite 
is passyng singuler profit, 
pe worse it is gif kynges and princes vsen inmoderatliche and inhonestliche delectacioun and likyng of pleye and I of game. 
Panne nougt in alle wise schulde meri wordes and dedes col. be forbode gif þei bien honest and moderate, 
and p a t more and lasse as diuersete of persone requireth. Chapter XXXI 
Bothe holy men and philosofres accorden here 
inne þat vertues mote be annexed 
and ibounde togedres and menep p a t he þat hath on vertue han alle vertues and he p 
a t lacked oon lacked alle. 
Panne for it is iknowe 
at þe folle p a t it is semeliche p a t kynges [and] princes hauen sum vertues, 
for it is playnlich declared p a t he mote haue prudencia and iusticia, 
Jeanne it mot be clerlich yknowe p a t p e i mote haue al vertues, 
for prudencia and iusticia 
may not be without o p e r e vertues, 
and so no vertue 
may be parfit wijsoute alle vertues. 
And som wise men p a t treteth of vertues menen 
þat vertues bien connexed 
and ibounde togeders; 
but it semeth p a t pe contrarie is soth. 
For we seep and knoweth p a t sum men ben liberal 
and not temporate 
but geuen hem to dedes of lecherie, 
and som ageward, 
and some bien chast and coueitous. 
Pan not eche man 
p a t hath on vertue hath al vertues, 
noþer it nedeþ not þei some vertues be necessarie 
and nedfol to kynges and princes 
þat al vertues be necessarie and nedfol to hem. 
And so we seep p a t som man is liberal 
and may not be magnificus, 
for he may not make grete workes 
for he hath nougt wherewiþ. 
Perfore it is to wetyng þat, sexto Ethicorum, 
circa fine[m], 
pe philosofer preueth clerliche 
p a t vertues bep connexid. 
But for to asoile suche obieccions he seip p a t we may haue double consideracioun of vertues 
as p e i bien kyndelich vertues and vnparfite, 
oþer as þei bien principal vertuous, complet and parfitg. 
And kyndeliche vertues and vnparfit 
nedeþ 
not to be connexed for we | seeth p a t som men hauen kynde- f. 
o liehe sum sleyþe and sotelte of wit and hauen perfore sum vnparfite prudencia 
and bien not chaste, 
ne liberal noþer, 
noþer hauen o p e r vertues morale. 
Also we seen p a t fro childhode summe bien anoun inclined to dedes of largenesse and ben not chast and somme agenward and hauen a manere kynde[li]ch chastite and bien not liberal. 
v Panne vertues ben not connexed 
and ibounde togefceris, 
but vertues þat bien icleped principale 
oþer parfite in hymsilf oþer in a certeyn ful ny disposicioun 
mot nedes be connexed. 
And we menen in ny disposicioun 
for by cause of lacke of recheise pore men schulde not be icleped magnifici 
as þe philosofer meneth. 
But gif pore men ben very and parfit liberal accordyng to here richeise and catel, 
þanne þei bien ful ney to be magnifici; 
for gif here good wolde tille, 
anon he wolde make grete workes. 
Panne to vnderstonde playnliche þis menyng, 
it is to declaryng hou no vertue may be parfit 
wiþcoute alle oþer vertues. 
Panne it is to wetynge 
þat vs nedeþ vertues 
þat whanne we setten oure entent in good ende 
þat we may by vertues come 
þewliche to þat ende. 
Panne in suche doyng it happeth to faille in tweye manere wise: 
first, gif we setteþ ous in an iuel ende 
as vicious men doun; 
for coueitous men Studien to chese here ende 
and geue hemself to coueitousnesse, 
and intemporate men geuen hem to lecherie, 
and so of oþere. Pe seconde, 
it happeth to faille 
in suche doynge gif we cometh not to þat ende in þew manere, 
for som wole geue moneye and giftes 
and sette here ende 
in workes of largenesse; 
but he reccheth not where 
of he taketh | oþer col. 
of wham he takefc 
so 
þat þei mowe geue giftes to oþere men. 
And som tyme by þefte 
and som tyme by opoun wronges 
suche men 
ouersettefc and spoylen oþer men 
for to do workes of largenesse. 
Panne þey g suche men cheese a good ende, git þei comen not rigtfulliche to þat ende. 
Panne [a] ‡signeth not in þe ende noþer in þe entencioun 
but he signeth in þe wey 
and in þe manere of comynge to þe ende 
þat þei desiren. 
Perfore þei suche men ben 
in sum manere wise liberal, 
git þey schulde not be cleped parfit liberale; 
for a parfite vertue schal not onliche chese a good ende, 
but he schal also come to þat ende 
in rigtful maner wise. 
Panne vs nedeþ vertues moral, 
for þerby we chesen to vs a good ende; 
and vs nedeþ prudencia, 
for þerby we maken rigtfol resons of menés 
þat bryngeth vs to good ende. 
Panne vertues moral most principalich chesen 
a rigtfol ende for, 
as it is iseye, 
suche as þe tonges bien, 
suche ben þe tastes. 
if þe tonge were swithe infecte wiþ colera, 
al mete and drynke schulde seme bettre; 
and gif it were swifce infecte 
with swete fleume, 
al mete and drynke schulde seme 
som del swete. 
So suche as we ben in wille and appetite, 
suche an ende we chesen 
(as he þat is intemporat cheseth and geueth hym to lecherie, 
and he þat is temporate cheseth for his ende chastite, 
and liberal cheseth to spende, 
and auarus to spare spendyng and cost); 
wherfore vertues morale maken appetite parfit 
and chesen a rigtful ende. 
For gif we hauen good appetite 
by þilke vertues, 
we chesen to vs a goode ende; 
and prudencia principalich ordeyne[þ] rigtful menés 
to come to þe ende. 
For whan we chesen vs a good ende 
by vertues moral, 
by prudencia we ben resonabliche avised 
of þe menés 
p a t bryngen to p a t ende. 
| f. Perfore, vi Ethicorum, 
it is iseid 
þat vertues moral chesen a good ende and prudencia makeþ ritfol doyng 
by pe whiche we comen to ‡ p a t ende. 
Panne for to speke principalliche and first, 
a vertue moral cheseth a ritful ende 
and prudencia ordeyneth a ritful wey to p a t ende; 
and for pe wey is not parfit 
but it be ordeyned to good ende, 
prudencia is neuer parfit 
withoute vertues morale 
by pe whiche we chesen to vs a good ende. 
Also for neuere good ende [i]s ihad treuliche and parfitliche 
but we come þerto 
by a good weye, 
we hauen neuer a vertue morale parfitliche withoute prudencia. Panne, vi Ethicorum, circa finem, 
pe philosofer wol make suche a resoun: 
he þat hath parfitliche eny vertue moral 
hath parfit prudencia, 
and he p a t hath parfit prudencia 
hath ech vertue. 
Pan he p a t hath eny vertue 
hath eche vertue; 
p a n vertues moral and prudencia 
ben so connexed 
þat no man is good 
bi vertues morale 
but he be prudens, 
þat is redy. 
Pan for a vertue moral is good habite 
and cheseþ 
and makeþ hym parfite 
p a t hath hym 
and makeþ his worke goode, 
for to chese wel and to doo good work, 
it suffiseth not to chese a good ende 
but me come to p a t ende 
by a good wey. 
Pe vertue moral 
by pe whiche we chesen to vs a good ende 
may not be withoute prudencia 
by pe whiche we may come rifulliche to p a t ende. 
Also prudencia may not be withoute vertue moral. 
And prudencia and industria ben diuers 
and pe philosofer menep 
p a t industra hatte dyinotica, 
and he is clepid deinos and industris 
þat can for eche ende 
p a t is ichose to fynde weyes 
for to come sone to p a t ende. 
Perfore he p a t is intemporate and vicious 
may be industris and deinos, 
so p a t he can bythenke hym of weyes 
by pe whiche he may come 
to dedes of lecherie 
and to do foule doyng 
p a t he cheseth for likynge ende. 
But no I man is yclepid prudens 
but he kunne fynde good weyes to col. 
come to a good end. 
Panne he p a t findyth goode weys 
to come to a good ende 
is not prudens 
withoute vertuis moral 
by pe whiche we chesen to vs a good ende. 
But sum man wol mené p 
a t a vertue morale 
may not be wiþoute prudencia so p 
a t eche good man is prudens, 
and aenward; 
natheles it nedeth not p 
a t he p 
a t hath oon vertue parfitliche haue alle vertues moral parfitliche, 
for a man may haue parfit temporancia and prudencia 
as it serueth to temporancia 
and not haue o p e r e vertues noþer prudencia 
as it serueth to o p e r e vertues. 
Pan þÍS man may be parfitliche temporate, 
and not fortys but ferful, 
noþer large of iftes but a chynche. 
But p i s may not stonde, 
for no man may be parfitlich temporate 
but he be fortis and large and but he haue oþere vertues. 
Also no man may haue sum vertue 
but he haue al vertues. 
For he is parfitliche temporate 
p a t d o p 
in no wise dedes of lecherie 
aenst r resoun. 
Wherfore, 
gif he is ferfol, 
þei hym like not dedes of lecherie for hemsilf, 
gut to flee and voide betyng and maymyng oþer dep, 
he wolde assente to do dedes of lecherie. 
Also, thei he be auarus and sette his ende 
and his entent to haue money, 
on caas p e i workes of lecherie 
plese hym not of hemself, 
git gif a myte winne moneye 
þat he loueth as his good ende, 
he rougt not for to do lecherie. 
Panne vnparfitliche on vertue 
may be wiþoute 
o p e r e vertues, 
but compleet and parfitliche 
it may not be in none wise. 
Wherfore gif it is semeliche 
þat kynges and princes be 
as it were half goddes 
and haue parfit vertues, 
it is semelich to hem to haue al vertues, 
for on vertue may not be parfit 
withoute oþere vertues. 
| it it is spedful f. 
to kynges and princes, 
for p e i mowe not excuse hemsilf by defaute 
o[per] lakke of outward good, 
to haue al vertues not onliche in nygh disposicioun 
but also in parfitnesse and dede. 
Som man may be pore and parfit - <magnificus> - 
<and for lacke and defaute>, 
alþei he make not grete workes, 
for he hath not wherof noþer wherwith to do gret coste and spendyng. 
But a kyng may neuere be parfit 
but he do grete workes 
and be parfit in alle vertues. 
v Chapter XXXII 
yf we taken besiliche hede 
of þe philosofres wordes, 
vii Ethicorum, 
we may distingwe foure grees of euel 
and foure grees of good. 
For euele men ben in foure manere gree, 
for som ben molles 
and som incontinent 
and som intemporate 
and som bien bestial. 
Also good men ben in foure maner degre, 
for some ben perseueraunt 
and somme continent 
and som temporate and somme diuini, 
swithe good. 
And Ipei bien icleped molles 
Ipat fallen for a litel passioun oþer 
for a litel temptacioun 
as pe name molle tokneþ; 
for in libro De Generacione þe philosofer seith þat molle, nesche, is sone ouercome. 
Perfore as þe philosofer meneth pey bien molles, nesche, 
p a t wol not traueylle, 
but pey ben to delicate; 
for as it is iseid, 
vii Ethicorum, delicial likynge 
is a certeyn mollicies, neschenesse; 
and suche men wolle suffre no difficulté 
but fallen anon 
as p e i ben tempted. 
In pe oþere gree ben incontinent men and Ipes ben distingued fro pe firste, 
for he p a t is mollis 
may soffre no temptacioun ne difficulté. 
And he p a t is incontinent suffreth temptacioun 
and p a t insufficientliche and fayleth; and continere, 
as pe word tokeneth, 
is to mené to holde hymself agenst anoten | 
But incontinere is auentryng in temptacioun oþer col. 
in figtyng and haue nougt mygt to hold itsilf 
but to faille. 
In pe þridde degree ben intemporat men, 
for he is intemporat 
þat not onliche fallen 
by temptacioun 
but also it is likynge to hym to mysdo. 
But he þat is incontinent 
and he p a t is mollis hauen not likynge 
in euel doynge 
and cheseth on and d o p anojser. 
'For whan thei ben not itempted 
‡bope he þat is incontinent 
and he p a t is mollis 
cheseth to do wel and cheseth also goode lawes and fallen 
whan þei ben tempted and holden none of thilke lawes. 
And pe philosofer likneth suche men to men 
p a t wolde goo rigtsomes; 
and for pe body is dissolued 
and senewes and iunttes islaked, 
pey mowe not rewle pe body 
and g o p perfore leftsomes 
whan he wold goo rigtsome. 
So he p a t is mollis 
and he p a t is incontinent casten to do wel 
and to goo rigtsome; 
but for pe potencial vertues of pe saule ben dissolute and islaked 
and not ireuled by pe ordre of resoun, 
perfore p e i gon not rigtsome 
but fallen and gon liftsome. 
But he p a t is mollis fallen 
o p e r wise p 
a n he p a t is incontinent, 
for he p a t is mollus falliþ 
with a litil temptacioun 
and he p a t is incontinent 
fällig with grettere temptacioun; 
but he p a t is intemporat is worse þan he p a t is incontinent 
o p e r mollis 
for he is so ivsed to yuel p a t it is likynge to hym to do yeuel. 
In pe ferpe degre beþe p e i p a t ben bestial; 
and bep worse p 
a n p e i p 
a t bep intemporate, 
for p e i p 
a t bep bestial done 
euil passing pe maner of mankinde. 
For pe bestial man 
d o p doingge p 
a t is orrible to kinde; 
for some in strange contreys 
eten manis flesch 
and drynken manis blood, 
and suche doynge may not come 
but of bestial tee. 
And, vii Ethicorum, 
pe philosofer rekeneth many suche bestialtees and seith p a t per was a | womman with child 
and mygt nougt be deliuered of f. childe 
at here owne wille and took so greet sorowe perfore 
p a t sehe fil 
in so greet bestialte 
p a t sehe wolde slitte alle wymmen 
þat were w i p childe; 
and so for he mygte not be deliuered of childe, 
schu wolde p a t no womman 
scholde þerafter be deliuered of childe. 
Also, 
as he seith, 
aboute a certeyn ile of pe see, 
as it were Pontus, 
were p a t tyme certeyn men so bestial p a t 
p e i ete rawflescheand deuoured mannis flesch; 
and gut worse, 
for p e i lynede here owne children 
to make festes 
w i p ham. 
And so gif a man wolde make anoþer a feste, 
gif his awne sone were not at home, 
he wolde borwe his neigbores sone 
and araye hym 
to be igete in pe feste; 
and byhoteth whanne his neigbore wol make a feste, 
he wolde geue his owne sone 
to be arayed and igete in pe feste. 
Also, 
as he seith, 
aboute pe contrée 
at Phalarun dwelled bestial men 
p a t sacrefied here owne modrys 
and ete lyuours of men. 
Panne bestial men 
d o p euel passyng pe manere of mankynde. 
For it is ispoke of foure manere of euel men, 
it is to spekyng of foure maner of good men; 
for as some euil men ben molles, nesche, 
and fallen for a litel temptacioun, 
so som good men ben perseuerent and stondeþ 
and fallen not for a litel temptacion. 
And p a n for to speke of perseuerancia 
as pe philosofer spekeþ þerof, 
perseuerancia is not ellis 
but a certeyn good disposicioun contrarie to mollicies, neschenesse. 
Panne in pe firste degree it ben pay p 
a t ben perseuerant. 
And in pe seconde degree it bien pay p 
a t ben contynent, 
for it is more to be continent 
p a n t o be perseuerant. 
For he p a t is not tempted, 
r o oþer litel itempted and falleþ not, 
is perseuerant; 
but he is not continent 
but he be strongliche ytempted 
and ouercome þe temptacioun, 
for no man is continent 
but he holde hymself stedefast agenst tempta|cioun. 
Perfore, vii Ethicorum, 
it is iseide 
þat continencia 
is bettre þan col. perseuerancia. 
In þe þridde gree of good men 
ben þey þat ben temporat. 
For ‡ oon is icleped temporat 
þat not oonliche is perseuerant in litel temptacioun, 
as þei þat ben perseuerant doun, 
oþer stonden stedefast agenst strong temptacioun, 
[as þei þat ben continent 
doun,] 
but þei þat ben so ichasted 
in þe appetite and hauen so modérât temptacioun 
as þei a felid no strif of temptacioun, 
but it is likyng to hem to do wel; 
þanne as perseuerancia is contrarie to mollicies, 
and continencia to incontinencia, 
so temporancia is contrarie to intemporancia. 
For as it is likyng to hem 
þat ben intemporate to do euel, 
so it is likyng to hem 
þat ben temporate to do wel. 
And in þe ferfce and cheef degree of gode men ben þei 
þat ben icleped diuini. 
For as som men ben bestial 
and 
eue[l]e passynge þe manere of mankynde, 
so som bien as it were diuini 
and ben goode passyng 
þe manere of mankynde. 
Perfore, vii Ethicorum, circa principium, 
þe philosofre seith þat Homerus speketh of Ector 
and seith þat his fader 
Priamus seide of hym 
þat he was ful good 
and fcerfore a semede not þe childe of a man 
þat scholde deyge 
but þe child of god. 
And þe vertue by þe whiche a man is good passynge 
þe manere of mankynde 
is cleped of þe philosofer eroyca, 
þat is principal lady vertu. 
Panne hereby it is iknowe 
þat gif kynges and princes 
schal be rigtfulliche lordes, 
it is not inowe 
to hem 
to forsake al grees of euel men 
as þat þei be not molles, 
nesche, noþer incontinent 
noþer intemporat noþer bestiale 
but hem nedeþ be in þe cheef degree of good men. 
For who þat desiren to be lord and prince 
of oþere men 
nedeth to haue þat vertue 
þat is prince and lady of oþer vertues. 
And þei þat hauen þis vertue ben good | passynge þe manere of oþere men 
and ben as it were f. godische men. 
Panne it is semeliche 
þat kynges and princes be in þis gree. 
And gif seculer princes schulde be in þis degree 
and so good and parfite, 
princes of Holi Chirche scholde be þat schal be do 
vpon þe dom of men 
þat ben prudent, wise and redy. 
v Chapter XXXIII 
Bothe Macrobius and Plotinus 
distingwen foure degrees of vertues, 
for som ben politice 
and som purgatory 
and somme purgati animi and some exemplares. 
[And som saye vertues ben exemplares] in God. 
And politik vertues ben vertues igete by good vsages 
and fcewes by þe whiche vertues men beren hem wel 
in nedes of mankynde; 
but þe vertues purgatorie, 
þat ben vertues of þe saule 
þat is purget, 
‡ cometh of certeyn giftes of God 
by þe whiche vertues man bereth hym wel 
in worschip and seruice of God. 
In worschep and seruice of God 
is double gree, 
for somme comen toward pe liknesse of God 
and suche hauen vertues purgatorie; 
and som hauen in som maner wise p i s liknesse of God, 
and suche hauen þe vertues 
þat ben icleped virtutes purgati animi, 
of a purged soule. 
Pei pese speken † w o r d e s †in hemsilf, 
it semeth not p a t p 
e i comen to þe moenyng of hem 
þat speken of vertues inÞISwise. 
For philosofres speken 
not but of vertuesþatben igete by goode vsages 
and pewe and setten not vertues 
p a t comen of suche a special gift of God; 
þoanne alle vertues 
p a t pey setten comen 
as he seyde of good vsage 
and doyng of mankynde. 
Panne folwynge pe weye of pe philosofres, 
we may saye p a t 
as pe[r] ben diuerse grees of gode men, 
so per ben diuerse manere vertues, 
so p a t a man is more excellentliche good 
so he hath more excellent gree of vertue. 
For as pe philosofer setteþ foure grees | of good men, 
as it is col. iseid in pe chapitre tofore 
(for he seith p a t 
som ben perseuerant and somme continent 
and som temporate and som diuinis, 
passynge pe manere of goodnesse and of mankynde), 
so we may distyngwe foure ordres of virtues, 
so þat we geuen to eche degree of good men 
his owne ordres of vertues. 
Panne we schal seie p a t þei p a t ben perseuerant 
hauen vertues politik, 
and p e i p a t ben continent 
hauen vertues purgatorie, 
and p e i p a t ben temporat 
hauen pe vertues purgati animi, 
of a purged soule, 
but p e i p a t ben diuini hauen pe vertue p 
a t passen aboue dedes and thinges. 
Wherfore as diuini ben bettre p a n temporate, 
and temporate beter þan continent, 
and continent bettre p a n perseuerant, so þe vertues exemplaris passen pe vertues purgati animi, 
and þe vertues purgati animi passen pe vertues purgatorie, 
and pe vertues purgatorie passen pe vertues politik. 
And p a t pese manere vertues schulde be iordeyned 
to pe forseid degrees of good men 
it is ipreued by Plotenus 
p a t seith 
þat þe firste, vertues politik, 
neicheþ and b r y n g e þ to m e n é . 
Pe seconde, purgatorie, 
d o p awey vnhoneste. 
Pe þridde, 
þe vertues purgati animi, 
forgeteth vnhoneste. 
Pe ferbe, exemplaris, 
by cause of thilke vertues 
it is not laweful to nempne eny foule thing. 
Wherfore it is wel iseid 
þat p e i p 
a t ben perseuerant hauen vertues politik; 
for, 
as it is iseide, 
perseuerancia is contrarie tomollicies, neschenesse, 
and it suffiseth for a man 
to be perseuerant p 
a t he holde hym in pe mené. 
Panne pe vertues p 
a t is pollitik disposen pe inwit to do wel 
and bryngeth pe inwit to mené, 
and suche vertues longen to hem 
þat ben perseuerant. 
Panne suche vertues ben lest among o p e r e vertues; 
and for to speke of perseuerancia, 
as pe philosofer speke}} | perof, p e i f. 
p a t ben perseuerantes 
ben in pe lowest degree of gode men. 
Pan suche vertues longen to hem 
þat ben perseuerant. 
r But pe vertues purgatorie longon to hem 
p a t ben continent. 
For þerby a man is continent 
gif he holdeþ hymself 
fro sencible delectaciouns and likyng, 
for continent men withstonden temptacion and figt[en] þere agen, 
and þe name þerof, 
ouercomynge suche tempta cioun. 
And þair likynge is to wiþdrawe þerfrom and forsake hem. 
Perfore it is iseid 
p a t pe vertues purgatorie longen to hem þat ben continent 
and pe offis of suche vertues 
is to wiþdrawe vs fram inmoderate passions and likyng. 
And pe vertues p a t ben icleped virtutes purgati animi longen to hem 
p a t ben temporate, 
for suche vertues wiþdrawen vs not but maken vs 
as þowg it were 
to forgete suche delectacioun and likynge; 
for he þat is temporat hap appetite so ipurged 
þat it is with hym 
as he felede no strif 
but forgeteth inmoderat passiouns and doun wel w i p 
som manere tdifficultef. 
Panne it is wel iseid 
þat suche oon hap pe vertues p a t ben icleped virtutes purgati animi and maken hym 
forgete inmoderate passions, 
for his þought and his inwit is purged and ichasted so þathe reccheth not of suche passions. 
Pe ferpe manere vertues, 
p a t ben icleped exemplares, 
may longe to men 
p a t ben icleped diuini, godlich men, 
for suche men scholde ben so parfit 
p a t h e schold be reule 
and ensample of oþere men. 
Panne pe firste 
p a t was purposed 
in þe bygynnyng of pe chapitre is declared: 
for it is declared 
p e r ben diuers grees of vertues, 
and it is no difficulté to declare pe secunde 
and to schewe what vertues kynges and princes scholde haue gif pe wordes 
p a t ben iseid ben wel vnderstonde. 
For it is seid tofore 
p a t it is not inow for kynges and princes to be perseuerant, | continent, and temporate but p 
e i schulde be in som wise col. diuinos, goddysch. 
Panne pe vertues 
p a t longeþ to hem may be cleped exemplares for p 
e i schulde be reule 
and ensample of oþere. 
For kynges and princes schulde be good so þat eueriche of here 
sugettes migte take ensample of lyuynge 
and knowe his owne defaute seyenge pe parfitnesse 
and pe lyuynge of pe prince. 
Wherfore kynges and princes schulde hate nougt oonliche 
to do vile dedes 
but also to speke 
and to huyre foule wordes and spekyng. 
Panne it longefc wel to hem 
to haue vertues exemplares, 
by pe whiche, 
as Plotinus seith, 
it is forbode to speke foule wordes and tales. 
But for no man may be so good 
withoute special grace and help of God, 
pe more kynges and princes scholde be excellent passyng oþere men, 
pe more besilich and hertliche he scholde prayge and beseche grace 
and helpe of God. 
Panne [he]rin pe pruyde of philosofres is atent 
p a t wolde mené p a t w e may by pure kyndeliche doynge forsake al euel, 
and come to parfite goodnesse. Ill Chapter XXXIV 
It is iseid tofore hond þat, 
þei for to speke largeliche of vertues 
eche disposicioun of þe soule 
may be icleped a vertu, 
nathales sum good disposicioun 
is more anexed 
and helpyng to vertues 
and disposyng 
fcerto þanne 
it is a vertue. 
Al[s]o som good disposicioun is not verreiliehe a vertue 
but it is som what aboue a vertue. 
But how þat scholde be it 
is not git ipreued for þei 
ben not gut declared 
by þe whiche al fcis schal be iknowe. 
But giffcisþatis iseide is iknowe, 
it is no difficulté to schewe 
in som wise 
how þe thinges stonden. 
For eubulia and synosis ‡ ben vertues of consaillyng and of demyng, 
for to speke largeliche of vertues. 
Perfore, | f. vi Ethicorum, 
þe philosofre clepeth hem virtu tes. 
But for to speke of vertues 
as we speken here of vertues, 
eubulia and sinosis failen in som wise of þe reson of vertue. 
For as it is iseid, ii Ethicorum, 
þat it longeth to a vertue 
first to haue connynge 
and þanne chesynge 
and þe þridde to worche stedfastlich withoute chaunge, 
wherfore for eubulia 
consailefc and synosis demeth 
and prudencia commaundeþ 
to do werkes stedefastlich 
after þe consaile and dome, 
prudencia is ner to þe work 
and is rafcer and hafc more reson of vertue 
þan eubulia and synosis 
þat consailleth and demeth. 
Panne fcilke twey vertues 
ben more resonabliche icleped helpynge and seruynge to vertues 
þan be icleped vertues. 
Panne it is wel iseid þat som good disposicions 
helpeth and ben anexed to vertues; 
but som desposen to vertues 
as perseuerancia and continencia. 
For continencia is not proprelich a vertue, 
for to þe vertues man 
it is likynge to do wel; 
for fceig he þat is continent 
folweth not passions but resoun, 
get for he is not continent 
bot for he withstondefc passions 
by cause of þe strif 
þat he feleþ, 
it is not likyng to hym to do welle. 
Panne while a man is continent 
and hath stronge passions, 
he hath not parfit vse of resoun and of vertue. 
Natheless ouercomynge þulke passiouns he is disposed to be vertuous. 
Wherfore þei continencia 
may be cleped a vertue 
for to speke largeliche of vertues, 
git it semeth more 
þat it is a disposicioun to vertue 
þanne it semeth a vertue. 
But for continencia is betere þan perseuerancia 
(for to speke of perseuerancia 
as þe philosofer speketh þerof, 
perseuerancia failleth of þe resoun of þe vertue 
and isfcerforenot a vertue 
but a disposicioun to vertue 
oþer som condicioun of a vertue. 
[To] declare in what wise perseuerancia 
is a disposicioun to a vertue 
and in what whise it is a condicioun | of a vertue it longeth not to þis tretis. 
But it is inow at þis col. 
tyme to wite and to knowe 
þat for to speke of perseuerancia, 
as we speketh tofore 
and as þe philosofer spekefc þerof, 
perseuerancia is a certeyn disposicioun to a vertue. 
And ‡ þe ertue eroyca, 
þat we may clepe a godlich vertue, 
is more verreylich aboue vertue 
þanne it is a v vertue. 
Perfore, vii Ethicorum, 
þe philosofer speketh of þis vertue 
and seith þat it is not a vertue 
but it is more worschepful þan a vertue. 
Panne for prudencia and iusticia and oþere of þe whiche we hauen itreted tofore [ben vertues], 
þe vertues of consaille and of doom 
ben anexed to vertues 
and to prudencia, 
and continencia and perseuerancia ben disposicions to vertues, 
and eroyca is aboue vertues, 
it is wel iseid 
þat some goode disposicions 
ben vertues 
and somme ben anexed to vertues 
and somme disposed to vertues 
and somme ben aboue vertues. 
Panne þat kynges and princes 
may haue goode disposicions 
of wit and of soule, 
it is semelich 
þat he knowe þese maneres good disposicions. Part III 
How manye ben pe passions of pe soule and how pe nombre þerof schal be take. 
Whiche of pe forsaide passions ben raper 
and whiche hauen ordre togedres. 
and whiche ben latter 
How kynges and princes schulde haue hemself 
in wrathe and in loue. 
How and in what thinges kynges and princes schulde desire and hate. 
How kynges and princes schulde haue hem 
in trist and hope, 
in wanhope and dispeir. 
How kynges and princes schulde haue hemself 
in hardinesse and drede. 
How ira and odium ben diuerse 
and how kynges and princes schulde haue hemsilf 
in ira, wrethe, and in pe contrarie þerof. 
How kynges and princes scholde haue | hemself 
in likynge and in f. sorowe. 
r How somme of thes passions 
ben more principale and somme lasse principale. 
How þe passions of the soule ben reducte to þer passions. 
Whiche of pe forseide passions 
ben to preysynge 
and whiche ben to blamyng 
and how kynges and princes schulde haue hemself 
in þulke passions. Chapter I 
Twey partees of pis werk ben isped, 
for it is ischewed 
wherinne kynges and princes scholde sette here ende 
and in what wise hem neden to be vertuous. 
Now it is to tretyng of pe þridde partie of pis firste book 
declaryng what passions 
and what meuynges 
of pe soule kynges 
and princes scholde folwy. 
But þis may not be iknowe 
but we knowe first 
how manye suche passions per ben, 
and whiche þerof ben more principale pan 
o p e r e , 
and whiche ben to preysyng 
and whiche ben to blamynge. 
Perfore of pes passions 
we schul firste trete 
and take pe nombre of hem. 
As we seide þat þer ben twelf vertues, 
so we may saye p a t per ben twelf passions 
as amor (loue), odium (hate), desire, abhominacioun, delectacioun, sorwe, hope, desperacio, drede, hardinesse, wrethe, mansuetudo. 
And tofore mansuetudo 
was acounted among vertues 
but p a t was for scarsete of names 
as pe philosofer seith, iiii Ethicorum, 
for it semeth p a t mansuetudo is properliche 
pe name of pe passioun 
þat is contrarie to wrethe. 
But for þer is a certeyn vertue 
bytwene wrethe and inirascibilite, 
and for we haue no propre name 
for p a t vertue, 
we clepen it mansuetudo 
by pe name of pe passion; 
for þat vertue accordeþ more 
w i p p a t passioun þat] hatte mansuetudo <‡> [pan w i p wrethe. 
Mansuetudo] is a name equiuocum, 
pe name of twey | thinges, 
col. for it is pe name of pe vertue 
and of þe passioun p 
a t is contrarie to wrethe. 
And who þat wolde traueille mygt fynde for eche a propre name; 
but while pe menynge is iknowe, 
of pe wordes it is litel charge. 
For pe passions ben rekened, 
pe nombre of hem may be take in ÞIS wise, 
for pe passions ben proprelich 
in pe appétit sencitif. 
And in pe intellectyf ben no suche passions, 
for þe appétit intellectif 
is not bodelich vertue noþer ipigt in bodilich lerne. 
Pan as we speken here of passions, 
eche passion is in pe appetite sencitif. 
And as it is iseid clerliche tofore, 
pe appetite sencitif 
is deuided and hap ii parties, 
p a t on hat irascibilis 
and pe oper concupiscibilis. 
Pan pe forsaid passions 
as pei ben destingwed, 
pe firste sexe, 
as amor (loue), odium (hate), desiderium, abhominacio, delectado, and tristicia, 
longeth to pe concupiscible 
and oper sexe to pe irascible. 
And pe nombre of pe passions 
concupiscible 
may be take in pis wise, 
for eche passion and meuyng of þe soule 
p a t longeth to pe concupiscible is itake 
in comparisoun to good oper euel. 
In comparisoun to good in þre manere wise, 
for in comparisoun to good 
by pe concupiscible 
we hauen thre manere of passions: 
for whan we knowen first 
þat is good, 
it pleseth vs; 
and þanne we fonden to come þerto; 
pe þridde, 
whanne we hauen it iwonne, 
þanne we holden vs apayed þerwiþ. 
Panne whanne thing 
p a t is good pleseth vs, 
we hauen loue; 
and [whanne] we fonden to come þerto, 
we hauen desire; 
and whanne we holden vs I apaied þerwith, 
we holden vs apayed 
and hauen ioye and likyng. 
Panne þes þre passions, amor, desiderium, and delectacio, 
ben itake in comparisoun to good; 
and þes oþer fcre passions, 
odium (hate), abhominacio (abhominacioun), 
and tristicia (sorwe), 
ben itake in comparisoun to euel. 
For whan euel disp[le]sen vs, 
| þanne we hauen f. odium (hate); 
and whanne we fonden and forsaken it, 
þanne we hauen abhominacioun; 
and whanne we hauen euel oþer harme, 
þanne we hauen tristicia (sorwe). 
For it is iknowe how þe passions of þe concupiscible ben itake, 
it is to wetyng how þe passioun of þe irascible ben itake. 
For þes passions ben diuers: 
for þe passions of þe concupiscible hauen comparisoun to good 
oþer to euel 
for it is good oþer euel, 
but þe passions of þe irascible hauen comparisoun to good 
oþer euel 
for it is greet and wiþ difficulté. 
Panne suche passions 
ben itake 
in comparisoun to good oþer euel. 
if þei ben itake in comparisoun to good, 
þat is in twey manere wise: 
oþer for we fondeth to come þerto, 
and so isspes (hope), 
for hope is not elles 
but fonde for to come 
to sum greet good wifc difficulté; 
þanne in comparisoun to good, 
for it is good, 
þer may be loue oþer desire and delectacioun. 
But hope is not in comparisoun to good 
but it be greet and wiþ difficulté; 
wherfore gif we stondefc to come 
to greet good with difficulté, 
þanne is hope. 
But gif we faillen of suche good, 
þanne is desperacio (wanhope). 
Pan hope and despeire ben itake in comparisoun to good, 
and oþer passions of irascible ben itake in comparisoun to euel. 
For we may take hede of euel 
in twey maner wise: 
for it is to comynge oþer it is present. if we take hedefcertofor 
it is to comynge, 
þat it is in twey maner wise: 
oþer we aventreth þer vppoun, 
an[d] so is hardinesse, 
[o]þer we voyden and fleen it, 
and so is drede. 
And gif þe euel is present 
þat is in twey maner wise: 
oþer we arisen to take wreche of þat euel and harme, 
and so is ira, wrethe, 
oþer we leuen to take wreche, 
and so is mansuetudo. 
Panne for þe passioun 
may not be dyuers 
in [m]o manere wise, 
oure meuynges and | strengfces and affeccions 
may not in mo maneres varie, col. Panne in alle ben twelf passions, sexe in concupiscible and sex 
in þe irascible; 
of þe whiche al we hauen itreted diffuseliche 
in rethorik it suffiseth heere to passe ligtliche. 
v Chapter II 
For no man may rule himself wel 
but he knowe whaat passions 
he scholde voide 
and what passions he scholde folwy, 
and in fces firste book 
we fcenketh to termine 
of manis owne reulyng, 
it is to wetynge how many passions 
þer ben 
and what ordre þei hauen eche to oþer 
and whiche ben more principal 
and whiche ben lasse principal 
and how oon passioun is reducte to anofcer. 
For by al fcis þe kynde of þe The Governance of K i n g s a n d P r i n c 
e s passiouns is pe betre iknowe; 
and if pat kynde is iknowe, 
we knowen what passions ben goode 
and what passions ben euel 
and whiche ben to folwyng 
and whiche ben to voydynge. 
Panne for it is iknowe 
how many passions per ben 
and how pe nombre þerof is itake, 
it is to wetyng 
what ordre pey hauen eche to oþere. 
And pe ordre of hem may be itake in twey maner wise: 
by oon and oon or by twyne and tweyne. 
For to take pis ordre 
by tweyne and tweyne 
we may saye þat amor (loue) and odium (hate) 
ben pe firste passions. 
In pe seconde degree ben desiderium and abhominacio; 
in pe þridde degree ben hope and despeire; 
and in pe ferpe degree, drede and hardinesse; 
and in pe fifte degree ben wreth and mansuetudo; 
and delectacio and sorwe 
ben pe laste passiouns. 
For delectacioun and sorwe folweth to al opere passions, 
for in al manere passioun 
a man hath delectacioun oper sorwe. 
Perfore pis twey passiouns ben isette after al oþere passiouns. 
And amor and odium 
ben pe | firste of alle. 
For as delectacioun and f. sorwe 
folweth to al oþere passions, 
for of al opere passions 
cometh delectacioun oper sorwe, 
so of loue oper of hate 
comen þer passions 
for al oþere passions 
springen and comen of loue oper of hate. 
For eche man pat is imeued oper istered 
by eny passiouns 
is so imeued oþer istered 
for he loueth oper 
for he hateth. 
And after loue and hate next ben desire and habominacioun, 
for desire folweth nex to loue. 
For whan [w]e loueth eny thing, 
oþer we desiren to haue it, 
oper gif we hauen it, 
we desiren to saue it in hauynge. 
And abhominacioun folweth next to hate for anon 
as we haten a þyng, 
we hauen abhominacioun perof. 
Wherfore as loue and hate ben pe firste passiouns, 
so desiderium and abhominacio ben pe seconde. 
And in pe þridde place 
ben hope and despeire, 
for whan hope and despeire 
ben itake in comparisoun to good, 
þanne he gop tofore drede and hardinesse 
and tofore 
wrethe and mansuetudo 
pat bien itake 
in comparisoun to yuel. 
And drede and hardinesse gon tofore wrethe and mansuetudo 
pat ben itake in comparisoun to euel and harme þat is present. 
Pan it is pleyneliche iknowe pat pe forsayde passyons hauen ordre gif pei ben itake tweye and tweye. 
And gif pei ben itake oon and oon, 
he schal be iordeyned in pis wise: 
loue is tofore hate, 
desiderium tofore abhominacioun, 
hope tofore despeire, 
drede tofore hardynesse, 
wrethe tofore mansuetudo, 
delectacioun tofore sorwe. 
And loue is tofore hate, 
for alwey pe passioun 
þat is itake in com parisoun to good, 
for it is suche, 
pat is tofore pe passioun 
pat is itake in comparisoun to euele. 
For pe appetite first and principalliche fondeþ to haue good. 
And gif it forsaketh euel, 
| þat is by pe consequent col. 
folwynge for forsakynge of euel 
hat[h] resoun of good. 
Panne loue is pe firste sterynge 
and þe firste passyon 
for hate cometh of loue; 
for but we r I louede som þyng, 
we scholde no thyng hate noþer haue abhominacioun of no thing. 
For by cause pat we louen good and ritwisnesse, 
we haten theues and mysdoers 
and hauen abhominacioun of hem. 
And desiderium pat lenyeth to loue 
is tofore abhominacioun þat lenyeth to hate, 
and hope is tofore dispeire. 
For gif pe firste thing 
pat is wilned is good 
and al pat is iwilned 
is iwilned for cause of goode, 
þanne pe passioun 
þat most iuneth vs to good 
by cause of good 
is tofore opere passiouns. 
And for to wilne good is iunynge to good, 
and betere it is to be iuned to good 
þanne faille perof, 
þanne hope by pe whiche we wilneth and fondeþ to haue good 
is tofore despeire 
by pe whiche we faillen of good. 
And drede is tofore hardinesse 
for as by cause þat pe appetite wilneth principalliche and fondeþ to haue good, 
perfore pe passioun pat fondeth to haue good 
is tofore pe passioun pat failleth of good. 
So for forsakynge of euel is good, 
perfore drede by pe whiche we forsaketh euel 
is tofore audacia 
by pe whiche we auntreth and reseth on euel. 
And among passions 
w r e p is tofore mansuetudo, 
for mansuetudo is not proprelich a passioun 
but it is more verreyliche faillyng of passioun; 
perfore among passions 
wrethe is byfore mansuetudo. 
And whether in sum opere manere wise mansuetudo 
be byfore wrethe it longeth not to pis doynge to trete. 
And delectacioun pat is in comparisoun to good 
is tofore sorwe pat is in comparisoun to euel. 
Panne it is iseie how many passions 
per ben and iknowe | 
by pis pat f. is iseid 
how pei ben iordeyned togeders. 
And in som wise 
and by pe liknesse 
þe kynde of passions 
is iknowe to vs 
and þerby we may knowe 
in som wise 
how pe forseide passions 
scholde ben folwede oþer forsake. 
And þe more euel and harme may come 
of passions of kynges and of princes 
and þe more excellent [good] may be put of by here passions, 
pe more nede it is pat kynges and princes knowe þe distinccioun and kynde of pes passiouns. 
But þis schal be treted more diffuselich heere after. Chapter III 
For passions maketh diuersete in reulyng 
and in oure leuyng, 
it is nedfol to declare how we schul haue vsself in passions. 
Panne it was nedfol to rekene al pe passions 
pat we mygt knowe pe nombre of passions 
of 
pe whiche we schal determyne, 
and it was nedfol to declare pe ordre þerof 
þat we mygt knowe 
in what ordre we schulde determine þerof. 
Wherfore by cause 
þat loue and hate ben pe firste passiouns, 
firste it is to wetynge 
how it is semelich pat kynges and princes loue and hate v and in what wise. 
And p a t we declare pe name of loue, amor, 
and not onliche for it is propreliche a passioun 
but also as it is ifounde 
in þe appetit sencitif oþer intellectif, 
we may saye p a t alway þe obiecte of loue is good. 
(And here it is to wetyng p 
a t pe obiecte of sigt is þyng p a t is iseie as colour o[r] ligt, 
and pe obecte of heryng is þyng 
þat is herd as voys and soun; 
and so pe obiecte of loue is þyng 
p a t is iloued as good þyng.) 
Panne pe more good a þyng is, 
pe more principaliche and pe more strongliche it is loued. 
And in good p a t longeth to God 
and to pe comynte is more good nesse þanne singuler good. 
Panne eche man schal loue good 
in p a t wise so 
p a t he first 
and principalliche louye pe good | 
p a t longeth to col. God and þe comyn good. 
For in pe goodnesse of God 
is pe goodnesse of eche man more 
p a n in hymself. 
For pe goodnesse of God kepeth and saueth our goodnesse. 
And [i]f oure goodnesse, 
p a t i[s o]f God, 
were anulled or destroied, 
wherwith scholde man 
o p 
e r mygte o p 
e r wolde fede o p 
e r help hymself? 
Wherfore bi cause p 
a t no man 
wiþoute pe helpe of God 
may make hymsilf good noþer 
saue hymself in goodnesse, 
kynde resoun wol p 
a t he schal loue God more 
p a n hymself, 
for pe goodnesse of ech man cometh principallich of God 
and is more excellentliche ikept and isaued in God 
p a n in hymself. 
And for comyn good is more 
[goodelich]e p a n singuler good 
as it is iseid, primo Ethicorum, 
and for in pe comyn good singuler good is closed, 
alwey pe comune good scholde be set tofore pe singuler good. 
For we seen p a t a partie of pe bodie putteth itself 
to peril for pe hoole body 
as pe arme putteþ itself 
to peril for pe body, 
and by kynde intysyng whanne a man seep and perseyueth 
p a t pe membris scholde be iwounded 
o p e r ihert, 
in pe whiche membris stondeþ sauacioun of pe body, 
to saue al pe body 
pe arme putteth itself to peril; 
so gif we taken hede 
to olde tyme 
how som cite hadde lordschepe and reyned, 
p a t was for pe citeseyns spare[d] not to put hemself 
to peril of dep for pe comyn profit. 
And pe loue p a t pe Romayns 
hadde to pe comyn profit 
made Rome a princ[ipat]e and rayne. Panne in p i s wise al men scholde louye so 
p a t first and principalliche 
he scholde loue God 
and pe comyn profit, 
and by pe consequent folwyng, 
he schulde loue priuate and singuler good and profit. 
And p a t is most semelich 
to kynges and princes, 
and p a t we may declare 
by p r e weyes. 
For as we speken 
at p i s tyme, 
pe dignite of a kyng may be likned 
to p r e : \ t o tyraundise, 
to pe whiche a kyng is contrarie; 
to f. vertues, 
by pe whiche he schulde be ihigt; 
and to vices, 
pe whiche he schulde forsake. 
Pe friste wey is declared 
in p i s wise for, 
as it is iseid tofore 
and as pe philosofer 
preueth [in] Politic[is], 
a kyng and a tyrand ben diuerse. 
For a kyng loueth principalliche pe comune profit, 
and in louynge pe comune profit 
he loueth his owne profit; 
for gif pe r e g n e is saaf, 
pe r I kyng is saaf. 
But a tyraund doþ þe contrarie 
and loueth principaliche his owne profit, 
and, 
by þe consequent folwynge 
and by hap, he louefc þe comyn profit 
wherof cometh his owne profit. 
Panne for a kyng 
and a tyrant hauen contrarious maners, 
for þe manere of loue of a tyraunt settefc his awne profit 
tofore þe comyne profit 
and þe manere loue of a kyng scholde sette þe comyn profit 
tofore his owne profite; 
also for eche kyng and prince 
is in special manere Goddes seruant and a comyn persone: 
in a special manere it is semelich to kynges and princes 
to sette God 
and þe comyn profit 
tofore singuler profit. Pe seconde, 
þat is declared by consideracioun of vertues by þe whiche kynges and princes schulde be ihigt. 
For as defaute and lakke of connynge 
is worse in þe maister 
þan in þe desciple, 
for þe maister is in suche astaat 
in þe whiche he mot teche 
oþer men wit and connynge, 
so lacke and defaute of vertues 
is worse in þe kyng 
þan in sogettes 
for it longeth 
to his astaat 
to brynge oþer men to vertues. 
And among oþer thinges 
þat may brynge kynges to vertues, 
on is þat a loue principaliche God 
and þe comyn profit. 
For gif a kyng loueth principaliche God 
and þe comyn profit, he schal besiliche Studie 
to haue mynde of thinges 
þat ben apassed, 
and prouysioun and warnynge of fcynges 
þat schal come, 
| and þat he be expert and waar, 
and þat he haue al þat it col. 
nedeth to prudencia 
by þe whiche prudencia 
he may rule his puple. 
And gif he setteth þe comyn profit 
tofore singulare profit - 
þe more prudencia 
nedefc to saue þe comyn profit 
þan nedeth to saue þe singuler profit, 
þe more he scholde Studie 
to haue greet prudencia. 
Panne he schulde be prudens. 
Also he schulde be iuste, rigtfol, 
for þe comyn profit is most ikept 
and isaued by iusticia. 
And he schulde be magnanimus, 
for þe comyn profit is greet and wifc difficulté 
and ben worthi greet honour and worschep and magnanimus 
loueth greet honour and worschep. 
And he schulde be magnificus, 
for as þe philosofer meneth, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
magnificencia stondefc principaliche 
in seruice and worschep of God 
and in þe comyn profit. 
And he schal be fortis, 
for gif he settefc þe comyn profit 
byfore singulere profit, 
he spareth not to putte his owne persone to perile gif he se þat it is spedful to þe regne. 
He schal be temporatus; 
for gif his entencioun 
is occupied principalliche in profit of þe regne, 
he forsaketh and despiseth 
sencible and inmoderate delectacioun and likynge 
lest he be þerby ilette of besynesse and cure of þe regne. 
Panne for to take al for oon, 
loue o[f] good of God 
and of þe comyn profit, 
þat on bryngeth 
to alle vertues. 
Panne by consideracioun of vertues 
by þe whiche kynges scholde be higt þei scholde principalliche loue God and þe comyn profit. 
Pe fcridde, 
þe same is declared 
by consideracioun of vices 
þe whiche kynges schulle voyde and forsake. 
For as loue of God and þe comyn profit ledefc and bryngeth to alle vertues, 
so inmoderate loue of a manis The G o v e r 
n a n c e of K i n g s a n d Punces owne persone l e d e p and bryngeþ to alle vices 
-| for suche ben tirauntes f. 
and wollen folfille here owne lust and likyng and desiren singuler excellence and doun perfore wrong to o p e r men and stelen and robben holy thinges 
and spoilen pe poeple and vsen al vnrigtwisnesse. 
Perfore Valerius Maximus, 
de Dionisio Ciciliano, telleþ p a t p i s Dionisius of Cicilia, 
for he was a tiraunt and louede hymself, 
he destroyede and spoilede citees and townes 
and robbed holy places. 
For it is iseye how kynges and princes 
schal haue hemself in loue, 
for he schal principallich loue God 
and pe comyn profit, 
it may be sone iknowe 
how p 
e i scholde haue hemself in hate. 
For loue is pe firste steryng 
and pe first passioun 
and p e r 
o i cometh eche o p e r passioun; 
and gif a man loueth rigtwisnesse and trouthe, 
he hateth þeues p a t ben contrarie to rigtwisnesse and bac biters 
p a t ben contrarie to treuthe and to sothnesse. 
And for he loueth bodilich lif, 
he dredeþ pe swerd 
p a t benemeth pe lyf. 
Panne drede, and hate, 
and, schortlich, 
eche passioun 
and eche sturyng 
of pe soule springeth 
and cometh of loue. 
Panne ech man schuld haue principallich 
in his entent and mynde 
what is worthi 
to be loued. 
For it is declared how kynges and princes scholde 
in a special manere passynge 
o p e r e men loue God 
and pe comyn profyt, 
þanne in a special manere passynge 
o p e r e men 
þey scholde forsake and hatie thynges p a t ben contrarie to God 
and to pe comyn profit. 
And suche ben wrongful workes 
and dedes and despituous, 
and generalliche alle vices. 
Wherfore, 
for by cause p 
a t it is pe propretee 
of hate to destroye 
and not be apaied 
but he destroye 
as it is seid, 
ii [Rethor]icorum, 
þanne it is semelich p a t kynges and princes loue rigtwisnesse 
and hate vices so p a t he holde hemself not apaied 
but he | destroye vices. 
And men col. scholde not be destroyed and ihated for p e i ben men, 
but for vices scholde be destroyed and ihated. 
if vices may not oþer wise be destroied noþer pe comyn profit 
may o p e r wise dure 
but by destroyeng of euel doers, 
suche scholde be destroyed 
for pe comyn profit scholde not perische. 
Panne pe more comyn persones kynges and princes ben, 
pe more p e i schulde loue 
pe comyn profit 
and hatie euel doynges and dedes 
p a t ben contrarie to þe comyn profit. 
v Chapter IV [I]t is itreted of loue and of hate p 
a t ben pe firste passions, 
and it is to tretynge 
how kynges and princes scholde haue hemself in desire 
and habominacioun þat ben pe seconde passions. 
And desire is o p e r e p a n loue, 
and habominacioun is o p e r p a n hate. 
For moral doynge 
is som del liche 
to kyndeliche thinges; 
for as kyndelich body es by here owne fourmes, 
as by heuynesse and ligtnesse, 
fondeth to come to here owne place, 
so by loue man fondeþ to come to good 
p a t is proporcionate I and acordyng to hym. 
Panne in heuy bodyes 
oþe r liЗte 
þre þynges mot be knowe : firste , 
þe he uy fourme oþer liЗt by e whiche þei be 
n accordynge to hiЗe place s oþe r to lowe; 
þe se conde , 
þe me uynge by 
þe whiche he cometh 
in to suche a place; 
þe {þridde , 
þe abydyng and er styng by þe whiche he resteth 
in suche a place. 
And so in moral dedes and doyng, 
as it is comynliche ise ide , 
suche þre mot be iknowe . 
For whan we Þe rse yue 
n sum þyng þat is good, first, by loue and by sum ple sance we accorde n þerto; 
þe se conde , 
by de sire we fonden and come 
n þe rto; 
þe þridde , 
by dilectacioun we re ste 
n þe rinne . 
Panne loue accordeþvsvs 
and desire me 
ue th vs and delectacioun make þ vs haue re ste ; 
and what is iseid of good 
in compar­ isoun to loue 
and to de sire and to | delectacioun, 
as it is itouche 
d f. tofore, 
schal be vnde rstonde of e ue l in comparisoun to hate 
and to abhominacioun and to sorwe. 
As whan we loue 
n good we accorde n þe rto, 
and whanne we de sire 
n it we fonden to come þe rto, 
and whan we hauen it 
we hauen de le c­ tacioun and likynge þe rinne ­ so yue 
l þat is ihated, 
disple sid, 
and is contrarie to oure wylle , 
and Зif we hauin abominacion þe rof, 
we schoniþ and forsake þ it; 
and Зif we hauin hit, 
we ben sori þerfore. 
A n d þei de sire be not loue, 
Зit it scholde take mane 
re and me sure of loue; 
so þe i abhominacioun be not hate, 
Зut it schal take me sure of hate . 
And so we seeþ in kyndeliche þynge s þat [þei] 
þe me uyng dounward 
be not þe fourme 
of an he uy body, 
ut kynde liche þe me uyng dounward takeþ me sure and mane re of þe heuynesse 
so pat þe more he uy a body 
is þe more swiftliche it meueth dounward. 
Wherfore Зif we w o l knowe how kynge s and prince s schulde de­ sire thinge 
s and haue abhominacioun þe rof, 
it is to wetynge how þei scholde louye and hatie . 
A n d we s e e p 
in alle actus 
and de de s 
as it is preued, 
primo Polliticorum, 
þat þe e nde is de sire 
d wiþoute me sure . 
A n d þynges 
þat bryngeth vs to þe ende be 
n desired by þe manere and mesure of þe ende, 
as a fesician and a le che fonde p 
as moche as Þei may 
to brynge in helthe most and best pat he may; 
for helthe in þe art and craft of fesik is þe principale entent as þe e nde of doynge in pat art. 
A n d it is not here 
e nte nt to eue dre nche s and blood le tinge as mowche as þe y mowe , 
for þanne ‡he schulde sle e þe se ke ; 
but it is he re 
e nte nt to eue dre nche s 
and oþere me dicyns 
and lete blood 
by þe me sure of þe helthe. 
Panne , 
for in þe craft and art of re gnynge and of principate sauacioun 
of þe regne and of myt (powe r) and of þe principate 
is Þe principal and fynal e nte nt, 
as i n art of me dicine 
sauaci|oun of þe kyndelich body 
is þe principal e nte nt, 
it is semelich to col. kynges and princes to sette here 
e nte nt kyndeliche and principaliche to loue 
þe profit of þe regne 
and þe comyn profit. 
Wherfore if desire scholde take me sure of loue, 
principaliche kynges and prince s scholde loue [þe] good staat of þe regne so 
þat þei þat ben r T h e G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s

Panne he scholde desire cyuyle myt and powe r, riche sse ,

de de s and do suche de de s by þe whiche þe sauacioun of þe regne stonde þ. 
For it is iseie 
what and how kynge s and prince s schulde de sire 
(for as he scholde loue first and principalliche G 
o d and þe comyn profit, 
he schulde loue oþe re thinge s in so moche 
as þei ben ordeyned þe rto, 
so he scholde first and principalliche desire G 
o d and þe comyn profit; 
and oþere þat be n iorde yne 
d he rto be 
n de sire d by cause þat þe i be 
n iordeyned þe rto); 
þanne it may be sone iknowe of what thinge s and how þei schulde haue abhominacioun. 
For principalliche thinge s ‡ben abhominable 
þat be n expresse and opounliche aЗe nst G 
o d and þe comune profit, 
and oþe re þynge s be n abhominable 
by þe conse que nt folwynge. 
And þe more charge and besynesse þe [i] haue 
n in cure of þe regne 
and of þe comyn profit, 
þe more se me lich it is þat kynges and prince s haue suche abhomynacioun 
and suche de sire . 
A n d whiche it ben þat ke pe 
n and sauen þe re gne in good staat 
and h o w a kyng schulde haue hymse lf to þe regne, 
| it schal be declared more diffuse ­ 
f. lich in þe þridde book. Chapter V Princes Whanne we determinen of þe ordre 
of þe passions 
of þe saule, 
we se ide þat loue 
and hate be 
n þe firste passions, 
and desiderium and abhominacio be 
n þe secunde passions, 
and þe rafte r in þe þridde de gre ben hope and despeire. 
Panne it is to wetynge 
how kynges and prince s scholde haue he mse lf in hope 
and de spe ire . 
But [i]f al þat is ise id is clerliche vnde rstonde , 
it is no difficulte to wite and to knowe 
h o w kynge s and princes schulde 
haue he mse lf þe rinne . 
For it is iseid tofore 
þat it is semelich 
þat a kyng be humilis and mag­ nanimus; 
þanne , 
for humilite moderateth hope 
(for he þat is humilis knoweth his owne 
de faute and taketh not more hope and trist þan he scholde), 
and magnanimitas abate þ de spe ire and wanhope 
(for he þat is magnanimus take th no despeire for difficulte of dedes), 
‡Зifa kyng is humilis and magnanimus, 
he hopeth alwe y and tristeth in þyng 
þat is to tristynge inne 
by cause of magnanimite, 
[and] he se tte þ no hope and trist in þyng þat no trist is inne by cause of humilite. 
A n d we may declare in foure mane re wise 
þat it is semelich 
þat kynges and prince s hau 
e he mse lf we l and semelich in hope and trist, 
and hope and triste in þynges in þe whiche he sholde haue hope and trist, 
and auentre o n v I þynges on þe whiche he scholde ave ntre . 
For if kynggis and princis hope and trist i n no p i n g noþe r aue nture d i n no þing, 
þan he we re pusillanimus 
and tre tiþ not þe nedis of þe regne 
as he schulde. 
As it is comynliche ise id, 
pat in hope and i n trist foure 
most be iknowe 
by þe whiche we may argue pat it is semelich 
þat kynges and princes haue good hope and trist. 
For first, hope | is of good, 
for of euel col. 
is no hope but drede. 
P[e secondle, 
hope is in difficulte; 
for they in eche good 
may stonde loue and desire, 
ut hope may not stonde 
but in good 
w i p difficulte . 
For no man hope th but hym se me 
that it is hard and difficulte to come 
to þe good 
pat he hope th to haue . 
þridd e , 
hoÞe stonde th in good pat is to comyng; 
for of good pat is present is non hope , 
Þei þe rof come ioye and likynge. 
þe ferÞe, hope stonde þ in good pat is poscible and may be ; 
for inposcible good 
þat may not be no man 
hath hoÞe 
but de sÞe ire . 
A n d Þese foure ­ good, difficulte, to comynge, 
and poscible ­ scholde principaliche longe to kynge s and princes. 
For by cause þat kynge s euen lawe s 
(for þe philosofe r me ne th pat it longe 
th propre liche to kynge s and prince s 
to eue lawe s), 
þe rfore it is semelich pat thei haue hoÞe to good. 
Also, 
for þe principal e nte nt of a kyng pat eueth lawe , 
as it is iseid tofore, 
scholde be seruice and worschip of God, 
and for suche good is excellent and passyng good 
and with difficulte , 
þe entent of kynges and prince s 
scholde not oonlich be se t in good 
but also in excellent and passyng good. 
Also þe more þe cominte is Þe more happis he mai haue , 
and ne diþ þe rfore 
þe more avise me 
nt and prouisioun 
and warne sse s and þe better consaile . ‡Prouisioun, avise ­ ment, 
and warnesse is of þingis pat ben to cumminge for no man takiþ consaile of inpossible þingis pat mai not be, 
as þe philosofer meniþ, [iii] Ethicorum. 
A n d , v i Ethicorum, 
þe philosofe r me ne th pat thinges 
p a t ben apasse d be n inmutable and mowe not chaunge 
and þe rfore he falle th not vnder counseile noþe r vnde r prouisioun and avisement and warnesse. 
Pat is semelich pat kynges and princes knowe good not onliche for it is e xce lle nt and passynge good and wiþ difficulte, 
but also for it is to comynge. 
| Also he scholde knowe and take he e de of suche good for it 
f. is poscible. 
For pore me 
n pat ben of [no] powe r and vnworthi, 
þ o u З h e be [not] magnanimi 
and þ e i З 
a we thdrawe he m fro som maner good pat is passyng e xce lle nt and wiþ difficulte , 
it se me th pat þey ben excused 
for hem lacken riche sse and cyuyle myt and power and worthinesse of blood to doo suche good. 
But kynges and prince s Jat haue 
n worthine sse of blood, 
cyuyle myt and powe r, 
and gre t faculte and riche sse se me th ine xcusable 
if Þei ben pusillanimes and trowe 
n not Jat 
it is poscible to hem to doo swiche e xce lle nt and passyng gode 
pat is worþ 
gre t honour and worsche p. Pan, 
for kynges and princes schulde se t here 
e nte nt in excellent and passyng good 
and be avise d r wherof good Jat is to comynge and poscible to Þe regne, it is semelich pat 
Þei haue good hope and trist by magnanimite 
for pei hauen alpatit nedeth to pewe hope and trist. 
It is iseie how kynges and princes schulde haue hem wel in hope of thing 
Þat is to hopynge; 
panne it is to wetynge 
how pei schul haue hemself 
in not hopyng of thing 
pat is not to hopynge, 
for he schulde with greet besynesse 
to inquyre 
what he scholde hoÞe 
and in what doynge he scholde auentre. 
For as by magnanimite 
Þei scholde be redy and prest to auenture 
in excellent and passyng doynge and to hoÞe what he scholde hoope, 
so by humilite Ipei scholde be moderate so Jat Dei auntren not in doynge 
Jsat passen here owne mygt and strengte and so Ipat J 
e i hope not 
what is not to hopynge. 
And by twey weyes we may preue Jat kynges 
and < princes schulde auenture hemself 
as in goodnesse schewyng 
to alle oper sogettes, 
for foly hardynesse of hem myt destrue manye. 
And kynges and> | princes col. scholde not auentre in doyng pat passeth here owne myt and strengte 
noÞer hath more hope 
Þan he scholde. 
Þe firste wey is itake 
by IÞe office of IÞe kyng; 
Þe seconde by Þe puple. 
For to hope more passyng ban he schulde hope 
and auenture in doynge pat passeth here 
myt and strengthe cometh of foly 
oper of sum inmoderat passion. 
Þerfore, ii Rethoricorum, 
it is iwrete at children 
ben alwey of good hoope in al doyng. 
Þei it be aenst hem and passinge here myte and strengthe, 
children hauen good hope 
and at comet of folie, 
for IÞei Jat ben not expert knoweth not difficultre of dedes. 
Also it may hapÞe 
Þat it cometh ofte [of] inmoderate passioun, 
for in children is moche hoÞe 
ey he saye sum doyng Jat Þey may not brynge to ende. 
A n d so we may say Jat dronkene men hauen more hoÞe pan Dei schulde, 
for Þei ben hote with wyne and lese Þe vse of resoun by dronkenesse 
and fondeth to do sum doyng pat Þei mo we not brynge to ende. 
Panne for IÞe office of kyng nedeÞ and requireth man 
Þat is prudent 
and not passionate 
by inmoderate passioun, 
it is semelich Jat kynges and princes scholde not auentre in doyng <werkis> 
and dedes Þat passen here owne myt 
and strengte noÞer hoÞe 
what is not to hopynge. 
Þe seconde, 
at it is semelich to hem 
by cause of IÞe puple: 
for comynliche he 
Þat auentureth in doynge pat passeth his owne myt 
and strengte putteÞ hymself to peril. 
if it is inconuenient to putte al e men and al IÞe regne <in subieccioun and> to Þeril 
(<and ‡Þerforeit is semelich

r v I Chapter VI The philosofre, iiii Ethicorum, 
meneth pat in ewes 
and in moral matere singuler consideracions profiteth most. 
A n d for thinges 
pat ben confuse and general ben most iknowe to vs, 
as it is iseid, 
primo Phisicorum, 
Þerfore in p i s firste book 
tretyng of maneres 
and ewes of kynges, 
we mote passe generalliche and bi figures and by liknesse; 
for in Þe seconde book, 
and namliche in Þe fcridde, 
we schal more descende 
to particuler circumstaunces. 
But it is sÞedful to passe Þes vniuersales, 
for knowleche heere of schal brynge vs to knowleche of thinges 
Þat folweth. 
A n d in Þe Dridde 
n a more particuler manere 
we schal trete of doynge of kynges; 
but it is not sÞedful 
to descende alle to particulers, 
for IÞei Jat knowen Þe manere of courtes, 
and namelich kynges and princes, 
knowen particuler doyng 
atte IÞe folle by ofte vse 
and sigt of suche doyng. 
Wherfore if sum vniuersal lore is igeue to hem in morale matere 
by hope of exÞerience 
Þ a t Þ e i hauen in moral doyng and dedes, 
Þei mowe be itaugt 
atte Þe fulle in knowleche of morale matere. 
Panne for Þis is iseide, 
sey we pat as we hauen generalliche 
and by liknesse [itaugt kynges and princes] 
how Þei scholde haue hemself 
in hoÞe and desÞeyre pat stonde Þ in good Jat is to comynge, 
so by Þe same wey we may teche hem 
how j e i schulde | haue hemself in drede col 
and in hardinesse pat stondefc in euel pat is to comynge. 
A n d in cas som men wolde wene pat kynges and princes schulde neuere drede, 
for Þei m e n e p pat suche doyng were agenst 
Þe maieste of a kyng. 
A n d ofte kynges hauen men pat teilen hem 
so and maken hem euidenses 
to be hardy 
in alle dedes 
and no thing drede. 
But suche fiaters ben false, 
for he techeth pat kynges and princes schulde not be fortes; 
for as it is iseid, 
primo Magnorum Moralium, 
he Jat is hardy 
in al doyng 
and dredeth no thing is not fortis but he is a fole. 
Pan it nedij to wite 
in what maner wise 
Þei schuld be ferful and hardi, 
for moderat drede is sÞedful to kingis and princis leste 
‡eny fingis schulde arise in J e londe and in Je regne pat mygte 
aÞeire good Staat Þevof. 
A n d as it longeth 
to p i s doyng, 
by twey weyes we may preue pat 
Þe moderat drede is nedfol to kynges and to princes. 
Þe firste wey is itake 
by counseile pat scholde be take 
and Þe seconde by dede pat scholde be do. 
Þe firste wey is declared in p i s wise, 
for as it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
capitulo De Timore, 
drede axeth counsaile 
and maketh men axe counsaile. 
if a man dredeth, 
he axeth counsaile 
how he may ascaÞe Þe euel 
and Þe harme pat he dredeth. 
Panne for oon hool regne 
may not be wel ireuled 
withoute greet counsaille, 
it is sÞedful pat kynges and princes haue som moderat drede Jat Þei haue occasioun to axe 
and to take good counsail. 
Þe seconde, 
we may preue Þe same by doyng j 
a t scholde be do. 
For it is not inow to axe and to take counsaile and deme by J e counsaile pat is ieue | 
but we do Þewlich and bisiliche by J e counsaille and f. dome 
f a t is ieue. 
A n d moderate drede maketh vs not onlich axe counsaille, 
but also it makij us werche besiliche. 
For if we hauen moderate drede, 
we werchen bisiliche and don thinges 
by IÞe whiche we trowen to voyde pat drede. 
Panne it is declared pat kynges and princes schulde haue moderat drede; 
nathales, 
ei scholde in no wise haue inmoderat drede. 
For in inmoderate drede ben foure 
fcat ben al aoenst IÞe regne and agenste 
J e kyng. 
For inmoderat drede maketh a man 
astonied and ischronke. 
Þe seconde, 
it maketh hem to ax no counsaile. 
Þe Þridde, 
it maketh hym to tremle and to quake. 
Þe ferÞe, 
it maketh hym vncouenable. 
For a man whanne he dredeth 
t e blood draweth inward; 
for e same manere Jat we seen in men, 
we may see in hete of kyndelich body. 
For whanne men dreden in feeldes, 
anon he fleeth to castellis 
o e r to tours; 
and whanne me dredeth, 
J e heete Jat is in IÞe ottere membris fleen anon in to o e r e membris. 
Þerfore a man is ischronke and istonyed in hymself. 
Wherfore, 
if it is vnsemelich 
Jat e kyng Þat is heed of f e regne be ischronke and astonied, 
it is vnsemelich 
Jat he haue inmoderat drede. 
Þe secunde, 
Þat is vnsemelich 
for inmoderate drede maketh a man not axe noÞer take consaille. 
For whan a man is in inmoderate drede, 
he is al astonied, 
in agonie and strif, 
and woot not what he schal do 
and hath Þerfore no mynde of counsaille. 
A n d if men eueth hym counsaille, 
he vnderstondeth it not for he is so astonyed. 
Wherfore if it is vnsemelich 
Þat nedes and dedes of IÞe regne be do withoute | 
co counsaile and fcat IÞe kyng be withoute counsaille, 
it is vnsemelich 
Þat he haue inmoderat drede. 
Þe Þridde, 
inmoderat drede maketh a man tremle and quake. 
For by cause of drede J e hete passeth inward and J e outward membris 
abideth colde, 
Ipaln] ben IÞe synwes ikeled 
and mowe not susteyne IÞe membris; 
wherfore he trembleth and quaketh. 
Panne if it is inconuenient tat a kyng tremble and quake tat schulde be manlich and stedefast, 
it is inconuenient Jat he haue drede inmoderate. 
Þe ferje, 
inmoderat drede maketh a man vncouenable, 
for by inmoderat drede a man quaketh 
and is astonyed 
and inconuenable 
and woot not 
what he schal do. Panne, 
for al IÞe regne stondeth 
in IÞe kyng, 
as in hym at meueth, 
and abideth his hestes and commaundementes 
if e kyng is vncouenable 
and may not hoote and commaunde 
[for inmoderat drede], 
it is preiudicium, 
at isdesease, 
to al j e regne. 
Wherfore if it is vnsemeliche, 
a kyng schulde not haue inmoderat drede. 
It is iseie how kynges schulde haue hemself in drede, 
for it is more difficulte to abate drede Joanne moderat hardinesse 
as it is iseie tofore, 
I capitulo De Fortitudine; 
it may be sone iknowe 
how IÞey schulde haue hemself in hardinesse, 
for j e i scholde not 
haue inmoderate hardinesse. 
For inmoderat hardinesse 
maketh a man take more vppoun hym 
Þan he scholde and Jat 
is not spedful to kynges, 
for Jeanne |Dei wolde putte al De regne to peril. 
And if a man hap noon hardinesse in al wise, 
pat is [vnlsemelich for Jeanne he auentureth to no doynges and dedes. 
Panne in alle wyse 
it is semelich pat kynges | 
and princes haue hemself 
f. moderatlich in hardinesse and drede. Chapter VII 
For it semeth pat wrethe hath most affinite with hate, 
ar we declare how kynges and princes schulde haue hemself 
in wreth and mansuetudo, 
it is to wetyng 
how wrethe and hate ben diuerse 
and whether of hem tweyne is worse - 
wraÞ ofcer hate inordinate. 
A n d p e r e is oon principal diuersete bitwene wrathe and hate, 
for hate is appetite and desire 
oÞer wyllyng of harme withoute condicioun, 
for hate is contrarie to loue. 
And, 
as it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
it is al one to loue 
and wilne good to som man 
by cause of hymself; 
so hate is to wilne harme to som man 
by cause of hymself. 
A n d it is not so of wrathe, 
for wrathe is not apÞetite 
of harme in itself 
but in ordre to wreche. 
And wrethe may be diffined 
and discreued in is wise: 
wrethe is apÞetite of payne in wreche. 
Of p i s principal diuersite 
bytwene wrethe and hate ben itake 
eigte diuersetees Þe whiche Þe philosofer asigneth, 
ii Rethoricorum. 
Þe firste diuersetee 
is for wreth cometh of thinges 
pat toucheth a man hymself 
oÞer of thinges 
pat toucheth thinges 
pat Þerteyneth to hymself, 
and hate may come of thinges 
pat longeth to hymself 
and to o e r e . 
For no man is wroth to anofcer 
but he trowe 
pat he hath itrespassed to hymself 
oÞer to his children 
oÞer to his frendes 
oÞer t o som oÞer 
p a t longeth to hym. 
For it is iseid 
pat wrethe is apÞetite of Þeyne not sympleliche, 
but in ordre to wreche; 
and no man is wroth to anojer 
but for trespas ido to hymsilf 
oÞer to oÞer pat longeth to hym. 
A man hateth a n o e r 
for he is euel in hym|silf, 
oÞer t o oÞere pat longeth to hymself, 
o e r to oÞer. col. 
For anon as we knowen pat a man is euel - 
as whanne we knowen Jat a man is a Þef - 
we may hate hym 
whether he trespace to vs oÞer to oÞere. 
Þe seconde diuersite 
is for alwey 
wrethe is in Þe singuler and sÞecial, 
and hate may be in comyn; 
for a man may hate alle Þefes 
in comyn and alle bak biters 
but he may not be wroth 
but to sum sÞecial oon oÞer manye. 
For Þe comynte of men 
d o p vs no wrong, 
but alwey Þe wrong 
folweth sum sÞecial man oÞer men. 
Þei we may hate endeles manye peues, 
we ben not wroth 
but to sum synguler and special. 
v Þe pridde diuersite, 
for hate hath neuer inow 
but wrethe may haue inow; 
for if hate is apÞetite 
of harme sympleliche, 
he pat we haten 
may not haue so moche harme but we wolle pat he hadde more. 
But wrethe is apÞetite of Þeyne, 
not sympleche, 
but as it is iordeyned 
to wreche and may haue inow; 
for whanne a man 
is so greetliche iÞeyned 
pat he pat is wrooth holde hymself awreke 
at Þe folle, 
panne wrethe hath inowg and seseth. 
Þe ferthe diuersete is for he Þat is wroth 
w o l make soro, 
but [he] pat hateth 
w o l desire noye and harme; 
and he pat is wrooth 
w o l do smette and sorwe, 
but he pat hateÞ wol do damage and noyge. 
Þe fifte diuersete 
is he pat is wrojs wol pat sorwe be knowe, 
and he pat hatep recchep not. 
For it is not inow to hym 
pat is wroÞ pat 
Þe oÞer hafc harm 
but if a feled 
and but it be oponlich 
iknowe pat Þe oÞer hap IÞe harm by hym, 
for ellis it were no wreche. 
But he pat hateth reccheth not, 
for by cause pat hate is apÞetite of harm sympleliche and withoute condicioun, 
it is inow to hym pat hateth pat Þe oÞer haue harm 
how euere he be come | Þerto. f. 
Þe sexte diuersete is for wrethe 
is alwey with woo and sorwe, 
for he pat is wroth is so wo 
but wreche be do pat he is alwey 
as it were in sorwe 
forto he haue take wreche. 
But hate may be withoute sorwe, 
for we may hate thinges in comyne; 
for we may hate generaliche alle Þeues, 
but it n e d e p not pat sorwe 
folowe suche hate. 
Þe seuenfÞe diuersite 
is for it semeth pat mercye 
is annexed to wrethe and not to hate. 
For whanne wrethe hath ynow 
if Þe oÞer hath moche harme, 
p a n he pat is wrooth hath mercye on hym. 
But hate hath no maner mercie 
for it may not haue inowg. 
Þe eigte diuersite 
is for wrathe wol pat Þe oÞer haue harme for his trespace. 
For it is inow to hym pat is wrooth pat Þe oÞer haue harme 
and be ponysched forto he haue fol wreche. 
But hate destroieÞ 
and wol vndo hym pat hatep, 
for it is not inow to hym pat hatep pat Þe oÞer haue harme 
but he wol pat Þe oÞer be destroyed and vndo. 
Panne for Þe condicions of hate ben moche worse panne Þe condicions of wrethe, 
it nedeth more to be war of hate 
panne of wrethe 
and to be war pat wrathe passe not in to hate; 
for pat is to make a berne of a strowe, 
as Austyn wol mene. 
Panne al men schulde be war of hate and nameliche kynges and princes 
for Þei mowe greue and noye manye men. 
And so we knowen Þe difference 
bytwene hate 
and wrethe for hate is worse 
p a n wrethe. 
Nathales if wrethe is inordinate, 
it is worse. 
Panne for to knowe how kynges and princes schulde haue hemself in wrethe and in Þe passioun 
pat hatte mansuetudo, 
it is to wetyng 
pat som tyme wrethe passeth resoun 
and isÞeanneinor| dinate 
and it is good to be war col. Þerof; 
and som tyme it folweth 
Þe ordre of resoun 
and may Jeanne be ordinate 
and good to folwyng. 
For if wrethe passeth reson it nedeth to r I be war Þer of in twey maner wise: first, 
for it huyreth not resoun parfitliche; 
Þe secounde, 
for it dymmeth and blyndeth resoun. 
For, vii Ethicorum, 
Þe philosofer seith pat wrethe pat passeth resoun is ilikned to houndes oÞer to swifte oÞer 
to rabbysche seruauntes and hasty; 
for hasty and rabbische seruantes, 
anon as Þei heren 
Þe word of here lord, 
ar Þey wete rediliche and knowe 
Þe heste of here lord, 
Þey rennen rabbischeliche 
to do his heste. 
Wherfore it hapÞeth hem to do amys 
for Þei knowen not parfitliche 
how Þei schulde do pat heste. 
Also houndes, 
anoon as Þei huren noyse of oon pat cometh, 
Þey berken and distyngueth 
not whethere he pat cometh 
is frend ojÞer foo. 
A n d so d o p wrethe; 
for anon as resoun meneth pat wreche schulde be do, 
anon wrethe w o l renne to take 
wreche not abydynge in pat caas Þe doom of resoun 
how and in what wise 
pat wreche schulde be itake. 
Panne it nedeth to be war of inordinate 
wrethe for it 
huyreth not resoun parfitliche. 
Þe seconde, 
it nedeth to be war of inordinate 
wrethe for it dymmeth and blyndeth resoun. 
For whanne Þe body is distempred, 
we ben ilette of vse of resoun; 
wherfore, 
whanne Þe wrethed blood cometh 
vp to Þe herte, 
Þe body is distempred so 
pat we may not Þewliche vse resoun. For Þey resoun 
and vnderstondyng 
be not a bodilich vertu, 
nerÞelees it vseth 
in his doyng bodilich membris and lemys. 
Wherfore if Þe body is distempred, 
resoun | may not frelich vse his owne doynge. 
Wherfore f. 
if eche man schulde be war of blyndyng 
of his resoun 
and [not] be ful obedient to resoun, 
eche man scholde be war of inordinate 
wrethe and namliche kynges and princes 
for Þei scholde most folwe Þe heste of resoun. 
But ‡wrethe may be ordinate and worthi to be folwed, 
if it folweth Þe heste of resoun; 
for wrapce is an instrument of resoun and d o p 
Þe heste of resoun and vertuous dedes mytiliche and strongliche. 
Þerfore, [iii] Ethicorum, 
Homerus is alowed pat seide pat vertue leuyeth in woodnesse, 
for p a n a vertue lyueth in wodnesse oÞer in wrejÞe in Þew manere 
and as it scholde whanne wrethe is instrument of vertue and of resoun. 
Pan it is iknowe 
how we scholde haue vs in wrethe and in Þe passioun pat hatte mansuetudo, 
for pat passioun abateth wrethe 
pat it passeth not Þe dome of resoun, 
and wrethe abateth mansuetudo 
pat it letteÞ not werkes of vertues and of resoun. 
Ar we deme at Þe fulle by resoun 
whaat is to doynge, 
we scholde be mansueti; 
but after Þat we knowen 
what is to doyng, 
we may take wrethe 
as Þe seruant of resoun 
pat w e may Jserby do mytiliche 
Þe heste of resoun. 
Panne Þe more semelich 
it is for kynges and princes be not ilet 
in vse of resoun 
and in doynge strongliche Þe doom of resoun, 
Þe more semeliche it is pat 
Þei haue hemself so in wrethe and in mansuetudo. 
T h e G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s Chapter VIII 
It is iseide tofore 
þat delectacioun and sorwe ben i 
n þ e laste degree 
in þe ordre of passiouns, 
for to hem as to þe laste passions 
and at hem al oþere passions endeth; 
for þer is no passioun 
but it ende at delectacioun 
oþer at sorwe. 
Panne for it is iseid | 
and itreted of alle col. oþere passions, 
it is to spekyng 
and to tretyng 
how kynges and princes scholde haue hemself in delectacioun 
and in sorwe. 
And of delectaciouns was double opynyoun among men 
in oolde tyme, 
as þe philosofer seith, 
x Ethicorum. 
Eudoxius seide þat eche delec­ tacioun is good, 
and what al men desiren semeth most good 
and most worthi to be chose; 
and alle thinges desiren delectacioun and likynge, 
and it were not so 
but delectacioun were good of itself. 
And hereto Eudoxius made anoþer resoun by sorwe 
þat is contrarie to delecta­ cioun, 
and made his resoun in þis wise: 
зif eche sorwe is worthi 
to be forsake 
and hath proprete 
of iuel and of harme, ‡ech delectacioun is worthi 
to be chose 
and hath proprete of good and of profit. 
And oþere menede þe contrarie and seide þat al delectacioun is euel. 
But þei þat dampneth 
alle delectaciouns scheweth anon 
þat here 
awne possessioun is fals; 
for þe philosofer seith þat withoute delecta­ cioun may no man leue. 
Panne as he þat denyзeth speche graunteþ speche, 
as þe philosofer, 
iiii M ethaphisicorum, 
so he þat seith þat al delectacioun is euel 
seith þat som delectacioun is good. 
For speche may not be denyed 
but by speche; 
þanne he þat denyeth speche speketh and graunteth speche in spekynge; 
wherfore зif he denyeth speche, 
in þe denyynge he graunteþspeche. 
So for no man denyeth al delectacioun and likynge 
but he haue delectacioun 
in þe forsakyng 
of alle delectaciouns and likynge, 
þanne it folweth 
þat he þat forsaketh al likynge 
cheseth sum delectacioun and likynge. 
And bytwene thes twey weyes 
þat ben al contrarie, 
‡þe philosoferis wey is I mene; 
for he seith þat not al delectacioun is good of itself 
noþer f. al delectacioun is euel of itself. 
But sum delectacioun is good in dede, 
and sum delectacioun semeth good, 
and sum is good of itself, 
and sum is good for sum what elles, 
and sum ‡is good for oon man, 
and som for anoþer. 
For as we seyen and deme in taste 
and in appetite, 
for in som men þe tast is infecte 
as in sek men 
and in sum men 
þe [tast] 
is wel disposid 
as in hoole men, 
so in sum men þe appetit is infecte 
as in vicious men 
and is in som men wel desposed 
as in vertuous men and goode men. 
Panne as not al þyng 
is verrey swete þat semeth swete to seke men and to hem þat hauen þe tast infecte 
but what semeth swete to hole men 
and to hem þat hauen þe tonge wel desposed, 
so not thinges þat ben delectable 
and likynge to vicious men 
and to hem 
þat hauen appetite infecte ben verrey delectable 
and likyng but thinges 
þat ben r I delectable 
and likyng to gode men 
and to hem pat hauen ritful w i l . 
Pan som kynges ben verrei delectable 
and likynge and of hemself 
and som semef delectable and likynge; 
and so som delectacioun is good in dede and of itself and som semeth good 
and for som what elles. 
Also, 
for delectacioun cometh of hauyng of thing 
pat is accordyng, 
garnie for some thinges 
accordeth to bestes 
and som to men, 
sum delectacions acordeth to bestes 
and som to men. 
A n d intellectual delectacions and vertuous accorden to men, 
but sencible delectaciouns 
and delectacions 
and likynge of lecherie accorden to bestes. 
A n d if man schal vse suche delectacions and likynge, 
pat is not onliche 
by cause of suche delectacioun 
but for Þei ben iordeyned 
and seruen to vertuous dedes. 
Panne it is iknowe how we | schul haue vs in delectaciouns and col. likynge. 
For by cause pat eche man schulde hate 
to be viciouse 
and to haue bestial maneres, 
eche man scholde not folwe thinges 
pat ben likynge to bestes 
and to vicious men. 
Panne eche delectacioun is good 
as Þe forsaid resons preueth 
but not eche delectacioun 
is good 
to alle men and bestes, 
but sum is good to bestes 
and som to men. 
Panne Þe more kynges and princes scholde hatie to lyuye as bestes, 
Þe more Þei scholde hate to folwe delectacioun bestial. 
Panne it is iknowe how kynges and princes scholde haue hemself in delectacioun: 
for principaliche and for itself 
Þei schulde haue delectacioun in vertuous dedes 
for alwey delectacioun makep couenable dedes 
Þe more sÞedful and p[ar]fit. 
Panne if kynges and princes hauen likynge in dedes of prudencia, 
pat is wisdom and vertuous workes, 
in Þe more sÞedful manere 
and Þe more parfitliche 
Þei mowe do suche workes and dedes; 
for Þe more delectacioun a man 
h a p in vertuous dedes 
Þe more excellentliche 
he d o p pilke dedes. 
A n d he schulde not principaliche haue delectacioun in sencible dedes 
but he schulde vse hem moderatliche in so moche as Þei ben ordeyned to vertuous dedes; 
for if suche delectaciouns ben stronge, 
Jeanne he letteth vertuous dedes. 
It is iseie how kynges and princes schulde bere hemself 
in delectacioun and likynge; 
now it is to wetynge 
how Þei scholde haue hemself in sorwe. 
A n d sorwe is neuere to takyng 
bot it be for foule doyng; 
for if a man knoweth 
pat he hath do foule dedes and vile, 
Þerfore he schulde be wo and sory. 
For by cause of foule dedes and doynge 
man scholde be sory, 
but alle oÞer sorwe schulde | be moderate and forsake, 
f. i Panne 
for to moderat suche sorwe, 
remedies schal be eue 
by Þe whiche suche sorwe may be voided. 
A n d it semeth pat Þe philosofer toucheth 
p r e e remediis by Þe whiche sorwe may be voided. 
Þe p r e remedies ben vertues, frendes, and consideracioun of Þe sojÞe 
and of Þe treu the. 
By vertues, sorwe is voided, 
for as Þe philosofer meneth, 
ix Ethicorum, 
euel men and vicious hauen no ioye of hemself 
for Þei fynden in v hemself 
no thing where of Þey mow haue likyng; 
for euel men ben enemyes to hemself 
and striuen with hemself 
as it is iseide. 
Þerefor Þei demen oon 
by resoun and d o p 
Þe contrarie by passioun, 
wherfore pei hauen no pes in hemself and hauen Þerfore no ioye of hemself. 
Panne for to haue likyng in vssilf, 
it is a greet remedie 
to voide vices and haue vertues. 
Þe seconde remedie 
is confort of frendes, 
as it is iseid. 
Þerefor it semeth pat sorwe 
is a certeyn wit 
oÞer heuynesse 
p a t greueth Þe saule. 
Panne as in bodiliche heuynesse 
oÞer in wit we ben pe lasse igreued with pat wifot] opere bercene 
[whanne manye helÞen vs beren it], 
so whanne we seen many frendes sory 
for vs we ben iligted of pat sorwe 
and ben Þe lasse sory. 
Þei pis resoun be itouched, 
ix Ethicorum, 
it it is iseid 
pat it was Platoes resoun 
and p i s resoun semeth not al trewe. 
For we schulde be sory 
for sorwe of oure frendes. 
Panne whanne we seeth oure frendes sory, 
it semeth pat oure sorwe 
scholde be Þe more 
and not Þe lasse. 
A n d we may also seye pat whanne we seeth oure frendes sory for oure sorwe, 
oure sorwe is not Þe lasse forÞeiben sory. 
But for we seeth hem sory, 
we hauen | stedfast fantasie and trist col. p 
a t Þei ben oure frendes; 
and for it is likynge to haue frendes, 
we hauen likynge 
and by pat likynge oure sorwe 
is Þe lasse for al likynge doo) 
awey al sorwe 
or maketh it Þe lasse. 
Þe pridde remedye is consideracioun, 
pat is bythenkyng, 
of s o p nesse and of trowÞe. 
ForÞeywe schulde be sory 
for foule workes and dedes, 
ut for worldlich catel and richesse pat we may haue and lese so 
pat we do no foule dedes 
we schulde not be sory. 
A n d herto Þe beste remedye 
is Þe consideracioun of sothnesse and of trouthe. 
For by such consideracioun we knowen pat suche good and catel 
is but litel worthi, 
Þerfore [pei] 
we lesen suche good and catel, 
we schulde not be sory 
but it happe for som what ellis 
in so moche 
as by lost Þerof 
we ben ilette of vertuos workes and dedes. 
Panne it is iknowe pat we scholde not be sory bote 
for foule doyng and vicious. A n d if we hauen sorwe for oÞer thinges, 
it scholde be voided by vertues oÞer by frendes oÞere by knowynge of Þe sothe and of Þe trouÞe. 
A n d ofte herto [is] iordeyned 
Þe ferÞe helÞe pat stondeth 
in bodilich remedies 
as sleep, pathyng, 
and oÞere suche pat ofte d o p awey sorwe. 
Panne, 
for suche sorwe 
letteth vertuous werkes and dedes, 
Þe more semelich it is pat kynges and princes schulde be excellent and passe 
oÞer men 
in vertuous workes and dedes, 
Þe more semelich it is pat kynges and princes apate and putte of suche sorwe. Chapter IX 
As twelf vertues ben irekened tofore of Þe whiche foure ben principal and eite ben 
as it were anexed, 
so among Þes twelf passions 
pat I ben irekened 
(folwynge pe lore of oure predeces|sours) 
we may say f. pat foure ben principale 
as hoÞe, drede, ioie and sorwe. 
A n d by p[r]e weyes we may preue pat Þes ben more principale 
p a n oÞere: first, 
by comparisoun to oÞere passions; 
Þe seconde, 
by comparisoun to Þe obiectis 
(pat is castyng to) 
and to Þe mater of Þe 
whiche he stondefr Þe pridde, 
by comparisoun to Þe mytful vertues of Þe sow[l]e 
in Þe whiche Þei ben inne for Þei ben 
in Þe irascible, wrethful, 
and Þe concupiscible, coueitise. 
r Þe firste wey is declared in p i s wise, 
for alle oÞere passions semen iordeyned to Þese passions; 
for Þe passions pat ben itake 
in comparisoun to good semen iordeyned to ioie 
and to hoÞe, 
and Þe passions pat ben itake 
in comparisoun to euel 
and to harme semeth iordeyned to drede and to sorwe. 
For p e passioun pat is i t a k e in comparisoun to good bygynneth first at loue and passeth peanne in to desire 
and endeth in hoÞe 
while good is to comynge, 
and endeth atte laste in ioye 
and in delectacioun 
whan pat good is igete and is present. 
A n d in comparisoun to [euel] 
and to harm 
Þe passioun bygynneÞ 
at hate and passeth in to abhominacioun 
while pat euel and harme is to comynge, 
[and endeth atte laste in sorwe] 
if pat euel is come and is present. 
Panne drede and sorwe 
ben also passions principale, 
for to hem ben iordeyned two passions pat b e n itake in comparisoun to euel and to harme as Þe passions pat ben itake 
in comparisoun to good ben iordeyned to hope and to ioye. 
Þe seconde wey for to preue pat 
Þes passions ben pryncipal may be take by Þe matiere in Þe whiche he stondeth, 
for eche passioun is itake 
in comparisoun to good oÞer t o euel. 
Also good oÞer euel 
is to comyng | 
col o p e r it is present, 
and perby pis foure passions ben itake: 
for of good pat is to comyng is hoÞe, 
and of good pat is present is ioye; 
and of euel and harme pat is t o comyng is drede, 
and of euel 
and harme pat is present is sorwe. 
In Þe ]pridde manere Þes passions may be take 
in comparisoun to Þe potencial vertues of Þe soule 
as in comparisoun to Þe irascible 
and to Þe concupiscible 
in Þe whiche Þei ben inne. 
A n d it is iseid pat Þe concupiscale (Þe coueitouse) 
taketh heed to good 
and to euel 
for it is good 
oÞer euel, 
and Þe irascible 
(pat is wrethful) 
taketh hede Þerto 
for it is w i p difficulte. 
Panne, 
for som good is most good whanne it is igete 
and gerinne stondeth delectacioun, delit and ioye, 
and euel and harme is worst 
whan it is come and gerinne stondep 
w o a n d sorwe, delit and sorwe 
mot be principal passions of Þe coueitous. 
A n d for Þe wrethful taketh hede 
and knoweth good and euel 
Þat is with difficulte, 
and for in good is acounted most difficulte 
whan it is to comyng and perof is hope, 
and [for] of euel pat is 
t o comynge is drede, 
hope and drede ben principal passions of pe irascible. 
T h e G o v e r n a n c e of K 
i n g s a n d Princes 
And for of passions cometh dyuersite of oure workes and dedes, 
it is semelich 
Þe we take bisiliche hede 
wherof we schulde haue ioye, delectacioun, 
oÞer sorwe and wherof 
we schulde haue hope and drede. 
A n d pat is pe more semlich [for] kynges and princes, 
in so moche as here dedes and workes 
ben more worthi and longeth 
to pe comyn profit. 
A n d kynges and princes 
scholde haue hemself peuliche 
in delectacioun and sorwe, 
in hope and in drede, 
as it is declared by IÞe forseid chapitres. Chapter X 
Tofore ben twelf passions | yrekened pat ben loue, hate, desire, ab- f. hominacioun, sorwe, delit, hope, despeire, drede, hardinesse, wrethe and methnesse. 
But al withoute Þese passions, 
i i Rethoricorum, 
it semeth pat IÞe philosofer 
rekeneth sex opere passions 
pat ben icleped elus, gratia (loue or envie, and grace), nemesis 
(pat is to menyng indignacioun of prosperite of euel men), misericordia (mercie), envie, and schamefastnesse and scorne. 
And alle Þe passions ben reducte and ibrout 
to som of pe forseide twelf passions, 
for gelus and gratia ben ibrout 
and reducte to loue; 
verecundia (schamefastnesse) to drede; 
inuidia (enuye), 
and misericordia (mercie), 
and nemesis ( 
p a t is indignacioun of prosperite of euel men) 
ben reducte to sorwe. 
For elus (gelesi) is reducte to loue 
for elus (gelusi) 
is nout elles 
but a strong loue. 
And kynges pat we louen stronglich, 
sum ben corporal and bodiliche 
and sum ben incorporai, 
not bodilich but spiritual and gostlich; 
and if IÞei ben corporal, 
for som men hauen suche thinges 
and han oÞer not, 
Þerfore in comparisoun 
to suche thinges elus 
is ofte diffined oper descreuid in pis wise: 
elus is strong loue 
and suffreth no felowschipe 
ne partener in Þe fcyng pat is iloued. 
But in comparisoun to spiritual thinges strong loue is good and ipreysed 
and is as it were comyne; 
for neuere man is vertuous 
noper loueth properliche vertues 
if he w o l not haue felowschiÞe in vertues. 
A n d suche elus 
in comparisoun 
to worschepful good is discreued 
b i IÞe philosofer, 
i i Rethoricorum, 
pat it is sorwe of suche good 
not for anoÞer 
h a p suche good 
but for he hap no such good. 
Panne elus is reducte to loue. 
And also gratia is reducte to loue, 
for by loue a man is gracious to anoÞer. 
For as Þe philosofer treteth of gratia, 
| and as it is of passion, 
col. gratia is nout elles 
but a sterynge of Þe soule 
by Þe whiche man 
is inclined and imeued 
to eue iftes 
and to do good to oÞere. 
Pan elus and gratia 
ben ibrout to loue. 
But verecundia, schamefastnesse, 
is reducte to drede; 
and a man may drede in twey manere wise: corrupcioun and vnworschip. 
A n d he pat dredeth corupcioun and bodyliche harm is timidus, ferfol, 
but he v I pat dredeth schame and velony is icleÞed verecundus. 
Panne verecundia is nougt elles 
but drede of schame 
oÞer of velonie. 
Þerfore ofte verecundia 
is cleÞed erubescencia, 
wexinge reed, 
for comonlich he pat is aschamed wexeÞ reed 
as he pat dredep wexeth paal. 
For if a man trowe 
pat he schal lose his lif, 
pat is inward good, 
banne he dredeth; 
but if he troweth to leese his worschip, 
Þeanne he is aschamed. 
For in drede Þe blood draweth inward 
and Þe membres ben pale withoute 
for drede cometh of trowyng pat a man schal luse inward good. 
But whan a man is aschamed, 
Þe blood draweth outward 
and Þe face semeth reed; 
and Þe blood renneth banne outward, 
for schame cometh of trowyng 
of lost of outward good. 
Panne is twey manere drede: 
on is drede of lost of inward good, 
and in pat drede a man wexeth pale; 
and Þe oÞer 
is drede of lost of honour 
and worschep pat is outward good, 
and in pat drede a man wexeth reed. 
Panne drede of corrupcioun 
and of lost of inward good, 
for it hath no speciale name, 
holdeth Þe comyne name 
and is icleped tymor. 
But drede of lost of honour and worschipe hath a special name 
and is icleped vere|cundia and erubescencia also. 
Panne verecundia, schame- f. fastinesse, 
is a manere drede 
and is reducte and ibrougt to drede. 
For it is iknowe how gelus, gelousie, and gratia 
ben reducted 
and ibrougt to loue 
and how verecundia 
is reducte to drede, 
it is to wetynge how inuidia (envie), 
and misericordia (mercy), 
and nemesis (pat is indignacioun) 
ben reducte to sorwe. 
Panne it is to wetyng pat Þes p r e ben special maners of sorwe for a man may be sory 
for anoÞeris harme oper good. 
For if he is sory 
for anoÞeris harme 
and troweth namlich 
pat he hath wrongfullich pat harme, 
pat is misericordia, rewÞe; 
for, ii Rethoricorum, 
it is iseid pat misericordia 
is not elles but a certein sorwe of harme 
pat is iseie and iknowe 
and corrumpeth a man 
and maketh hym sory 
pat hath pat harme with wrong. 
A n d if a man is sory 
not for harme of anoÞer man 
but for his good, 
pat may be in twey manere wise oÞer for his good in itself, 
and so it is inuidia. 
For as it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
inuidia is not elles but a certein sorwe for Þe‡ apparent occasiun of oÞere mennes good; 
pat is to say pei 
ar able to falle bytwene men of oo staat. 
A n d pat hath suche sorwe 
is not sory 
for he hath not pulke good, 
but he is sory 
pat anoÞer man hath pilke good. 
For inuidia, enuye, 
is not elles but sorwe 
for anoÞer mannes good, 
not for he himself hath not pat good 
but for an nother to wham he hath enuye 
pat hath pat good. 
A n d enuye is most bytwene peeres and men of oon estat as crockers hauen envie to crockers and smethes 
to smethes and so of opere manere men. 
But if a man is sory 
for anoÞer mannis good - 
and not in al maner wise but | col. 
for he is not worthi to haue pat good - 
and so he is nemesis, 
pat is indignacioun. 
For, ii Rethoricorum, 
pe philosofer seith pat nemesis, 
r indignation, 
is sorwe for his good and prospérité 
pat is not worthi to haue good and prosÞerite. 
Panne if alle Þese passions maken diuersite in oure workes and dedes, 
it is semelich pat we knowe hem alle. 
A n d Þe more excellent workes 
kynges and princes schude haue, 
Þe more semelich it is pat he knowe alle Þes passions. Chapter XI Summe of Þe forseide passions 
semen good as misericordia (rewÞe) 
[and] verecundia (schamefastnesse); 
for, 
as Þe philosofer seith, 
Þeis verecundia be not a vertue, 
gut it is a good passioun. 
So gratia and nemesis semen good passions. 
And somme of Þes passions 
ben to blamyng 
as envye and hate, 
for hate is to blame 
but it be 
for som vicious doynge; and oÞere passions 
may be both good and euel. 
Þerfore it is bisiliche 
to wetynge pat alwey in man[er]es 
and i n Þ e w e s pe mene is ipreysed 
and to moche and to luyte is iblamed. 
Panne Þe passions pat semen good of hemself 
ben mene 
as he pat is verecundus 
is mene bytwene hym pat is stupidus 
(pat is aschamed of al thing) 
and hym pat is inuerecundus. 
For he pat is aschamed of al pyng 
is icleped stupidus 
and he pat is aschamed of no thing 
is icleped inverecundus, 
and neiger o f f e s e is to preising. 
And he pat is mene 
and is aschamed 
as he scholde 
and not aschamed 
but as he scholde 
is cleped verecundus 
and is to preysyng. 
Also misericordia (mercie, rewthe) 
is mene 
bytwene cruelnesse and mollicies, neschenesse, 
for he pat hath reuthe of no thing | is cruel f. 
and he pat hath rewthe 
of al pyng 
is mollis (nesche) and wommanliche. 
And he pat hath rewÞe 
of hem pat hauen harme wrongfulliche 
is mene 
and is to preisyng 
and is icleped mysericors, merciable. 
And also nemesis is mene 
bytwene inuidia (envye) and placiditas, 
for he pat is envious is sory for al prosperite 
and he pat is placidus, plesant, 
and contrarie to hym 
pat is envious man hath ioye of al prosperite. 
And he pat is nemesius (pat is indignacioun of prosperite) is mene, 
for he hath ioye of prosperite ‡of good men 
and is sory for prosÞerite of euel men. 
And also gratia pat is ipreised is mene 
bytwene to moche and to lite for he pat is gracious to al men worthi 
and vnworthi is to blame, 
and he pat is gracious 
to no man is to blame. 
But he pat is gracious to hem pat ben worthi 
and not to hem pat ben not worthi is mene and is ipreysed. 
Panne goode passions 
b e p mene and euele passions passeth or lakketh in to moche oÞer t o lite. 
For al pat is to moche oÞer t o lite is to blame, 
for enuye passeth in to moche 
for perof cometh sorwe of al prosÞerite; 
and also [halte is to blame, 
for it passeth in to moche. 
A n d passions pat may be bothe good 
and euel ben to blame 
ifÞei holden to moche oÞer to lite and ben goode if Þey holden Þe mene. 
v I Now p i s is iknowe, 
it is to wetynge 
how kynges and princes schulde haue hemself in Þese passions. 
ForÞeischolde haue gratia, grace, and misericordia 
for Þei ben good passions, 
for it is semelich pat Þei be gracious and merciable. 
For nameliche Þei schulde dele 
and geue good and harme - good 
to good men 
and peyne to euel men. 
A n d benefice and reward ben panne rigtfiilliche ideled whanne | kynges and princes col. 
and Þei pat scholde dele suche rewardes to goode men 
‡and worthi ben gracious. 
And harme and peyne ben Þewliche ideled whanne alwey Þei [‡] 
ben imeued to mercie [ f o r h e m p a t s o f f r e n v n w o r t h i l i c h e ] . 
A n d verecundia and nemesis, 
pei he seme good passiouns, 
longib not to kingis and princis i n al wise, 
for it is not semelich 
to hem to be schamefast; 
for it is not semelich 
to hem to do werkis and dedis 
wherfor pei schulde be aschamid. 
It is yseide, iiii Ethicorum, 
pat w e preisin childrin pat be schamfast; 
and no man preisib Þe olde men 
if he is schamfast, 
[for] we gessin not pat hem nedip to do werkis and dedis 
where he schulde be aschamid. 
Also per it is iseid pat studius men schuld not be aschamid, 
for schame cumb of euil dedis 
and a stodius man schulde nogt do euil dedis. 
Wherfore if it is semelich pat kynges and princes scholde be olde in maneres, 
it is not semelich 
pat he be aschamed 
but if it be by supposicion and happe. 
For if it happeth hem to do foule dedes, 
he schulde be aschamed. 
And nemesis semeth not moche to preysyng noÞer is moche ipreised, 
for Þerby som man hath indignacioun 
to greet of prosperite of euel men. 
For euel men mow not haue Þe moste good, 
pat is vertuous; 
but o o n caas pei mowe haue mene good 
oper good 
pat is lest worthi, 
as outward good and good pat is lest worthi, 
it is not gretlich to chargyng 
to euel men 
to haue suche good so pat Þei haue not suche good 
by mysdoyng and wrong. 
For if a man scholde dele pis good and make iftes Þerof, 
he scholde not dele pat good to vnworthi men 
but to worthi men. 
Panne kynges and princes scholde so be nemeseci, 
hauyng indignacioun, 
and thei scholde be mansueti 
and haue indignacioun 
of prosperite of euel men 
so pat Þei dele not here good 
to hem pat ben vnworthi. 
Panne Þei schulde haue hemself 
in bis wise in passions pat | semen good. 
A n d Þey schulde voide 
and forsake enuye f. pat is an euel passioun; 
and also he schulde forsake hate 
but it were for som vicious doyng, 
for vices ben to hatynge and worthi to be distroied 
with myt and strengthe. 
In oÞere passions 
pat may be good and euel pei schulle haue hemself 
w e l if Þei haue 
Þe vertues of Þe 
whiche we made mencioun tofore. 
For by Þe vertue mansuetudo 
Þei mowe haue hemself 
wel in wrethe 
and in pe contrarie Þerof, 
for he is mansuetus 
pat is wrooth 
as he scholde and whanne he scholde 
and how he scholde. 
A n d by Þe vertue fortitudo 
Þei mow haue hemself 
wel in hardinesse and in drede; 
for he is fortis pat is hardi 
as he scholde and dredeth as he scholde. 
By r magnanimité and humilité 
pei schulde haue hemself 
wel in hope and in despeire. 
For magnanimite apateth despeire 
pat it schal nout withdrawe 
fro excellent and passyng good 
by cause of difficulte, hardnesse. 
And humilite, mekenesse, moderateth hope 
pat me scholde not take to grete Þeril to come to pat good 
by cause of goodnesse 
and likyng pat is gerinne. 
A n d by oÞer vertues pat ben 
in Þe concupiscible 
pey mo we haue hemself 
wel in passions of Þe concupiscible, coueitous, 
so pat Þei mowe loue as Þei scholde, 
and desire, 
and haue abhominacioun and delectacioun 
and be sori 
‡als he scholde, 
and haue hemself in alle Þese 
as ordre and reule and resoun axeth. 
Panne at p i s tyme be p i s inow of passions; 
forifout failleth here, 
it schal be declared innermore [more] diffuselich. 
For in Þe pridde book 
we schal trete of drede, 
of loue, 
and of misericordia, 
and of oÞere as Þe mater axeth. 
For Þere we schal declare how kynges and princes schal bere hemself 
to be drad of Þe | puple 
and how to haue loue of Þe col. puple and how he schal be merciable 
and how he schal be gelous. 
For moche pat heere is treted generallich schal be pare declared particularliche. 
Touchinge Þe passions of Þe concupiscible, 
pat Þei mowe loue and desire 
and haue abhominacioun 
and be sory 
as Þei scholde and do 
in alle Þese 
as ordre and reule of resoun axeth of passions, 
be p i s inow 
at p i s tyme. Part IV 
Whiche maners of children ben good 
and how kynges and princes schulde haue hem Þerinne. 
Whiche maners of children ben euel and how kynges and princes schulde haue hem to suche maners. 
Whiche maners of olde men ben iuel 
and how kynges and princes schulde forsake suche maners. 
Whiche maners of olde men ben good 
and whiche ben Þe maners of men of mene age 
and how kynges and princes schulde haue hem in suche maners. 
Whiche ben Þe maners of noble men 
and how kynges and princes scholde haue hemself to suche maners. 
Whiche ben Þe maners of riche men 
and how kynges and princes scholde haue hemself to suche maners. 
Whiche ben Þe maneres of myti men and how kynges and princes schulde haue hemself 
to suche maners. Chapter I 
For p r e parties ben isÞed of p i s firste 
n Þe whiche it is declared 
wherinne kynges and princes schulde sette here ende 
and with what vertues 
Þey schulde be higt 
and what passions 
Þei scholde folwe and forsake, 
it is to declarynge 
in Þe ferÞe partie what maneres and Þewes 
Þei scholde folwe and haue. 
A n d maners mowe be diuerse 
in tweye maner wise, 
by age and by fortune. 
| B i age, 
for childrin and olde men and men of mene age hauin f. diuers maneris. 
A n d ‡fortune maki] diuers[i]te in maneris, 
for Þe good of fortune 
pat is outward good 
(as nobilnesse and gentillesse and myt v and richesse) 
makep gret diuersitee ‡in maners and in pewes. 
For comonliche noble men hauen oÞere maners 
p a n Þei pat ben nat noble and gentil, 
and myte men hauen oÞere maners 
p a n vnmyti, 
and riche men oÞere maners 
p a n pore men. 
Of al Þese maneres we schul sÞeke. 
But firste we schul speke 
of maners of children; 
of here maners summe ben good 
and sum ben euel. 
Also, ii Rethoricorum, 
Þe philosofer toucheth oper thinges of children and speketh of sex maners 
pat ben good and of sexe pat ben euel. 
A n d first, 
here manere is good for Þei ben liberal and fre herted. 
Þe seconde, 
for pei ben bolde 
and of good hoÞe. 
Þe Jsridde, 
for Þei ben magnanimi. 
Þe ferÞe, 
forÞeiben not malicious. 
Þe fifte, 
for Þei w 
o l sone haue mercye 
and foreue trespas. 
Þe sexte and Þe laste, 
for Þei ben schamefast. 
And children ben liberal 
forÞei ben not expert noÞer hauen assayed nede and defaute noÞer hauen igete Þe good pat Þei hauen with here owne trauaille. 
For ech man kepeth his owne good 
pe more besiliche 
whan he h a p heed harme for ‡ nede 
and for defaute oÞer 
if he hath gete good and catel 
w i p his sleite and trauaille. 
For what is igete with trauaille 
is IÞe more besiliche ikept and iholde, 
in so moche pat eche man hath likyng 
in his workes and dedes, 
so pat he loueth Þe bettre al pat he geteth 
with his owne sleithe and traueille. 
Þe secounde, children ben of good hope 
and pat is for p r e skiles as Þe philosofer preueth, 
[ii] Rethoricorum. 
For children ben bolde and of grete | hope first, 
for Þei hauen assaied 
but lite nopcer hauen ofte col. 
ifailled of here purpos, 
Þerfore pei wenen to do alle thinges. 
A n d ben also of good hope 
for Þei hauen moche blood 
in Þe herte 
and in oÞere membris pat taken grete heete of Þe blood 
pat is in children. 
A n d so Þerfore Þei ben of good hope 
and boold and hardy to do al thinges. 
Also children hauen liued 
but a litel while and schal lyue longe afterward 
by comune cours of kynde. 
Panne for mynde is of thing pat is ago and hope of thing 
pat is to comyng, 
children hauen litel mynde and grete hoÞe. 
For children hauen not greet likyng in dedes pat Þei hauen ido, 
for Þei hauen no mynde 
but of fewe dedes 
pat Þei hauen ido and lyte; 
but Þei hauen greet likynge 
in thenkynge of thinges 
pat ben to comynge, 
for Þei hoÞen to do grete dedes. 
Wherfore Þei ben bolde and of grete hoÞe. 
Þe Þridde, children ben magnanimi 
and Þe cause Þeroi is asigned by thinges pat ben iseid. 
For fcerby a man is magnanimus 
for he makeÞ him worthi to greet doynge 
and putteth hymself 
i o r p to grete dedes. 
Pan [for] children ben liberal, 
and for pei ben bolde 
and of good hoÞe, 
Þei hauen not what hem schulde withdrawe nopser lette w h i Þei scholde nat be magnanimi. 
A n d herto may a sÞecial resoun be assigned. 
For children ben passyng hote 
and it longep to pyng pat 
is hot to be aboue. Alwey children wolde be aboue, 
so we seen in Þe ordre of Þe elementes pat alway 
Þe hote elementes 
as fuyre and ayer ben alwey PartIV aboue Þe colde elementis 
pat ben erÞe and water. 
Panne for among oÞer thinges 
by Þe whiche a man semeth hige and excellent, 
children desiren most honour 
and worschep 
and ben by Þe consequent folwynge 
in sum wise magnanimi. 
A n d IÞe proper mater | of magnanimus f. semeb worschep. 
Þe ferÞe, 
children ben to preysyng, 
for Þei ben not malicious for Þei t r o w e n pat al men ben gode. 
A n d Þe cause is for Þei trowen and knowen not 
Þe dedes of men 
by thinges pat Þei hauen isey; 
but by Þing pat Þei knowen in hemself, 
so Þei trowen 
pat it is in oÞer men. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
pat by here owne innoc[e]nse Þei demen of oÞere; 
and so for Þei ben innocentes, 
Þei wenen pat oÞere ben innocentes. 
Þe fifte, 
children w o l sone haue mercye and forgeue; 
for, 
as it is iseid tofore, 
if we trowen pat men hauen harme with wrong, 
mercie comeb principallich Þerof. 
Wherfore if children by here innocence demeÞ of oÞere and troweb 
pat pei hauen harme with wrong, 
pei ben sone imeued to mercy. 
I line Þe sexte, 
children ben schamfast for pei desiren to moche worschep. oi. , 
For, 
as it is ised tofore, 
schamefastnesse is drede of lost of worschep. 
Pan for children ben passyng hoot and desiren gretlich to be excellent and dreden lost of worschep, 
wherfore in pat wise 
Þei wexen sone aschamed. 
But Þe philosofer, 
[ii Rethorlicorum, 
toucheb anoÞer cause 
w h i children ben kindelich schamefast. 
For, 
as he seith, 
he knoweb not 
but what Þei ben taugt by lawe; 
and Þei clepen laweful lore 
hestes of fader and moder 
by Þe whiche children ben itaugt. 
Pan for modres techen here children 
to do honest dedes 
and for honeste is pe Staat of worschep, 
children desiren many thinges 
pat worschip stondeb inne. 
A n d by Þe contrarie pei dreden moche thinges 
by Þe whiche Þei scholde be aschamed 
and lese worschep. 
A n d for schamefulnesse 
is drede of lost of worschip, 
children ben | sone aschamed. 
f. 
It is iknowe what maners ben good in children, 
and it may be sone iknowe how kynges and princes schulde haue hemself 
to suche maneres. 
For not al pyng pat is to preysyng 
is symplelich to preysyng in al pyng, 
for we seen pat schrewednesse and angre 
is to preysyng in an hound 
but not in a man. 
So pei schamefastnesse be to preysyng in children, 
for by cause of age pei mowe not kepe hemself 
but if pei doun foule dedes 
of be whiche he scholde be aschamed. 
But kynges and princes, 
pat schulde [ben] 
as it were half goddis, 
schold not onlich haue abhominacion 
to foule dedes 
but also to hure speke of foule dedes; 
for schrewed talkyng corompeth and destroyeb good maneres and bewes. 
Pan pei ben not in be staat 
in be whiche pei scholde be aschamed. 
Pan it is not semelich to hem to ben aschamed, 
but by supposicioun. 
if it happeb to hem 
to do foule dedes, 
he schulde be aschamed more pan r C l i n e v oÞere men; 
for he dop more vnsemelich p a n o p e r men 
for he dop more p a n oper men. 
Pan Þe first fife 
pat we seide ben to preysyng in children we may applie to kynges and princes, 
for Þei scholde be liberal, 
of good hoÞe, 
not malicious, magnanimi, and merciable. 
And Þe sixte, 
to be schamfast, 
is not sympliche semeliche 
to kynges and princes. 
For kynges and princes scholde be liberal, 
for Þei dede agenst kynde 
if Þei multeplied 
Þe grete richesse 
pat Þei hauen 
and sÞende it not in liberalitate. 
And Þe more worjy Þe commune nedes ben passyng 
o Þ e r nedes, 
pe more semelich it is pat kynges and princes scholde be of good hoÞe 
p a n oÞer men. 
Also Þei scholde be magnanimi, 
for it is iseid in a chapitre, de magnanimitate, 
pat [mlagnanimitas longep most to kynges 
and to princes for it is most semelich pat Þei doun passing grete dedes. 
Also Þei schulde not be malicious 
so pat Þei schulde haue not [of] al men euel susÞecioun neiÞer alwey mystake Þe dedes of here sogettes, 
for so Þei mygt be tyrantes 
and destroye Þe Þeple. 
Also Þei schulde be merciable 
for as Þe philosofer seith, Rethoricorum, 
comonlich men doun euel and |Þerforebrotelnes 
[of mankynde axeth f. , 
forifte] of synnes and of trespas. 
Wherfore kynges and princes pat geuen Þe lawe schulde be merciable 
and not schamfast symplich, 
as it is iseid tofore. 
v c o Chapter II 
As we rekened tofore sex good maneres of children, 
so we may rekene of hem sex euel maneres 
Þe whiche Þe philosofer touchen, 
ii [Rethor]icorum: first, 
for children folwen passions; 
Þe seconde, 
for Þei ben vnstedefast and vnstable; 
Þe iii, 
for Þei trowen tales to sone; 
Þe , for Þei chiden and striven; 
Þe hfÞe, 
for Þei ben liers and fonden 
in som wise to 
mey[n]tene al pat he tellejp; 
Þe sixte, 
in here doynge Þei hauen no mesure butfceidon al pat Þei doun passyng mesure. 
Andfirst,children folwen passions, 
and namlich likyng of body, 
and ben incontinent 
and folwen lechery 
and pat is for ii causes. 
For by cause pat children 
ben passyng hote and apÞetite of lecherie comej) 
of hete of Þe body, 
Þerfore kynde disposicion of Þe body 
excitep children 
to lykyng of lecherye. 
For as it were in al oure dedes we folwen passiouns 
oÞer resoun, 
and Þe lasse maistrie reson 
h a Þ in vs, 
Þe more maistrye passions hauen in vs, 
p a n for children ben not expert noÞer hauen gret vnderstondyng and prudencia and ben more ilad by passions 
p a n by reson, 
wherfore comynlich he folwefc passions. 
Þe ii, Þei ben vnstable and vnstedefast, 
for Þe soule folweÞ com plexions of Þe body. 
Pan as in bodies of children humores ben in gret meuyng, 
so Þei hauen suype vnstabil likynge and wil. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
Part I V ii Rethoricorum, 
pat children hauen strong appetite 
and hauen sone inoug and desiren strongliche and changen anon. 
Þe , pei trowen tales to sone; 
and as it longeb to bis 
doyng,patmay be for twey causes. First, 
for pei ben not malicious noÞer trowen pat oÞere men ben euel 
but by here innocentry 
Þei demen oÞere men, 
ban for it is kyndelich pat a man trowe sone hym pat he holdeb good 
and troweth not pat 
Þei speken of malice, children, 
in trowyng pat al men ben innocent, 
trowen al men sone. 
Also pis may be for children 
ben not exÞert; 
for Þei pat ben not taugt 
by manie wordes 
and hiren many wordes 
of hem 
pat ben itaugt, 
Þei taken hede of fewe binges 
and demen sone. 
Þerfore it is iseid 
in a prouerbe pat he pat knoweb lite demeb sone. Pan children, 
for Þei ben non expert of many thinges, 
anon as eny nede is pursewed to hem, 
Þei mowe non take hede of many thinges and demeb 
Þerfore anon of pat nede and troweb 
as it is ‡ itold to hem. 
And if Þei knowe in any thinges and nedes, 
and if Þei kun take consideracione of condiciouns of men, 
Þei wolde not anon assent 
and trowe al pyng pat is told to hem bot 
Þei wolde bysilich avise hem 
wheÞer it were to trowe oÞer no. 
Þe ferÞe, children chiden and striuen. 
For as it is iseid tofore, children desire most | [to be] excellent. 
Þerfore if Þei seen oÞere more f. excellent ban Þei ben, 
Þei chiden and striuen anoon. 
Þe fifte, 
children ben liers and fonden in som wise 
to meynteyne al pat he telleth, 
for Þei ben not expert 
noÞer knowen hemself. 
And nathales he weneth 
pat he knowe al byng 
and answereth 
Þerfore to alle thinges; 
and he wolde be holde kunnyng 
and wol pat men wene pat 
Þey kun sckele in al thing, 
and Þei affermen al thing 
for to be holde konnynge. 
And for Þei affermen thinges pat Þei knowen <nogÞ, 
Þei lien ofte tymes. 
And whanne Þei lien falsliche, 
git Þei desiren worschip 
and fonden to meynteyne 
Þey[re] lesyng and wenen pat Þei ben in worschip by Þe lesyng Þeig it seme it be not as Þei teilen, 
line Þe vi, 
Þei han no 
m[esur]e in here dedes but Þei doun 
al here dedes f. , 
passyng mesure and manere. 
ii Rethoricorum, 
it is iseid pat Þei louen , 
passyng mesure and haten passyng mesure, 
and so Þei doun 
in loue and hate and doun here 
dedes passyng mesure and maner. 
And pat is for Þei [ben] of scharp wreÞe and hab strong delectacioun and likyng, 
for wrab and delectacioun ben strong 
but he be abated by resoun. 
Pan for children leuen more and ben ilad 
by passioun ban by resoun, 
here delectacioun is not moderat 
but Þei doun 
al here dedes passyng mesure and ouerdon. 
For it is knowe 
which ben Þe euel maneres of children, 
it may be son iknowe how kynges and princes scholde haue hemself 
in swiche maneres. 
For if swiche maneres 
ben to blame in children, 
moche more Þei ben to blame in olde men 
and ben most to blamyng in kynges and princes pat schulde be heed and rewle of oÞer. 
And it is r r c o l i n e vnsemelich patfceifolwe passions 
andfcatÞeihaue strong apÞetite and delectacioun in lecherye, 
for in hem schulde be most wit 
and vnderstondyng 
and Þei pat doun 
so leuen not by resoun 
but by passioun. 
Also it is fule and detestabile 
for hem to be vnstedefast and vnstable. 
For [if] it is inconuenient 
if Þe rewele ys croked, 
| and kynges and f. ; 
princis scholde be ensample of leuyng 
and rewle of oÞere men, 
pan it col. is inconuenient if Þei ben sone Þeruerte and vnstable, 
for Þei schuld be stedefast and stable. 
Þe fcridde, 
Þei ne scholde trowe euel tales 
to sone for Þei hauen many flaterers 
and many bak biters 
pat sÞeken in here geres. 
Þerfore Þei scholde wip greet besynesseÞenk and deuyse hem what maner men pai ben pat sÞeken - wheÞev 
Þei ben wyse men or vnwise, vertuous or vicious; 
for wise men and good schulde be more itrowed 
p a n vnwise and euel. 
Þe ferÞe, 
Þei scholde not do wrong noÞer despite; 
for Þei scholde do ponysching 
and not wrong noÞer despit nofcer wikkednesse 
but for rigt 
and for Þe comyn profit. 
Þe V, 
and namelich kynges and princes 
and generallich al lordes schulde voide and forsake lesynges 
lest Þei m a k e hemself worthi to be spysed. 
For if lesynges makeÞ men worthi to be spised, 
wip Þe more cautel and besynesse 
Þey schulde Studie to knowe Þe soÞe 
and holde Þerwip. 
line Þe sexte, 
Þei [scholde] hauen ‡mesour in here dedes; 
for by cause f. pat oÞer thinges 
ben moderate by mesure, 
it is most nede pat rewle and . mesure be moderate. 
Pan kynges pat schulde be rewle and mesure of oÞer men 
scholde principalliche be moderat. 
c o l c o l m e Chapter III 
For maners of children ben irekened 
and it is declared how kynges and princes schulde haue hemself to suche maners, 
it is to wetyng whiche ben 
Þe maners of olde men 
and how kynges and princes scholde haue hemself 
to suche maners. 
And som maners of olde men ben good and som euele. 
And Þe philosofer, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
among oÞere maners of olde men 
jsat he toucheth and rekeneth he toucheth sex euel maners. 
Forfirst,olde men ben to ouertrowos - <surquydous>

Þe ferÞe,

Þe

Þe sexte, 
Þei ben not schamefast 
but Þei ben lest aschamed. 
First, olde men ben hard of bylyue, 
and pat cometh of assay; 
for pei ben exÞert and hauen assaied many thynges and knowen pat men lien ofte, 
and ben Þerfore hard of bylyue and trowen 
pat al oÞere men ben gylours. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
[ii Rethor]icorum, 
pat olde men hauen ileued Part W many a eer 
and ofte ben desceyued and bygiled. 
Panne for p i s exÞeriens and assay, 
Þei ben hard of byleue. 
Þe seconde, olde men ben suspecious; 
and comynlyche al pat he s e e p h e hath susÞecioun 
pat it is euel 
and taketh it of Þe worse side. 
It semeth pat olde men 
ben contrarie

for children hauen not ido manye euel dedes; 
but Þei ben innocent and demen by here 
awne innocence 
ojsere men and taken alle dedes

But olde men doun Þe contrarie, 
for Þei hauen ileued longe tyme 
and hauen ofte ido euel dedes 
and demen dedes of [odere] men by here owne euel dedes. 
Þerfore comounliche Þei trowen 
pat oÞere men ben euel 
and taken here dedes to Þe worse side. 
Þerfore it is iseide, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
pat for olde men hauen ileued longe tyme, 
it may not be but Þei haue don many euel dedis 
and ben Þerfore euel of susÞexioun 
and gessen al thing to Þe worse side. 
Þe pridde, olde men ben pusillanymes and ferful; 
and ben pusillanymes for Þey ben ibrout lowe | 
in Þe lif; 
for by cause of longe leuynge, 
f. Þei ben brout lowe and faylen. 
Panne as in hem faillen humours and lif, 
so in hem faillen Þe herte of confort 
and ben Þerfore pusillanimes and ferful. 
And for as it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
coold arayeth lif to ferfulnesse; 
for Þe philosofre seith pat 
eche man [pat] is kyndeliche disposed 
as he is disposed 
in sum passioun 
is kyndelich passionate 
by pat passioun; 
panne for ferfol men ben cold, 
eche man pat is kyndelich cold 
it semep and schewejs pat he is kyndelich ferful. 
Panne it schewiÞ pat cold men ben kyndelich ferful 
for in hem kindelich hete failen 
and in here membris 
is kyndeliche colde. 
Þe ferpe, 
Þei ben illiberal and chinches 
and pat is for pre causes: first, 
for defaute of lif; 
Þe seconde, 
for experience of tyme; 
and Þe Þridde, 
for Þei leuen not in hoÞe but in mynde. 
For comonliche Þe sowie folweth complexions of Þe body e. 
Panne as olde men 
in here owne bodye faillen in humours and in lif, 
so Þei dreden pat al here good faillen. 
Pan Þey drede to suffre defaute and lacke, and dar not sÞende, 
and ben illiberal and chinches. 
And for Þei seen pat Þei hemself faillen 
and Þei tristen not in here owne strengpe and myt 
but oonlych in here good and cataille, banne, 
for al here trist is on hire good and catel, 
pai dar not spende. 
Also Þei ben illiberal and chynches 
for experience of tyme, 
for it may wel be pat 
in here longe lif tyme Þei hauen ofte ihadde lacke and defaute, 
and dreden Þerfore lacke and defaute 
and ben illiberal and chinches. 
Also Þei ben illiberal and chinches 
for Þei | lyuen more in mynde panne in hoÞe, 
for Þey thenken col. pat Þei hauen longe ileued and pat Þei schal lyue but a while. 
And for mynde is of thing 
pat is apassed and hope of thing 
pat is t o comyng, 
Þei lyuen not in hope 
but trusteth in good pat Þei hauen 
<and irestep not in gode pat 
pei schul gete here after>, 
but lyuep in mynde 
and in v T h e G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d Princes trist of god pat tÞei haue ygete, 
and trist nat in gode pat Þei scholde gete here aftir, 
and ben Þerfor illiberal and chinches 
and euep not gladlych awey pat Þei hauen igete. 
Þe fifte, 
pei ben of euel hope 
and haue non gode hope 
and trist on bynges for Þei trowen pat Þey hemself 
and al thing schal faille pat hem nedeth. 
On case herof is assigned tofore. 
For if hope is of thing pat is to comynge, 
and mynde of thing pat is apassed, 
and olde men hauen ileued longe tyme and schal lyue 
but a while, 
and pat pei knowen, a ‡ faile in hoÞe 
and hauen in pouzt pat Þei schul not do 
manye grete dedes, 
and leue not, 
nother haueth likyng in hoÞe 
but in mynde. 
And a signe herof 
is for eche man 
treteth gladliche of thinges 
in Þe whiche he hath likyng. 
And we seen whan olde men 
ben gadred togeders, 
alwey Þei talken of dedes 
pat Þei hauen ido 
and hauen no likynge 
to talke of dedes 
pat Þei schal do. 
For Þey seen and knowen pat Þei schal do 
but fewe dedes, 
and ben Þerfore of hard hope; 
for pei faile in hope and hopen not to do many dedis. 
Þe vi, olde men ben schameles. 
For olde men ben illiberal and chinches and Chargen thing 
pat is more profitable 
p a n of thing pat is honest and Studien of thing 
pat is more profit and grete pan to gete Þe state of worschep, 
as Þe philoso|fer meneth, 
ii Rethoricorum. 
Panne for f. schamefastnesse 
is drede of lost of worschip, 
it longeth not to olde men 
for Þey louen profit more pan worschiÞe. 
For p e hoole cause whi a man is schamefast 
it is for he wolde be moche itolde of and haue worscheÞe 
as Þe philosofre meneth. 
And as olde men faulen in lif, 
in myte and in strengthe, 
in humours, 
and in kynde hete, 
so Þei faillen in herte 
and in confort and reccheth 
not to be moche itolde of. 
And oo cause myt be assigned 
pat 
is som del comyne 
to al pat is iseid. 
For it is iseid 
pat olde men ben colde, 
and coold wasteth and constreyneth 
and in constreynyng it maketh hem 
Þe more heuy and desire to lower place. 
And we seen pat Þe elementes 
pat ben colde and heuy ben bynethe and hote elementes 
and ligt ben aboue. 
Panne olde men pat ben colde ben iprest togedres in hemself 
by cold and ben as it were inmeuable so 
pat Þey dar not do, 
nofcer trowe, 
noÞer hope so 
pat Þei recche not 
to be excellent noper 
to be moche itolde of, 
for colde thinges hauen appetite 
to be bynethe and not aboue. 
For it is iknowe whiche ben Þe euel maners of olde men, 
it may be sone iknowe [how] kynges 
and princes schulde haue hemself 
to suche maners. 
For it is iknowe pat kynges and princes scholde not in al thinges trowen tales 
to sone as children doun, 
gut pey scholde not be susÞecious noÞer take al dedes 
to Þe worse side; 
for panne Þei were cruel and vnmerciable 
and ihated of here sogettes. 
Þe pridde, 
Þey scholde not be ferfol and pusillanymes, 
‡ mode‡les, | col. 
but he scholde be fortes, strong, and magnanimi. 
For Þe nedes pat toucheth al Þe regne 
(in Þe whiche nedes kynges and princes schulde r Part I V be occupied) 
ben grete and difficulte, 
it nedeth pat kynges and princes be fortes, strong, and magnanimi, grete. 
Þe ferÞe, it is detestable if Þey ben illiberal and chinches, 
for it is iseid tofore and declared atte pe folle 
in pe tretys of vertues pat kynges and princes scholde not oonlich be liberal, fortes, and moderat 
but also Þei scholde be magnifici, 
swiÞe noble and gret, 
and do grete dedes and workes. 
Þe fifte, 
pey scholde be of goode hoÞe; 
for if Þey trowen to faille in al thing, 
he wol assay no thing 
and panne he putteth Þe regne in Þeril. 
Þe sixte, 
Þey scholde not be vnschamefast 
in pat manere 
as olde men ben and setten not by Þe Staat of worschip 
and ben more occupied in profitable dedes 
p a n in worschepful dedes. 
Nathalees, 
Þey scholde not be aschamed for Þey scholde not do foule dedes 
of Þe whiche cometh schame and velanye. Chapter IV 
For Þe euel maners of olde men ben irekened, 
now here good maners schal be rekened. 
And it semeth pat Þe philosofre, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
setteth foure maners of olde men 
pat may be preysed: 
first, 
for olde men hauen delectacioun (delit), remissioun (forifte) and temporate; 
Þe seconde, 
Þey ben merciable; 
Þe fcridde, 
Þei affermen non bynges pat Þei ben inne dowt of; Þe firth, 
Þey do no dedis passyng mesure. 
For delectacioun and likyng of olde men - 
and namelich touchinge lechery 
(pat is lux[u]ria in Latyn) - 
is moo|derate and temporat for, 
as it f. iseid tofore, 
whan Þe body is hoot, 
likynge in lecherie is strong. 
Panne by pe contrarie, 
whanne pe body is cold, 
likynge in lecherie abateÞ. 
For he pat desireth lecherie spendeth by apÞetite 
and streccheth in to oÞere 
and pat is aenst Þe resoun of cold. 
For cold, 
in pat it is cold, 
streccheth not in itself 
proÞerlichenoter sÞende 
but constreyneth and schrynketh in itsilf. Panne by cause of colde, 
olde men schrynken in hemself 
and hauen moderat delectacioun and likyng; 
and herby it may be knowe 
how olde men ben illiberal and chinches. 
For by chincherie a man may do amys 
in twey maner wise: first, 
if he holdeth his owne 
oÞer wise garnie resoun wolde. 
Þe seconde, 
if he desireth oÞer wise 
pan resoun wolde 
to haue good pat he hath not. 
Olde men trespasseth more 
by chincherie 
in holdyng here owne good Jeanne 
in desiryng vntheweliche good pat 
Þey hauen not, 
for by cold thei schrynken more in hemself 
p a n streccheth hemself to oÞere. 
And for Þe soule 
in al his worching vsen in som wise a bodiliche lyme and instrument - 
as in woork of craft 
if Þe instrument is ichaunged, 
Þe worching chaungeth - 
so in worching of Þe soule, 
if Þe body chaungeth, 
Þe soule folewyth 
Þe complexioun of Þe body 
and his v worchinge chaungeth. 
Panne if Þe body is cold by apÞetite, 
IÞe soule is inclined 
to folwe Þe kynde of coold; 
and for coold is constreyned 
and ischronke in itself, 
Þerfore olde men 
by cause of cold hauen slak delectacioun and likynge as Þe philosofre wol mene, ii Rethoricorum. 
Þe secunde, 
oolde men ben merciable; 
but as Þe philosofer | seith, 
col. olde men and children 
be not merciable for Þe same cause. 
For children ben merciable for frendschip 
and olde men for feblenesse, 
for eche man is merciable 
to his frend 
and hath reuthe of hym pat 
Þey wenen pat hath harm with wrong. 
Panne for children louen frendschipe 
and demen by here innocence oÞer men, 
and troweth pat al men ben goode, 
wherfore whan men hauen harm, 
Þey wenen pat it is with wrong and hauen Þerfore sone mercye and reuÞe of hem. 
But olde men ben not merciable in p i s wise, 
for he troweth pat oÞere men ben good noÞer 
for loue of frendschipe, 
but for eche man 
pat is feble and failed desiren pat oÞer men 
schulde haue mercye 
and rewÞe of hym, 
and Þerfore he is inclined 
to haue mercye 
and reuthe of oÞere men. 
And so oolde men, 
for Þei ben feble and wolde pat oÞere men 
scholde haue mercy 
and rewÞe of hem, 
Þei hauen sone mercie 
and reuthe of oÞere men. 
Þe pridde, 
no thing pat is in doute 
Þei affermen certeynliche. For as Þe philosofre seith, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
for olde men hauen ileued longe tyme and iseye moche 
and ofte hauen be bygeled, 
Þey dar not afferme here sawes and menyng certeynliche 
for Þey dreden it be not so 
and pat Þey b 
e desceyued 
in manye manere wise. 
Þerfore, ii Rethoricorum, 
pe philosofre seith 
pat olde men euen dom of al thing with doute 
and settep alwey 
as it were a condicioun 
and seith no thing 
certeynliche noÞer stabilliche. 
For whanne me axeth of hem eny thing, 
Þey seyen on caas it is so, 
oper it may wel be. 
And so in som wise Þey dreden to be disceyued and euen non answere certeyneliche and stedefastliche. 
Þe ferjpe, 
pey doun no dedes passynge mesure 
but in alle here workes and dedes 
|Þeysemen temporate. 
For as children, 
pat hauen to moche f. blood and passyng delectacions and passions 
in al doyng, passeth and ouerdop, 
so oolde men, 
for here passions and delectacions ben moderate, 
comounliche Þey doun alle dedes moderatliche. 
For it is iknowe whiche ben Þe maners 
of yong men and of oolde men, 
it may be sone iknowe 
whiche ben Þe maners of men 
of mene age bytwene children and olde men. 
As Þe philosofer m e n e p , 
ii Rethoricorum, 
Þey hauen al pat 
is to preysyng in children 
and in olde men, 
for Þei ben not passyng hote as children 
noper passyng coolde as olde men, 
noper passyng bolde and hardy as children 
noÞer ferful and cowardes as olde men, 
but Þey ben mene bytwene bothe; 
for he dredeth Þere it is to dredyng 
and ben hardy 
Þer Þey scholde be hardy. 
So, 
for pei ben not alle inexpert as children, 
noÞer so ofte disceyued as olde men, 
noper trowen al men as children doun for defaute of r Part I 
V experience and of assaye, 
noÞer ben in al wise 
so hard of beleue as oolde men 
pat ben ofte desceyued, 
but Þey ben in mene, Þerfore, ii Rethoricorum, 
it is iseid pat men of mene age trowen not al men 
nother ben hard of byleue to al men 
but Þey demen by sothnesse and trouÞe. 
Also, 
for Þei ben mene 
bytwene children and olde men, 
Þei ben not intemporat as children 
nofcer ferfol and feble as olde men; 
but, 
as it is iseid, ii Rethoricorum, 
Þei ben strong with temporancia and temporate with strengte. 
Panne schortliche for to sÞeke, 
al pat is to preisyng in children 
oÞer in olde men is ifounde in men of mene age, 
and no thing pat is to blamyng in children 
oÞer in olde men is | ifounde in men of mene age. col. 
For as it is iseid tofore pat alwey to moche 
and to lyte is to blamynge, 
banne if in olde men 
oÞer in children out is to preisyng, 
pat is for he goth not to fer fro Þe mene; 
and if out in hem is to blamyng, 
pat is for Þey ben fer fro Þe mene and dob to moche oÞer to luyte. 
Wherfore if eny mene is in children 
oÞer in olde men, 
it is more parfit in men of mene age 
for┌al┐┌pat┐is to preysyng in hem 
is holliche ifounde in men of mene age. 
Also no thing pat is in hem to moche oÞer to lyte 
is ifounde in hem 
pat hath of mene age. 
And no thing pat is to blamyng in hem 
is ifounde in men of mene age. 
And in p i s wise 
it is to sÞekyng of maners of men. 
But suche wordes schal not alwey be ‡vnderstonde 
as necessarie and nedeful menyng pat olde men myte not be liberal and magnan­ imy and pat children myte not be temporat and stedefast, 
but he schal be vnderstonde 
by a manere disposicioun and inclinacioun; 
for by cours and ordre of kynde we seen that children and olde men and men of mene age 
hauen disposicioun and inclinacioun 
to maners acordynge to here age 
as it is declared tofore. 
For it is iknowe, 
it may be sone iknowe 
how kynges and princes scholde haue hemself 
to suche maners and bewes. 
For Þei scholde haue Þe good. For kynges and princes scholde lyue more by resoun 
p a n b y passioun, 
here lust and likynge schulde be temporate. 
For it is iseid tofore 
pat strong lust and likynge smyteth and blyndefc resoun. 
And Þey schulde be merciable, 
not for defaute noÞer for feblenesse 
but for good and | profite of Þe regne 
pat Þey may be loued of hem 
pat f. ben in Þe regne. 
For al Þe regne 
is imeued to louye 
Þe kyng if Þey seen hym mylde and merciable. 
Þe pridde, kynges and princes scholde not afferme and meyntene Þe oon partie of byng pat is in doute 
ne desire to be holde wyse and redye. 
Þe ferpe, 
they scholde be moderat 
and temÞerate 
in here workes and dedes; 
for, 
as it is iseid, 
Þei scholde be ensample of leuyng and rewle of oÞere men. 
v io T h e G o v e r 
n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s Panne sum maners 
of children 
and of olde men 
schal be chose 
and summe forsake; 
but of hem pat ben of mene age al maners ben in sum wyse to presyng. 
And we seyen in sum wise for thei children 
and olde men haue a manere inclinacioun 
to euel maners and Jsewes, 
ut Þey may do ayenst pat inclynacioun 
and fol we good maners and pewes. 
So men of mene age may haue inclinacioun and appetite corrupte 
and folwe euele maners and Þewes. 
Wherfore if me scholde haue lordschipe 
by resoun and vnderstondyng, 
kynges and princes pat ben lordes of oÞere men 
scholde folwe good maners and Þewes 
by dom and ordre of resoun. Chapter V 
As it longeth to p i s doynge, 
we may rekene foure good maners 
of ientel men and noble. 
For first, Þei ben magnanimi; 
Þe seconde, magnifici, noble; 
Þe pridde, 
Þey lernen and [ben] sley; 
Þe fevÞe, 
Þei ben politik (wis) 
and gode to speke with. 
Ientel men and noble ben magnanimi 
for as p e philosofer 
m e n e p , primo et ii Rethoricorum, 
ientilesse and noblesse 
is a vertue of ientil blode. 
And som ben cleped nobil and gentil for Þei ben icome of gentil blod 
and worschepful as Þe ‡ | philosofer meneth, 
ii Rethoricorum. col. 
And pat blood 
is cleped worschepful blood [i]f many worthi men 
and worschepful come of pat blood in oolde tyme. 
Panne Þe vertue of ientel blood 
pat Þe philosofre clepeth noblenesse 
is not elles but be icome of sum kynde 
oÞer blood in Þe whiche kynde and blood were manye princes 
and manye grete men 
and worthi 
in olde tyme 
and duryng fram olde tyme. 
Panne so it is to wetynge of ientilesse and noblenesse. 
And for by comyn composicioun of men 
al monye and richesse semeth 
Þe prise of eche thing 
(for by cause pat som men ben riche, 
Þey ben iholde worthi to be princes and ben Þerfore 
iholde solempne men and worthi honour and worschiÞe), Jeanne for by comun menynge of men, 
ientelnesse and noblenesse 
is not elles 
but oolde blood igrounded in richesse. 
Panne for noble men 
of olde tyme were souereynes and manye of here 
kyn and blood were solempne men and riche, 
Þerfore by ensample of Þe forfadres 
Þe ientelere 
a noble mannys herte is arered, 
a ‡ fondeth to do grete dedes 
and to be in gret worschep. 
For it is kyndeliche 
pat Þe effecte be ileche to Þe cause; 
pat is to menyng pat Þe makynge be ileche to Þe maker. 
Panne for Þe children 
ben Þe effecte of Þe fadres and modres, 
it is kyndeliche pat children 
folwe fadres and modres. 
Wherfore gentil men and noble, 
knowynge pat of here kynne and blood were manye solempne men and worthi, 
[and fondyng] for to be suche as here Part I V forfaders were and oÞere of here kynne, 
a ‡desiren and fonden and doon passynge | grete dedes and ben magnanimi. 
f. Þe secounde, 
noble men ben not oonli[c]h magnanimi 
and grete herted 
but alsoifthey [haln 
wherewith,Þeyben magnifici, swithe noble, 
and maken grete workes. 
For alwey if oÞere thinges ben ileche, 
Þe children ben more noble 
Þeanne Þe fadres. 
For, 
as it is iseid 
by Þe comune menynge, 
ientelnesse and nobelnesse 
is not elles but olde richesse, 
oÞer olde good igrounded in richesse, 
oÞer vertue in worthinesse 
of kynne and of blood. 
And mannes kyn and blood is most worthi 
if it is swithe riche 
and was riche of olde tyme. 
Panne for oon is Þefirsteof 
som mannes forfadres 
pat was iholde riche 
and bygan to be riche, 
Jeanne Þe more fer Þe children 
pat comen of jsat stok 
ben fram pat stok, Þe lasse mynde men hauen pat such children 
forfadres were pore. 
Þerfore alwey ientellesse and noblenesse 
is more and more for alwey 
Þe richesse is more 
oolde in Þe children 
p a n in Þe fadres. 
Wherfore, 
for Þe noblesse inclinep 
Þe herte of noble men 
to make gret workes, 
it folweth pat noble men ben magnifici 
and in som wise more magnifici, 
gret, pan here fadres. 
Þerefore noble men 
ben not onliche magnifici 
but also Þei fonden 
to make grettere workes 
panne here fadres. 
Þerfore, iiii Ethicorum, 
Þe philosofer seith pat magnanimus 
scholde be magnificus, noble and glorious, 
and he p[er] meneth pat noble men 
by here noblenesse schulde folwe togedres 
as magnanimi and magnifici. 
Þe pridde, noble men lerneth wel 
and ben sleyg and wise and pat is for double cause. 
On is mete and drynke pat Þei ben feed and norsched with, 
| and warde and kepyng of Þe body. 
Þe oÞer cause col. 
is conuersacioun and companye of opere men. 
For noble men ben norsched and ifed with grete besinesse 
and keÞeth here owne bodye besiliche, 
it is semeliche Þ a t Þey haue Þe body wel desposed with good complexioun. 
And for men with tendre 
flesche.and skyn ben wel desposed in sowie and wit, 
as Þe philosofer meneth, 
ii De Anima, 
tendre men hauen Þe soule wel disposed and lernen wel and ben slig and wise for Þei hauen tendre flesch and skyn and good complexioun. 
Also, 
for pat is for conuersacioun 
and companye of opere men, 
for noble men hauen manye onlokers 
pat taken hede of here dedes 
and ben Þerfore excited to avise hem scleliche 
and to lerne 
what he schulde doo pat here dedes be not iblamed 
for manye taketh hede of here dedes, 
wherfore by cause of besy avisement and consideracioun of here dedes, 
Þey lernen wel and ben sleyg and wise. 
Hereby it may be iknowe 
how gretliche flaterers 
scholde be ihated pat preysen alle dedes of opere men. 
And for ientil men 
ben not reproued, 
butflatererspreisen here euele dedes, 
and ben disposed to vnknowe hemself 
and to folwe here 
owne wille and not resoun, 
panne noble men 
scholde lerne r wel 
and be slei and wise 
and so drede repreues 
and be avised besiliche 
what is to doyng. 
Þe ferthe, noble men 
ben politik and affabiles, 
good to speke with. 
For comynliche in courtes of noble men is greet companye 
and ben politik and companable 
for comynliche thei leuen in companye. 
For as cherles [pat] leuen as Þei 
it were solutarie men withoute companye 
ben I boistous and boynardes, 
so noble men doun 
Þe contrarie and leuen f. 
in companye 
and ben companable 
and good to speke with. 
And how kynges and princes schulde haue Þes maners pat ben good 
it is tofore declared at IÞe folle. 
For we seide tofore 
how eche kyng scholde be magnanimus, 
how magnifiais, how prudens, 
and lerne wel, 
and how affabilis and good to sÞeke with, 
and companable. 
For it is iknowe whiche maners of noble men ben good, 
it is to wetyng 
whiche maners of hem ben euel. 
And Þe philosofer, 
ii Rethor icorum, 
teilen twey euel maners of hem: 
for noble men desiren to grete worschep; 
Þe seconde, 
for he despiseth here owne forfadres. 
For it is kyndeliche to eche man 
pat he wol gadry more good 
to Þe good pat he hath, 
Þerfore Þei pat begynnen to be riche 
wolde be more riche 
and Þei pat ben worschepful 
wolde be more worschepful. 
Panne for by cause of kyn 
and of blood noble men ben acounted worschepful, 
Þerfore Þei wol gadry more good to Þe good pat Þei hauen for thei wolde 
be more worschepful and desire 
Þerfore to grete worschep. 
Þe seconde, 
Þei ben proute and despisen here forfadres, 
for comonliche noble men hauen hemself grettere p a n here owne fadres. 
And pat is for alwey ientellesse and noblenesse 
pat is of long tyme is more p a n gentellesse and noblenesse of schort tyme. 
And alwey Þe more olde ientelnesse maken men proute and despise here owne forfadres 
and desire to grete worschipe, 
and he semeth of euel maners; 
for we schal not desire worschip in itself 
for so don proute men and stoute. 
But we schal do | werkes pat ben worthi worschiÞe 
as vertues men don and col. magnanimi. 
Panne for kynges and princes 
mowe not be kyndeliche lordes 
but thei ben good and vertuous, 
Þei scholde folwe 
Þe goode maneres of ientel men 
and noble 
for to be magnanimi, magnifici, prudentes, 
and affabiles, 
good to sÞeke with, 
and forsake euel maners, 
and be not proute noÞer despice oÞere men. 
v Chapter VI 
The philosofre meneth, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
five euel maners of riche men. First, for riche men ben proute. 
Þe seconde, 
for Þei ben dispitous. 
Þe pridde, 
forÞei ben nesche and intemporate. 
Þe ferÞe, 
Þei ben bosters 
and despisen oÞere 
men.Þefifte,fceiholden hemself worthi to be princes. Part I V 
And riche men ben proute; 
for as Þe philosofer seith, 
Þei ben so disposed 
for Þei hauen richesse 
Þei wenen pat Þei hauen al good. 
Pan it is wel iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
pat richesse is as it were 
Þe pris of worthinesse of oÞer thinges. 
And by Þe comyn opynyoun 
pat al pyng is meete 
and imesured 
by moneye and al pat may be preysed is ipreysed 
by pris of penyes or of pans, 
Þerfore Þey pat hauen money wenen pat Þei haue al good for Þey accounten and holden moneye dignite and pris of al oliere 
and ben Þerfore proute and stoute of herte. 
Pe seconde, riche men ben despituous; 
for [if] Þei ben proute 
and wolle be holde excellent, 
and for a man wol be holde excellent 
if he may despise and do despit to oÞere men, 
and riche men, 
for to be seye aboue oÞere 
men,Þe[i]ben ameued to despise oÞere men. 
Þe pridde, riche men ben nesche and | intemperate. 
And pat is for f. o delicate leuynge, 
for comonliche Þey leuen 
so delicatliche pat 
Þei mowe suffre no greef 
and ben Þerfore passionate and faillen, 
and folwen passions, 
and mowe not withstonde passions. 
For thei vsen to leue delicatliche and withoute greef 
and ben Þerfore 
not manliche noÞer temporat, 
but Þei ben wommanliche 
and nesche and tender and folwen passions. 
Þe ferÞe, riche men ben bosters 
and despisen oÞer men. 
For as Þe philosofre meneÞ, ii Rethoricorum, 
Þei hauen grettest excityng 
for to be suche. 
For wise men in here 
nedes hauen nede to riche men good, 
and Þerfore riche men ben proute of herte and despisen oÞere and trowen pat Þei ben abouen oÞere, 
for oÞere men hauen nede to here good. 
And secundo Rethoricorum, 
Þe philosofre seith pat it was axed 
of a certeyn womman 
wheper it were bettere 
to be riche oÞer wise. 
And Þe womman answerede and seide 
pat he hath oftere iseie wise men come to riche men geates 
p a n riche men to wise men geates. 
Panne for richesse 
is most sencible good, 
Þe comynte pat knoweth 
not but sencible good 
acountefc richesse most excellent good and s e t t e p richesse 
tofore opere good. 
Þe fifte, riche men holden hemself worthi to be princes. 
For as Þe philosofre seith, 
pei wenen pat Þei hauen pat thing 
wherfore a man is worthi to be prince; 
for he weneth pat Þe dignite of principate is rich esse. 
For it semeth hem pat richesse is greet good, 
pat eche man pat h a p fcerof 
inow is worthi to be a prince. 
Panne riche men hauen | 
al Þes euel maners, 
for Þey ben so dis- col. 
posed pat Þei wenen pat richesse is more good pan it is. 
And kynges and princes scholde forsake Þe[s] euel maneres; 
for Þei Þei haue grete richesse, 
Þey ben not Þerfore excellent noper he scholde Þerfore trowe pat Þei ben worthi to be princes. 
For Þe dignite and worthinesse of principate stondefc principalliche in vertues 
and in prudencia 
pat ben inward good 
and stondep not principalliche in richesse 
pat is outward good. 
And if richesse is ordeyned 
to workes of vertues, 
panne he r serueth and helpeth 
to oure felicite 
and is instrument Þerto and maketh it 
Þe more cleere. 
But if richesse isordeyned tobost and to prude, 
oper to despise oper men, 
oper to intemporatnesse, 
oÞer to oÞere vicious workes, 
panne by rechesse a man is infelix, 
a wrecche and not felix. 
Panne a man is holde worthi 
to be a prince 
if he is good and prudens 
and not for he hath moche richesse. 
Wherfore kynges and princes 
[ben not worthi to be princes] 
but Þei leue and forsake Þe euel maners of riche men 
and but Þei ordeyne here rechesse to a good ende 
and to vertues workes and dedes. 
For it is iknowe 
whiche ben Þe euel maneres of riche men, and pat kynges and princes scholde forsake suche maners of riche men, 
it is to wetyng 
whiche ben Þe good maners of riche men. 
ii Rethoricorum, 
it semeth pat Þe philosofre wolde mene pat riche men hauen 
but oon good manere alone 
and pat is for Þei beren hem wel in Goddes seruice. 
An[d] for richesse 
is gode of fortune, 
it semeth pat sleyfce 
and witte of mankynde 
suffiseth not to make a man riche; 
for we seen som tyme | sum men pat ben more wise 
and slei ben lasse riche. 
Panne for f. o getynge of richesse is in pat wise 
as it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
Þei menen pat richesse pat cometh 
by destenye and ordinaunce of God more pan by besynesse and wit of mankynde. 
Panne it is skile and resoun pat riche men bere hemself wel in Goddes seruice. 
And pat is pat is iseide, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
pat oon is Þe beste manere of riche men 
for pei hauen hemsilf 
wel in Goddes seruice trowynge 
in som wise pat pey hauen suche good 
by destenye and ordinaunce of God. 
And we schal besiliche take hede of suche speche of philosofie; 
for richesse and al good pat we hauen, 
[we hauen] 
by ift and ordinaunce of God 
more pan by oure owne besynesse and witte. 
And if thei toke good hede 
Þerto in makyng of gret workes 
by worschep of God, 
pey scholde not trowe pat Þei eue to God of here good, 
but Þei scholde haue more in mynde 
pa[t] pei paien to God 
som of Þe gode pat Þey hauen fonge of his ifte. 
And p i s good manere to do wel 
in Goddes seruice scholde kynges and princes haue; 
and of Þe moo thinges 
Þei mote eue rekenyng to Þe heinge, 
Þe more Þei ben holde to haue p i s manere. Chapter VII Gentelnesse, noblenesse, richesse, cyuyle power 
and mythe ben acounted among outward good, 
for riche men be more studios 
and more good pan Þei be myti. 
Sum men b e p ‡noble 
for Þei ben come 
of worpi kin 
and bep not riche; 
and sum been riche 
and b e p not noble, 
for pei ben [not] cum of nobele kyn. 
But as it is iseid tofore, 
it is not oon to be noble 
and to be myty 
noper to be riche 
and to be myty; for a man is myty 
for he | is in som principate 
and hath manye col. 
v Part I 
V men vnder his lordschiÞe. 
And for we seen manye noble men 
vnmigty and mowe not be princes, 
panne it is not oon 
to be noble and to be myty. 
Also we seen manye men riche 
of gold and of siluer, 
of lond and of vyneerdes, 
and lacken cyuyle myt and power 
and ben irewled 
vnder hestes of oon. 
Wherfore it is not on to be riche 
and to be myty. 
For it is iknowe whiche ben Þe maners of noble men and of riche men, 
it is to wetynge whiche ben Þe maners of myty men. 
For, ii Rethoricorum, 
pe philosofre wol mene pat myty men 
hauen bettre maners pan riche men. 
And pe philosofre sÞeketh of pre in Þe whicheÞemaners of myty men passen Þe maners of riche 
men:first,for myty men 
ben more studios 
p a n riche men; 
Þe seconde, 
Þei ben more temporat; 
Þe p r i d d e , 
Þei ben lasse despitous. 
Þei ben more studios 
and more good p a n riche men, 
but Þe philosofre meneth pat Þei ben compelled to take hede to pynges pat longeth 
to dedes of myty men. 
For he pat is in som Staat of myt 
oÞer in som principate, 
for he is a comune persone 
and a solempne and manye hauen eie to hym, 
he is aschamed to passe al fro Þe mene 
and to do not vertuos dedes. 
Panne principate bryngeth a man 
in som wise to be good and ritful. 
Panne myty men 
ben more studious panne riche men, 
for Þei ben compelled 
to take hede 
to workes and dedes of myt 
pat scholde be good and studios. 
Þe seconde, myty men ben more temporat 
p a n riche men. 
For whan a man eueth hym to outward | doynge, 
he is withdrawe fram f. r ydelnesse; 
and whanne Þei euen hem to on werke, 
he is withdrawe fro oÞere. 
Pan if riche men 
ben not compelled to take hede to workes 
and dedes of ritwisnesse, 
Jeanne Þey ben ful idel 
and ben sone inclined to lecherie 
and ben intemporate. 
Panne for myty men 
and princes mote take hede 
to outward besynesse, 
Þey mowe not eue hemself al to lecherie. 
Wherfore myty men 
ben more temporate pan riche men. 
Þe pridde, myty men ben lasse despitous p a n riche men. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
pat if a mytty man dop wrong, 
he d o p no wrong 
in smale thinges 
but in grete. 
For a myty man is in principate 
and in a greet astate of worschep 
and taketh not hede bote 
to excellent and passyng greet doyng. 
Þerfore if it happeth 
pat he doop greet wrong to oÞere, 
he d o p not wrong 
in smale thinges 
but in grete. 
For he telleth no pris to doo greef 
and harme for he 
d o p no gree[f] to oÞer men and damage 
oÞer he d o p greet harme and damage. 
Panne myty men ben lasse despitous pan riche men, 
for Þei teilen no pris to do 
al manere despit and harme; 
but Þei ben onlich despitous to do gret despit and harm. 
Panne Þe maners of riche men 
ben in alle wise worse 
p a n Þe maneres of noble men 
oÞer of myti men. 
Þerfore comonliche myt and ientelnesse 
folweth not richesse, 
but ofte by richesse 
a man is a wrecche and not felix. 
For he pat is so riche and not noble, 
nother is in myghte nother in principate, 
is comynliche intemporate and vnwise 
and is an vnwise felix 
and fortunate vnwise. 
For if a riche man is not noble noÞev | col. come of olde worthi kyn 
bute he is late imade riche he is cleÞed an vnwise felix, 
for he can not vse 
Þe rycheise pat is instrument to felicite. 
OÞer he is icleped 
an vnwis fortunate man, 
for he can not haue hymself 
as he scholde in riches 
pat is good and catel pat [is] of fortune. 
Þerfore it is iseide, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
pat he pat is late imade riche is vnlered 
in vse of richesse, 
for pey pat ben late imade riche ben vnlered how Þei schulle vse richesse. 
Þerfore it is iseid 
in Þe same book, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
pat pe maners of richesse, 
schortliche to sÞeke, 
ben Þe maners of a ‡man 
pat is vnwis and felix. 
Panne Þerfore noblenesse and ientelnesse 
is asocied to richesse, 
for he pat is bothe riche and noble 
and icome of oold noble blood 
and his forfadres were riche, 
he can Þe bettre vse richesse 
and is Þerfore not to proute. 
And it semeth pat sencible good 
is al contrarie to science and to vertues, 
for ar a man haue sencible richesse 
and good he telleth more pris perof panne it is worthi 
and tel not so moche pris 
whan he hath it. 
But of science and of vertues fallep pe contrarie, 
for or a man haue science and vertue he tellep 
but litel pris Þerof; 
but whan he hath hem, 
he telleth gret pris Þerof 
and more panne he dede 
or he hadde hem. 
For he pat begynneth to taste 
Þe swetnesse of vertues and of science 
anon he Þerseyueth pat Þei ben bettre 
pan he trowed. 
Panne Þe more sencible good pat a man hath, 
Þe lasse pris he telleth Þerof. 
Wherfore by cause of riche men 
of olde tyme ben more ivsed to richesse 
p a n men pat ben late imade riche, 
Þerfore he telleth not so greet pris of riches nofcer ben so proude Þerof 
as men pat | ben late ymaad riche. 
f. i Panne for a man scholde not be vnwis felix 
and for he schulde kunne take fortune 
as he schulde, 
it is sÞedful pat gentilnesse 
and myt be iyuned to rychesse. 
For a riche noble man 
of olde tyme can bettre haue hemself in alle thinges 
pan can a cherle pat is newelich imad riche. 
Panne it is wel iseyd for a riche man 
schulde not be vnwis felix, 
it n e d e p pat he be noble; 
and for he scholde not be intemporat, 
it nedeth pat he be myty. 
For as it is iseid tofore honde, 
myty men scholde be temporate. 
For comonliche kynges and princes hauen inow of Þes p r e outward manere good of richesse, noblenesse, and myt, 
thei scholde be ilered and temporat. 
For by noblenesse Þei hauen richesse 
inow of olde tyme and cunneth Þerfore bere hemself 
Þe bettre in fortune 
and bysette and rewle richesse 
Þe more rediliche and wisliche. 
Also, 
for Þei ben in principate and in myt, 
he mot haue diuers besinesse 
and ben Þerfore withdrawe fram lecherie 
and so ibrout to be temporate. 
Panne so it is to menyng of maners. 
For children, and olde men, 
and men of mene age, 
myty men, noble, and riche, 
hauen suche maners 
v P a r t TV 
as we hauen iseid - 
but not Þat Þei ben al suche, 
noÞer we menen that Þei ben al suche; 
but for comonlich Þe maners of riche men, 
of noble men, 
and of oÞere ben suche, 
as we hauen of iseid. 
Also Þei it be not necessarie 
and nedfol pat Þei haue suche maners, 
git Þei ben moche inclyned 
to folwe such maners. 
Panne we prayen children and olde men 
pat Þei hauen non indignacioun, 
Þei we speke of suche | maners of hem. 
For we menen not col. 
pat Þei mote nede folwe suche maners, 
but we menen pat children 
and olde men 
may forsake alle euele maners 
and folwe Þe ordres of reson. 
Also noble men and riche schulde not haue indignacioun 
Þey we rekene sume of here euel maners; 
for it nedeth not pat Þei b e suche, 
bote it suffiseth pat in manye of hem 
ben suche maners ifounde. 
For we menen pat bi suche maners 
Þei hauen inclinacioun 
and not nessessite to folwe suche maners. 
For goode maners and euel ben irekened 
by diuerce agis and diuerce status, 
al men scholde folwe good maneres 
and forsake euel maneres. 
And in Þe more gret [gree] kynges and princes ben iset, 
Þe more Þey scholde folwe good maneres 
and forsake euel maneres. 
For, 
as it is iseid tofore, 
Þei scholde be forme and ensample of leuyng. 
Panne al pat is to preysyng 
in maners of al ofcere men 
scholde be holliche in hem more excellentliche and more parfitliche.

Here bygynneth the seconde book 
Þe whiche techeth 
how a prince and eche man schal reule his maynye in his hous. Chapter I The mater of p i s first s digeste and declared, 
for gerinne it is declared 
where inne kynges and princes schulde sette here felicite 
and what vertues he schulde haue 
and whaat passions 
Þei scholde folwe 
and what maneres Þey scholde vse. 
And by Þes foure it is declared at Þe folle 
how eche man scholde reule hemself 
and how he scholde be in hymself. 
v B o o k II Parti Pan it is to spekyng of rewlyng 
of manye and of hous, 
for it is not inow pat kynges 
and princes be good in hemself 
but Þei be also good 
to oÞer e men 
and but Þey cunne rewle | 
also oÞer e men. 
NoÞer it is col. 
inow pat kynges and princes reule wel [hemself] 
but Þei kunne rewle hous, regne and cite. 
Þerfore in Þe seconde book 
we schal determyne of rewlyng of hows and of maynee. 
But for hous and maynye 
is a certeyn comynte 
as it is a kyndelich comynte, 
if we wole determyne of hous, 
it is to wetynge 
how man scholde be comunatif. 
Þerfore it is to wetynge pat passynge opere bestes man 
nedefc foure 
by Þe whiche we may in foure manere wise preue pat man is kyndeliche comunycatif and companable. 
Þe firste is itake 
by mete and drynke pat man nedefr Þe seconde, 
by clothing pat man heleth; 
Þe fcridde, 
by puttynge of of greues and lettes by Þe whiche man is saued fro enemyes; 
Þe ferÞe, 
by lore and by speche 
by Þe whiche man lerneth 
and is itaut. 
Panne we schal imagene in p i s wise pat kynde d o p no thing 
an idei in pyng pat is kyndeliche, 
and jsilke ben kyndelich withoute 
Þe whiche thing 
may not be saued 
and kepte in beynge; 
for kynde dude and wroute an idei 
if kyndelich thinges were in no wise isaued 
and ikepte in beynge 
but after pat he were imaad anon he scholde faille and be destroied. 
Panne for leuynge is kyndelich to man, 
Jeanne al pat ben imaad to good lyuynge withoute 
Þe whiche man 
is not suffisaunt to hymsilf 
in his lif ben kyndeliche [to] man. 
And among o p e r e pat helpeth to manis lif companye is acounted. 
Panne man is kyndeliche a companable beest, 
and pat companye helpeth most 
to suffisant of mannis lif it may be preued by Þes foure pat | 
ben irekened tofore hond f. 
Þe whiche foure ben nedeful to man 
oÞer wise p a n t o oÞere beestes. 
Pe firste is take 
by mete and drynke pat man n e d e p , 
for among opere bestes a man 
hath best touche and best complexioun. 
Þerfore among alle bestes man 
nedeth mete craftyliche imaad, 
for to opere beestes 
kynde eueth mete kyndeliche, 
as Þe beestes pat lyueth not by raueyne ­ 
as to scheep, regeren, 
and to oÞere suche bestes 
kynde eueth herbes, 
graas and fruit pat suffiseth to mete withoute oÞer arayenge and greythinge. 
And to bestes pat lyuen by raueyne 
as Þe wolf and lyons 
and to opere suche beestes 
kynde eueth mete of oÞere beestes pat ben kyndeliche gendred and ibred. 
Panne in som wise to alle bestes kynde arayeth mete at Þe folle. 
Bote by cause pat pei ben not so pure complexioun 
and so temporate 
as man hath and nedep not so pure mete and clene as man nedeth, 
wherfore mete of oÞere bestes suffiseth to here lif 
as it is greyfced 
and arayed by kynde wiÞoute oÞer crafty seething oÞer arayeng. 
And for man h a p more pure and clene complex­ ioun and more temporat, 
hym n e d e p mete pat is arayed and igreyfced. 
Panne ÞeiЗ whete pat cometh f o r p b y kynde be suffisaunt mete to oÞer e beestes, 
it is not suffisant mete to man 
but it be arayed and ipured. 
r Þerfore it is igrounde and ipured and breed is imaad 
Þer of and ibake pat it be good meete to man. 
<And> for <oo person 
suffysep not to alle p y s , 
Þerforo by cause of mete pat mot [not] be suffisant, 
man nedeth companye <‡> pat eche man helpe opere at nede; 
and p i s pat is iseid of whete schal be vnder­ 
ston|de of oÞere mete, 
for neuer man by hymself alone 
suffiseth to col. hymself to haue couenable mete pat nedeth to his lif. 
Panne it is wel iseid pat for mete pat vs 
n e d e p , 
man is kyndelich a companable best. 
Þe seconde meene for to preue 
Þe same is itake 
by clothing pat helieth vs. 
For as kynde euep sufficiantliche 
to oper bestes mete, 
so it semep pat he euep hem clopyng; 
for it semep pat bestes and foules hauen 
as it were kynde clopyng 
as wolle and fetheres. 
And kynde ordeyneth not sufficiantliche clothing for man, for man is of more noble complexioun 
p a n oÞer e beestes 
and is sounere igreued with coolde 
and with wetheres 
p a n oÞere bestes. 
And so for to haue nedful mete 
and clooth to Þe lyf of mankynde, 
no man suffiseth withoute companye of opere. 
Panne if it folweth 
pat man hath kynde 
apÞetite 
to be companable beest, 
panne comynte of hous 
is nedful and oÞer e comyntees ­ 
as comyntees of strete, of cytee, 
and of regne ­ 
if man schal suffice to hemself. 
But if Þes ben nedful to saue and kepe Þe kynde lif of mankynde, 
it is in som wise kyndelich to man to lyue in companye. 
Þe pridde mene to preue 
Þe same is itake 
by puttynge of of greues and lettes 
to be defended 
fro enemyes and greues. 
For to som bestes for here deffence 
kynde eueth homes 
as Þe bugles and oxene, 
and to som kynde e u e p t e e p for defence 
as to volues and to houndes, 
and to som powes and clowes 
as to beeres and leons, 
and to som sweper­ nesse and swiftnesse of body 
as to geet and to hares. 
For geet and hares knoweth pat Þei may not scaÞe oÞer wise p a n by swepernesse and swiftnesse and takep hem Þerfore | 
to flee anon 
as Þei huren noyse. f. 
But to man 
as to most excellent of bestes 
kynde eueth not for defense homes and clowes, 
but kynde eueth hym hondes 
pat ben chief instru­ ments and lymes, 
as Þe philosofer, 
iii De Anima. 
For with Þe hond we may make and scape alle instrumentes 
and al pat nedeth for defense. 
Wherfore if man desireth kyndelich kepyng and sauacioun of his lif, and a man pat is solitarie and alone suffiseth not to hymself 
to haue mete couenabliche arayed 
and to make armere, 
wepene and instru­ mentis, 
by Þe whiche he may be defended 
fro enemyes and greues, 
it is kyndelich to hym to desire to lyue in comynte 
and to be a companable beest. 
Þe ferpe is itake by speche and loore by pe whiche we ben itaut; 
for opere beestes ben inclined 
at Þe folle by kynde to do workes 
and dedes pat accorden to hem 
withoute lore and teching, 
as an attercoppe wolde spynne 
and make weft by kynde ÞeiЗ pey hadde neuer iseie v Book II Parti attercoppe weue. 
Also swalwes maken here nestes 
at IÞe beste ÞeiЗ 
Þey seie neuere oÞer swalwes make nestes. 
Also Þe bychche woot how sche schal do in whelpyng 
by instyncioun of kynde 
Þei schue seie neuere o p e r e bichches whelpy. 
But a womman can not helpe hereself 
in tra­ ueile of childe 
but schu be taut 
atte Þe fulle by mydwifes. 
Panne for man is not inclined 
at IÞe folle 
by kynde to do pewe werkes and dedes, 
kynde eueth speche to mankynde so pat by speche men mow teche eche oÞer 
and leme of ech oÞer . 
And for pat may not be but men lyue and dwelle ifere, 
it is kyndelich to man 
to lyue with oÞer 
and to be a companable beest. 
Þerfore Þe philosofre, primo Poleticorum, 
among opere resons 
pat he maketh to | 
preue at man 
is a companable beest, 
col. Þey lenyen specialliche on piS resoun: 
pat for speche is to opere 
as to felawes for kynde eueth 
to men speche and resoun 
and not to oÞere beestes, 
it folweth pat man 
is more companable 
p a n oÞere beestes. Wherfore if it is kyndelich to man to be so companable, 
p a n Þey pat forsaken companye 
and wol not lyue 
in companye of oÞere men ­ 
as it is touched 
in Þe firste book 
and schal be touched inneremore ­ suche lyuen not as men. 
Panne pat is for he failleth of Þe manere of mankynde 
and ben Þeanne 
as it were beestes, 
oÞer he passeth the manere of mankynde 
as contemplatif men 
[and] ben panne as Þey it were goddes. 
Þerfore it is iseid, primo Poleticorum, 
pat he pat cheseth solitarie lif to lyue by hemself alone is no partie of a citee but┌is┐┌as┐a best oÞer a god. 
And pe lettre meneth pat Þei pat wol not lyue with oÞer men 
ben to schrewed and froward 
and mowe not abyde 
in felowschipe of oÞer e men, 
oÞer Þei ben passyng good 
and wol be occupied 
in contempla­ cioun and deuocioun 
and ben Jeanne 
as it were goddes. 
Panne alle men and namelich kynges and princes scholde besiliche take heede 
how nedeful felowschipe and companye 
is to Þe lif of mankynde 
and to good lif pat Þei mowe 
conne rewle hemself and oÞer e. Chapter II On caas som man wolde meue a doute menyng pat we knowe not Þe bondes and meres of science, 
for Þe companye and comynte by Þe whiche we suffisen to vsself 
in mete and drynke and clooth 
and in oÞer necessaries 
pat n e d e p 
t oÞelif semeth not Þe comynte of hous 
but cyuyl comynte; 
for pe philosofer meneth, primo Poleticorum, 
pat comynte of hous suffiseth not | 
in al pat 
n e d e p to Þe lyf. 
And Þerfore Þe citee was f. ifounde, 
for thinges pat neden 
and may not be ifounde in non hous noper in no strete schulde be ifunde in anoÞer strete oÞer in oÞer place of Þe citee. 
Panne if a citee is iordeyned by resoun, 
gerinne scholde be al that nedeth to Þe lif 
as it schal be declared 
at Þe folle in Þe pridde book. 
r Wherfore if it longeth not 
‡to p i s book 
to trete of comynte of cite­ seyns 
(for in p i s t is itreted of rewlyng of hous, 
but it longeth toÞefcriddebook for pave inne it schal be treted of rewlyng of citees), 
it semeth pat we passen ‡Þebondes and meres of art and of science in determenyng in Þe nexte chapitre 
of sum thinges pat longep to comynte of citee. 
But if we taken bysiliche heede how comynte of hous 
is ordeyned to opere comyntees ­ 
for in eche 
oÞer comynte is conteyned comynte of hous, 
for no citee nofcer no strete 
may be withoute hous ­ Jeanne if comynte is nedful 
to Þe lif of mankynde, 
it folweth pat comynte of hous 
is nedful perto. 
Panne in pe nexte chapitre 
we tretede of felauschipe 
and companye of mankynde 
declar­ ynge pat it is necessarie and nedful to oure lif, 
for perby it is clerliche declared 
pat comynte of hous 
is necessarie and nedful for perwithoute 
may no comynte stonde. 
Panne if we taken heede besiliche to speke of polici, 
it schal be knowe pat Þer is foure manere of comynte 
as comynte of hous, of strete, of citee, and of regne. 
For as an hous stondep in manye persones, 
so in a strete ben many hous; 
so in a citee ben many stretes, 
and in a regne ben many citees. 
| Wherfore as singuler Þersones ben col. parties of hous, 
so hous ben parties of a strete and stretes ben parties of a citee 
and citees ben parties of regnes, 
but not alle in Þe same wise. 
But stretes ben Þe nexte parties of a strete, 
for a strete is mad of hous 
as of Þe nexte parties of citee; 
and house bene the nexte partyes of a citee, 
and a citee of stretes, 
and a regne of citees. 
Hous ben parties of Þe regne, 
for many hous maken a strete 
and many stretes maken a citee 
and many citees maken a regne. 
Panne in p i s wise 
comente of hous 
is iordeyned to oÞer e comyntees, 
for eche oper comynte conteyneth comynte of hous 
and pat comynte is 
in sum wise partee of al oÞere comyntees. 
As Þe philosofre seith, primo Politicorum, 
Þe firste kynde spryngyng of a citee was in p i s wise: 
first was on hous imaad, 
garnie children encresed 
and weren so manye pat 
Þei myth nout dwelle ifere in pat hous. 
Þerfore were oÞer hous imaad annexed 
and so of many hous was a strete imaad. 
Þerfore, primo Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer speketh of a strete 
and seith pat it is 
icleped vicus 
and seith pat vicus 
and vicina domorum is al oon as it were hous stondyng ny togedres. 
And a strete is icleped of som men collectanei pueri 
and so children ben icleped collectanei pueri 
as it were children of Þe same stretes. 
Panne Þe kynde springeth 
of a strete 
is hous stondynge nei togedres 
Þe whiche hous multitude of children 
pat were icleped collectaney made. 
For as it is itouched, 
whanne Þe children collectaney and neuews and children pat come of oÞere children were so | meny pat Þey myЗt f. 
nout dwelle in oon hous, 
Þei moste nedes make mo hous. 
And so Þei moste make a strete and so come of hem mo children and mo and so v I Parti most be maad mo stretes 
and so most be maad a toun oper a citee. 
Afterward were mo townes 
and mo and mo citees 
and mo and so was imaad a principate and a regne. 
Whether it were poscible pat generacioun of strete, cites and regnes were in oper wise pan 
by encresynge of children, 
inneremore it schal be declared 
at Þe folle; 
but at this tyme it is iseid 
pat suche generacioun 
is most kyndelich 
for it cometh i o r p kyndeliche and is Þe werke of kynde. 
But how it euere be here of 
and how euere a strete be maad 
o Þ e r a citee oÞer a regne, 
alwey Þe comynte of hous 
is partie of alle io oftere comyntees; 
for withoute hous may noon oÞer comynte be. 
For it is iknowe what ordre comynte of hous 
h a p to oÞere comyntees, 
it may be sone iknowe how comynte of hous 
is nedful to 
Þe lif of mankynde. 
For if noon oÞer comynte 
may be 
withoute comynte of hous, 
garnie if eny comynte is nedful to Þe lif of mankynde, 
comynte of hous is nedful to Þe lyf of mankynde. 
Panne kynges and princes, 
for it is here offisto rewle oÞere men 
and to lyue wel, 
thei schulde wete and knowe how hows and citees 
b e p nedful to Þe lif of mankynde. Chapter III 
That we traueille not in diuers menyng in spekyng of hous, 
it is to wetynge pat 
p i s name hous 
may be take for Þe boold pat is | imaad of col. walles and roof and fundament 
and may also be itake 
for Þe maynye pat is gerinne. 
And p i s name citee 
is som tyme itake for hous, stretes, and walles pat closeth 
Þe citee aboute 
and is som tyme itake for men pat ben gerinne. 
For som tyme it is iseid 
pat som citee dude pis oper 
pat not menyng pat walles, roof, and fundament dede so oÞer so, 
but menyng pat men of p e citee dede suche dedes. 
So ofte men speken and sayen pat here hous dede pat oÞer pat, 
not for Þe stones dede pat oÞer pat 
but for here forfadres dede suche dedes. 
Wherfore as Þe comunicacioun of citeseyns is icleped a cite, 
so pat companye and comynte of men 
pat wonyen in on hous 
may be cleped an hous. 
Panne Þe hous of Þe whiche Þe principal menynge 
is in moral matier 
is not Þe boold pat 
is imaad of fundament, walles, and roof, 
but it is Þe comynte of persones of oon hous. 
And it longeth to a morale philosofre 
as it d o p t o an housebonde 
to trete of buldynge of hous, 
for it longeth to hym generalliche 
and by figures and liknesses 
to declare pat men 
scholde haue honest place 
to wonye inne accordynge to richesse 
and catel pat men hauen. 
But it longeth not to hym to trete principalliche of hous 
pat is bulde of walles, stoon, and fundament, 
but he schulde trete of hous 
pat is ibuld and hath ordre to Þe hous 
pat is comynte of Þersones, 
[as it longeth to politicum 
to trete of Þe ordre of hous, 
and of Þe makyng of Þe strete 
and of buldynge of Þe citee 
as Þei ben iordeyned 
to comynte and policie of citeseyns. 
Panne we wol schewen of hous 
pat 
it is comynte of Þersones] 
of oon hous and how suche an hous is Þefirstecomynte. 
Pan it is to wetynge pat p i s wordfirstmay 
be take in many maner wise; 
for som thing isfirstin worke, 
and som isfirstin intencioun and desire, 
| and sum is first in Þe wey of generacioun and of tyme, 
and f. sum is first 
in wey of Þerfeccioun and complement. 
For we seen pat thinges 
pat ben iordeyned 
for an ende 
pat is desired cometh 
tofore pat ende in work and in execucioun, 
but Þe ende is tofore 
in Þe entencioun and desire of hym pat worcheth. 
For pe worchere desirep first and principaliche a good ende. 
And for he may not come to Þe ende 
but by thinges 
pat ben iordeyned for Þe ende, 
‡ Þe manere of execucioun 
and of work is contrarie 
to Þe entencioun and desire. 
For we desiren thinges 
pat ben iordeined for Þe ende, 
desiryng Þe ende, 
so sat Þe ende isfirstdesired. 
But in worching and execucioun 
is Þe contrarie, 
for by work we comen to Þe ende 
worchyng and doyng dedes and workes 
pat ben iordeyned for Þe ende. 
And ÞeiЗ suche workes 
be in Þe wille 
[and in Þe desire] 
after Þe ende, git Þei ben worchinge tofore Þe ende for if Þe ende were first iwrougt and ihad, 
we schul neuere do dedes 
pat ben iordeyned forÞe ende; 
for whanne Þe ende is ihad 
Þe work ceseth. 
Panne on manere of distincioun offirstis 
for som thing isfirstin wille and in desire 
and sum isfirstin work 
and in execucioun. 
An noper maner distinccioun offirst[is] 
for som thing isfirstin wey of generacioun 
and of tyme 
and som thingesfirstin wey of perfeccioun and of complement, 
as a man is rather a child 
p a n a man and for r aÞer in tyme a man is igete and is rafcer a child 
p a n a man. 
But in perfec­ cioun and complement a man 
is tofore a child for Þe vse of resoun 
pat is nedful to pe perfeccioun of mankynde | 
is more and more parfitliche col. in a man 
p a n in a childe. 
Panne by p i s distinccioun offirstand 
rafter it may be sone iknowe how Þe comynte of hous 
is iordeyned to Þe comynte of citee 
and to opere comyntees. 
For in execucioun 
and in worchinge and dede, 
hous is tofore a strete ‡, a cytee, and regne; but in wille and desire oÞer comyntees 
ben tofore comynte of hous. 
Also in wey of generacioun 
and of tyme comynte of hous 
is tofore oÞer comyntees, 
but in wey of perfeccioun and complement 
o Þ e r comyntees 
ben tofore comyntees of hous. 
And it semeth pat comynte of hous 
may haue double comparisoun 
to oÞer e comyntees, 
for comynte of hous 
is lasse parfit pan oÞer e comyntees 
and alle oÞere comyntees 
ben more parfit p 
a n comynte of hous. 
And for alle opere comyntees ben in som wise tofore comynte of hous 
and passen it in som perfeccioun, 
alle oÞere comyntes ben more parfit 
p a n comynte <of hous>. 
Panne comynte of hous is lasse parfit Jeanne opere comyntes and is as it were partie of oÞere comyntees pat r B o o k II Parti ben complete and hool. 
Also pÌS comynte hap itself 
to oÞere comyntees 
as thinges pat ben iordeyned for an ende 
hauen hemself to Þat ende. 
For hous is iordeyned to a strete, 
cite and regne as to Þe ende. 
For hous is fore a strete, 
strete for a citee, 
a cyte for a regne. 
Panne comynte of strete is Þe ende of comynte of hous, 
and comynte of citee is Þe ende of comynte of strete, 
and pe comynte of regne 
is pe ende of alle Þe forsaide comyntees. 
Wherfore in pe wey of generacioun 
and of tyme vnparfit is tofore parfit and parfit is tofore vnparfit 
in Þe wey of perfeccioun and complement, 
it is wel iseid pat comynte of hous | 
is tofore opere comyntees in f. tyme and generacioun 
but opere comyntees help tofore comynte of hous in perfeccioun and complement. 
Þerfore, primo <Pol>ethicorum, 
Þe philosofer makep) comparisoun 
bytwene a cyte, strete, and hous and seith pat Þe firste comynte is a citee. 
And pat schal nat be vnderstonde ofÞe firste 
in wey of generacioun and of tyme, 
for he seith pat a cite comep 
and is imaad of multiplicacioun of stretis 
and a strete of multiplicacioun [of] hous. 
Pan [pat] mot be vnderstonde of Þe first 
in wey of perfeccioun and complement. 
Also for comynte of hous 
is not onliche ordeyned to oÞere comyntees 
as inparfit to parfit 
but also as thing pat nedep to Þe ende 
is iordeyned to Þe ende, 
in comparisoun to opere comyntees 
comynte of hous 
is not onliche rather in tyme and latter in perfeccioun 
and as inparfit 
in comparisoun to parfit 
but also it is rather in worchinge and latter in desire; 
for thing pat is iordeyned 
to Þe ende 
hath suche comparisoun to pat ende. 
And it longeth not onliche to a prince 
and to hym pat eueth lawe 
and to eche citeseyn to desire more principalliche profit 
of Þe citee 
and of Þe regne Jeanne 
Þe profit of his owne hous 
as it schal be declared 
at Þe folle 
in Þe pridde book. 
For it is iknowe 
how comynte of hous is in som wise tofore oper comyntees, 
it may be sone iknowe 
how suche comynte is kyndelich. 
For by causepsatkynde 
may be withoute craft and craft 
may not be withoute kynde, 
al pat nedep to kyndelich thing 
is not properliche a thing of craft; 
but in so moche as it is suche, 
it mot be kyndeliche byng. 
Wherfore if a man is kyndeliche companable 
and to eche comynte nedeth comynte of hous, 
comynte of hous 
moot be kyndelich comynte. 
And kyng|es and princes schulde cunne rewle hous 
and maynye not col. 
onliche for he scholde be companable and politik 
for al citeseins schulde kunne rewle hous and mayne, 
but it longeth principaliche to kynges and princes, 
for as regne and cite may not be withoute hous, 
so reulyng of regne and of citee 
may not be withoute cunnynge 
of rewlyng of manye 
and of his proper persone. 
For no man is good rewlere of regne 
oÞer in cyte 
but he kunne rewle wel hymself 
and his maynye. 
Wherfore if it longep specialliche to kynges and to princes 
to rewle regnes and cytees, 
it longep specialliche to hem to cunne rewle 
v here owne hous and mayne. 
And panne he schulde knowe whiche is Þe comynte of hous - 
for it is in som wise a kyndelich comynte - 
and how suche comynte hath itself to regne and to cite 
as it is declared in p i s chapitre, 
for Þerby he schal haue greet mene to knowe 
to rewle of citee and of regne. 
But' it is besiliche to wetyng pat Þei 
in a sÞecial excellent wyse 
it longeth to kynges 
and to princes to desire 
Þe profit of Þe regne, 
ut it longeth to eche citeseyn 
and to eche man 
of Þe citee to desire 
Þe profit of Þe regne, 
for Þe profit of Þe regne (intellectus regni) 
pat is Þe profit 
of alle citeseyns 
and of alle pat ben in Þe regne. 
Pan for eche man scholde studye 
to be worthi 
to be kyng 
or to be a prince 
and for alle cyteseyns scholde desire 
Þe profit of Þe regne, 
eche citeseyn schulde kunne rewle his owne hous 
and maynye not onlich 
for suche reulyng 
is his owne profit 
but also for suche reulyng 
is iordeyned to Þe comyn profit 
as to Þe profit of regne and of citee. | f. r Chapter IV 
In Þe nexte chapitre it is declared sum del what manere comynte is Þe comynte of hous, 
for it is declared pat man is kyndelich 
an homelich beest and companable and pat comynte of hous 
is in som wise kyndelich. 
But nathalees for Þerby 
it is not iknowe 
at Þe fulle what manere comynte is pe comynte of hous, 
Þerfore we thenken to speke 
som what of comynte of hous. 
[P]anne it is to wityng pat, 
primo Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer discreueth comynte of hous in piS wise: 
and hous is a comynt[e] iordeyned by kynde in to eche day, 
pat is to menyng for eche dayes nede. 
In p i s discripcioun 
som what is declared in Þe nexte chapitre tofore 
and som is to declaryng herafter. 
For it is preued tofore boystousliche 
and by liknesse pat in an hous 
is a comynte iordeyned by kynde, 
and schal be more dediche declared herafter, 
pere alle pe parties of an hous 
schal be distyngwed 
and it schal be preued 
pat eche part of an hous 
is som kyndelich thing. 
Panne it is to declaryng 
in Þe forsaide descripcioun 
how Þe comynte of hous 
is ordeyned in to eche day. 
And for Þe euydence herof it is to wetynge as Þe philosofer distingeth, primo Poleticorum, 
pat som workes of mankynde 
and som thinges 
Þat ben iordeyned 
and ben nedfol 
to suffisaunt lif of mankynde - 
for Þe whiche comynte of mankynde is iordeyned - 
summe ben nedful eche day 
as thulke 
Þat vs nedeth eche day 
as ete and drynke 
and oÞer sustenance 
and bodilich seruyse 
and oÞer Þat vs n e d e Þ eche day. 
And som is not nedful ech day 
as byggynge an[d] sellynge; 
for if men ben in an hous 
and n e d e p ech day 
to bygge and to selle for sustenans of Þe lif, 
it semeth pat pat cometh of I defaute and lacke and of corupcioun of Þe hous. 
For it semeth pat col. 
I Parti Þei doun notas men 
Þat ben at home noÞer 
as citeseins 
butas pilgrimes and weyfaryng men 
if [hem nedeÞ] 
eche day to bygge and to selle for sustenaunce ofÞelif. 
Panne comynte of hous is imaad for thinges 
pat vs nedeth alwey. 
And for not al thinges pat nedeÞ to Þe lif of mankynde 
ben,‡ifounde in oon hous, 
comynte of hous suffiseth not but comynte of strete is nedful; 
so Þat in oo strete ben many hous 
and what is not ifounde 
in oon hous is founde in an nother. 
Þerfore Þe philosofer, primo Poleticorum, 
seith pat as comynte of hous 
is ordeyned for thinges 
pat nedeÞ eche day, 
[so] commynte of strete 
is ordeyned for kynges Ipat n e d e p [‡ n o t e c h e day]. 
And not al byng 
Þat nedeÞ to IÞe lif of mankynde 
is ifounde in on strete; 
Þerfore passyng Þe comynte of strete, 
it nedeÞ to haue comynte of citee. 
It semeth Þat comynte of cite is ordeyned for to haue gerinne al Þat nedeth to Þe lif of mankynde. 
Panne [it semeth] 
Þat Þe cite is p[ar]fit 
as it is iseid tofore 
in Þe whiche al thing may be founde pat nedeth to Þe lyf of mankynde. 
Also for citées hauen som tyme werre agenst enemyes 
to putte of enemyes and greues, 
it is good pat oo citee be confedered with anoÞer. 
For confederacioun of citées is good and profitable 
to withstonde enemyes 
and greues pat destroyeth, 
al withoute comynte of hous of stretes and of citées [was] ifounde comynte of regne and of principate 
in Þe whiche comynte is confideracioun of manye castelles and townes and citées 
vnder oon prince ofcer oo kyng. 
Panne p i s schal be Þe ordre: 
pat an hous is a comynte iordeyned 
by kynde for thinges 
Þat nedeÞeche day; 
and a strete is a | comynte f. 
.iordeyned for thinges 
Þat nedeth not eche day; 
and a cyte is a comynte iordeyned 
for suffisans of al pat nedeÞ to Þe lif of mankynde; 
but a regne is iordeyned not oonliche to reule 
Þe nede of Þe lif of mankynde 
but also to putte of and withstonde wronges and greuus. 
And on cite sufficeÞ not at Þe fui to put of soche wronges and greues 
but if many citées, 
castelfles] and townes holden togedres. 
Pan it is declared what maner [is] comynte of houses, 
for it is a kyndely comynte iordeyned 
for kynges pat nedeÞ eche day. 
And Þat in an hous 
mot be manye Þersones 
it is nougt hard to knowe. 
For as it is declared tofore pat an hous 
is a certein comynte and companye of persones, 
and for proprelich for to speke man 
hath not comynte noÞer companye to hymself, 
if we wolle haue and saue comynte in an hous, Þerinne mot be manye persones. 
And as it schal be declared inneremore 
and as Þe philosofer meneth, primo Poleticorum, 
not oonliche an hous 
is a certein comynte 
but in an hous mot be many comyntees 
and Þat may not be withoute manye persones. 
Panne it is declared 
in an hous ben manye persones 
and what maner comyntee an hous is 
and how it is necessarie and nedfol, 
for it is declared 
Þat not onliche comynte of hous is spedful 
but also comyntees 
v T h e G o v e r 
n a n c e of K i n g s a n d Princes of stretes of cite and of regne. 
And whether for oÞere causes pat ben now rehersed comynte of cite 
and of regne is spedful, 
it schal be declared 
at Þe folle 
in IÞe Þridde book. 
Be it inow 
at Þis tyme 
to touche of citee and of regne 
in so moche as knewlech 
Þerof helÞeth 
in som wise 
to knowe an hous 
and to wete 
and to knowe howe it scholde be reuled. 
Fore as it is iseid tofore, 
in Þe seconde book 
Þe principal entent is Þe reulyng of an hous | and not Þe reulyng of a cite. 
Panne for Þes ben col. 
itreted in p i s wise, 
for comynte of hous 
is so necessarie and nedful in cyuel lif, 
eche citesein schulde cunne reule his owne hous in Þew manere. 
And Þe more preiudice may come to cite 
and to regne of mysrewlynge of hous of kynges 
and of princes passynge mysrewlynge of oÞere menne hous, 
Þe more kynges and princes schulde cunne rewle wel here owne hous. Chapter V Primo Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer meneth pat in an hous ben twey comyntees - comyntees of housebonde and of wif, 
of lord and of seruant inÞefirstehous. 
And seith pat inÞefirstehous 
ben Þes tweyn comyntees; 
for namelich Þese twey comyntees 
mot be in an hous, 
for suche comynte mot be in an hous withoute 
Þe whiche an hous 
may not wel stonde. 
And pat Þe hous 
Þe whiche we speken of heere 
may not wel ‡ stonde 
withoute housbonde and wife, lord and seruant, 
may be declared in p i s wise: 
fore as it is iseid 
tofore and schal be declared 
at Þe folle in Þe processe, 
an hous is som what kyndelich. 
And it semeth pat generacioun of thinges and kepynge and sauynge Þeroi semeth most kyndelich. 
And as, ii Phisicorum, 
it is iseid 
Þat generacioun is Þe wey in to kynde 
and for a kyndelich thing 
fongeth his owne kynde by generacioun, 
it is wel iseid 
pat Þe philosofer seith pat generacioun 
is som what kyndelich 
and work of kynde. 
Also kepyng and sauynge of kynges is kyndelich, 
for an idei a thing were gendred kyndelich 
but it myt be kept and isaued. 
Panne thes twey workes of kynde, 
generacioun of thinges and sauynge of hem, 
schal not be departed. 
For sauacioun schal not be departed fro generacioun, 
for sauacioun may | not be wiÞoute gener- f. acioun. 
For thing pat is gendred 
may not be saued in beyng 
but it haue being tofore by generacioun, 
sauynge of thinges pat ben igendred 
may not be 
but if generacioun come tofore. 
And so generacioun schal not be departed fro sauacioun, 
for as it is iseid 
an ydel were igendredifit myte 
in none wise be ikept and isaued in beryng. 
Panne in p i s w i s e Þees comyntees maken 
an hous be sum what kyndeliche, 
for Þe comynte of housbonde 
and of wif is ordeyned to r B o o k II Parti generacioun, 
and to Þe comynte of lord 
and of seruant to kepyng and sauacioun. 
Wherfore if generacioun and sau[a]cioun 
is som what kyndelich, 
anj hous mote be som what kyndelich. 
Also for generacioun and sauacioun schal not be departed, 
it semeth Þat Þes twey comyntees maken 
Þe firste hous for Þerwithoute 
may not an hous wel stonde. 
And pat Þe comynte of housebonde 
and of wyf is iordeyned for generacioun 
it is not hard to knowe, 
for by cause of children principaly company of mal and feimel is ordeined. 
But pat comynte of lord and seruant is iordeyned for kepyng and sauacioun 
it is not to clerlyche iknowe. 
Panne it is to wetyng 
Þat if oon is Þewlich a lord 
and anÞeer serueth 
as he scholde, 
Þe lord is isaued by Þe seruant 
and Þe seruant by Þe lord 
so Þat Þe same is sÞedfu[l] to Þe lord 
and to Þe seruant. 
For it is spedful to p e seruant to serue Þe lord 
and it is sÞedful to Þe lord 
to be serued of Þe seruant. 
For as Þe philosofre meneth, primo Polethicorum, 
he is a lord pat hath good wit and vnderstondyng, 
and proprelich for to sÞeke 
he is a seruant pat failleth witt and hath grete bodilich strengte. 
Panne for a seruant 
can not rewle hymself, 
it is spedful | to col. hym 
to be söget and serue hym pat is prudens and wise 
to be saued 
and irewled by hym. 
For he pat lacketh wit and vnderstondyng 
is as Þei it were blynd and woot not how he schal goo and wende. 
Panne pat is suche oon, 
Þe more bodilich strengthe he hap 
Þe more hym nedeth 
to be rewled 
for his owne sauacioun. 
And as he Þat is bodilich blynd 
whan he goth, 
bot he be lad, 
he stomblethand boscheth ofte and soone, 
and Þe more strongliche he gooth 
Þe more hym nedeth ledyng ‡ 
for so 
he may busche and stomly Þe hardere. 
So for a seruant is kyndelich bodilich stronge and lacketh wit and kunnyng, 
if he schal be saued, 
it is spedful to hym 
to serue sum wige man and redy. 
Panne it is spedful to a seruant serue a lord; 
so it is spedful to a lord 
to be serued of a seruant, 
for by kynde lordes ben wise and redy. Panne for Þei 
pat ben wise and redy and witty hauen comynliche tendre flesch and skyn and failleth in bodiliche strengte 
as Þe philosofer meneth, 
ii De Anima, 
and seith fcat Þey pat ben tendre of flesch 
and of skyn ben wise and witty, 
Jeanne it is spedful to men 
Þat ben so desposed 
to be serued of oÞere men. 
For by cause of defaute of bodiliche strengte thei suffisen not to hymself 
in doynge pat is nedful to doyng of Þe lyf. 
Wherfore if a lord is saued 
by a seruant 
[and a seruant] by Þe lord, 
it is wel iseid tofore 
Þat to Þe makynge of an hous 
nedeth comynte of lord and seruant for sauacioun and kepynge. 
Panne thes twey comyntes of Þe whiche oon serueth to generacioun and Þe oÞer to sauacioun makethÞefirstehous, 
for Jserwithoute propreliche to speke may noon | hous stonde. 
An[d] wheer comynte of lord 
f. oÞer of seruant be oÞer wyse iordeyned ‡ for sauacioun and kepyng 
v {Danne for a lord 
is saued by a seruant 
and a seruant by a lord, 
inneremore it schal be dediche declared. 
For it is iknowe how Þes rwey comyntees ben nedful to {e comyntee of an hous 
(for, 
as Þe philosofer seith, 
of Þes tweyne Þe firste hous is imaad), 
it may be sone iknowe how to Þe makyng nameliche 
of suche an hous neden Þre manere Þersones. 
And on caas som man wolde wene pat, 
for Þe firste hous is maad of tweye comyntees 
and eche comynte nedeÞtwey persones, 
pat p e firste hous 
pat is maad of twey comyntees neden foure manere persones, 
so pat Þe firste [perlsone is Þe housebonde, 
Þe seconde Þe wif, 
{se Jsridde Þe lord, 
Þe fevÞe Þe seruant. 
But Þe housebond and Þe lord ben not diuerse bot al Þersone, 
for he pat is housebonde of Þe wif is lord of Þe seruant 
oÞer of Þe seruantes 
if Þer ben manye seruantes in Þe hous. 
Panne p r e manere persones 
oÞer 
som whaat in here 
stede makeÞ Þe firste hous. 
And we sayen sum 
what in here stede for not alwey a seruant is in Þe makyng of an hous 
but alwey a seruant 
is inÞemakyng of an hous 
oÞer 
som what in stede of a seruant 
as Þe philosofer wol mene, primo Poleticorum. 
For he seith Þat a pore man pat may not haue a seruant man 
oÞer womman 
hath a oxe oÞer anÞeer beste for seruant Þ a 
t is noÞer man 
nÞeer womman. 
And sum man is so pore pat not oonliche 
he may not haue a seruant man 
noÞer womman 
but also he may not haue a souled seruant 
but hath in his stede sum 
whaat pat is soûles. 
I And som man is so pore 
pat he may not haue oxe nÞeer col. hors 
as souled seruantes 
to erye lond 
and to do oÞere workes, 
and hauen in stede of oxe oÞer of hors a mattok oÞer sum oÞer instrument o Þ e r tool. 
So pat Þe swithe poore man hap a mattok in stede of instrument 
oÞer of seruant 
to telye his lond 
if he is so pore 
pat he may not haue noon oxe noÞer hors. 
PanneÞefirstehous is imaad of p r e Þersones of housebond, 
wif and seruant oÞer of sum 
what elles in stede of seruant. 
Perfore, primo Polethicorum, 
Þe philosofer preiseth oon Esyodus 
|Dat seide pat an hous is maad of Þre: 
of man, womman, and oxe pat erien lond. 
And Þere h e setteth Þe oxe in stede of seruant, 
for as Þe philosofre meneth 
Þere a swythe pore man 
hath an oxe 
in stede of seruant oÞer 
som what elles in stede of an oxe. 
And citeseins schulde knowe al Þe partyes 
of Þe whiche an hous is imaad, 
for if Þe parties of Þe hous ben vnknowe, 
Þe rewlyng {)erof is vnknowe. 
And it is most semelich pat kynges and princes knowe Þe parties of an hous; 
for knowyng of Þe parties of an hous 
and knowyng how many manere Þersones 
and how manye comyntees neden to an hous 
as Þe philosofer seiÞ, 
primo Polethicorum, helpeth not onlich to Þe rewlyng of an hous 
but also to Þe rewlyng 
of a cyte and of a regne, 
for Þe parties of an hous 
ben parties of a cytee and of a regne. 
B o o k II Parti Chapter VI 
It is iseid in Þe nexte chapitre 
tofore pat twey comyntees - 
pat ben Þe comyntees 
of housbonde and wif, 
of lord and of seruant - make| Þe firste hous. 
But if Þe hous schal be parfit, 
Þer n e d e Þ Þ e Þridde comynte of fader and sone. 
For we seeth in kyndelich thinges Þat anoon as kynges ben igendred, 
kynde is besy to saue hem | 
so pat gener- f. acioun and sauacioun ben Þe firste workes of kynde. 
Panne it is wel iseid pat comynte of housbonde and wif pat 
is ordeyned for generacioun and of lord and seruant pat is iordeyned 
for sauacioun makeÞ Þe firste hows. 
Panne in p i s wise sauacioun 
h a p comparisoun to Þyng pat is gendred, 
for anoun as Þyng is gendred, 
kynde is besi to saue it pat it may be parfit 
and gendre thing ileche fcerto. 
But gendryng thing pat is liehe Þerto is not so in comparisoun to kyndeliche thinges; 
for whanne kyndeliche thing is igendred, 
it may not anoon gendre 
and bryng forth such another 
but it mot abyde forto it be parfite. 
And anon as a childe is ibore kynde 
is besy to saue hym; 
but Þe childe may not anoon gendre 
and brynge forth suche anÞeer 
but he mot abyde forto he be parfit. 
Panne gendrynge and bryngtyng] 
forÞ suche another longeth 
not to kyndelich thing 
in al maner wise 
but whanne it is complet and parfit. 
Panne if an hous is som what kyndeliche and we wolle reducte thinges 
pat we seen in to kyndelich causes we schal seye pat twey comyntees - 
of housbonde and wif, 
of lord and seruant - makeÞ Þe firste hous for Þerwithoute 
may not an hous wel stonde. 
But we schal not seie pat Þe Þ r i d d e comynte, 
pat is of fader and sone, 
is of comynte of hous 
in al maner wise 
but if Þe hous is parfit. 
For as we seen in oon singuler persone, 
‡ so we schal take hede 
of al Þe hole hous. 
For alwey multitude cometh of oon, 
Þerfore in kynde ordre 
what we seen in multitude of oon hous is ikept and isaued in oon singuler Þersone; 
and so we seen in oon synguler man 
pat lif and sauacioun ben of Þe lif and resoun of jse firste man, 
but | gendre and col. 
brynge forth suche anoÞer 
is of Þe resoun of a parfit man. 
For whan a man is first, 
he mot be gendred 
and anon kynde is besy for his sauacioun; 
but he may not anoon gendre 
and brynge forÞ suche anoÞer 
or he be parfit. 
Wherfore comynte of fader and sone cometh of fader and moder gendreth and bryngeth forÞoon ileche to ham in kynde, 
and suche a comynte is not of Þe resoun ofÞefirsthous 
but it is of Þe resoun of a parfit hous. 
Þerfore, primo Polethicorum, 
whan Þe philosofre hadde iseid pat comynte of housbonde and wif, 
of lord and seruant, 
maken Þe firste hous, 
afterward in Þe nexte chapitre 
of Þe same book he seid pat t o a parfit hous nedefc Þe Þridde comynte pat is of fader and sone. 
r io And pat to a parfit hous 
nedeÞ p i s Þridde comynte 
it may be preued in Þ r e manere wise, 
for we seen Þ a t thinges 
Jsat mow not brynge forÞ 
fruyt and worche 
ben lasse parfit tranne thinges 
Þ a t mowe. 
Also as it is opunliche iknowe 
Þat euer lastyng thinges 
ben more parfit 
p a n thinges 
pat ben not euere lastynge. 
And so Þei pat ben in félicitée 
ben more parfit 
Þan Þey pat ben not in felicite and welthe. 
Panne pat to a parfit hous 
nedeÞ 
p i sfcriddecomynte 
Þat is of fader and sone, 
first we may preue by generacioun and by natural fructificacioun, 
Þ e seconde by euerlastyngenesse, 
IÞe Jsridde by felicite. 
Þe first is declared in Þ Í S wise for, 
as Þe philosofer m e n e p , 
Þan eche Þyng is parfit 
whanne it may gendre 
and brynge forÞ such anoÞer; 
for Þei a byng be parfit it 
nedeÞ not pat it gendre 
and bryng forÞe such anoÞer 
but it nedeÞ pat it haue mygt to gendre 
and to bryng forÞ with anofcer. 
For Þerfeccioun is iknowe by kynde and forme of aÞcyngby Þ 
e which it is in acte 
and in dede and hap myt for to worche. 
Wherfore if a fcyng 
h a p no myt for to werche, 
it folweÞ pat | it failleth and f. lacketh som forme and som perfeccioun 
pat is welle of werching. 
And a thing is vnmygty to worching 
whan it h a p present thing 
pat is able to fonge worchinge 
and it gendreth not noÞer bryngeth forÞ suche anofcer. 
Wherfore for Þe propre worchere 
in generacioun is Þe maal and Þe propre fongere 
isÞefemel,ifan hous is coniunccioun of maal and femel 
and no child igete, 
Þe mal is vnparfit worchere 
oÞerÞefemel is vnparfit fongere. Panne bareynesse of children in politik lif cometh of inperfeccioun of p e male oÞer of Þe femel 
eÞer of eiÞer. 
Butifmale and femel, housbonde and wif, 
isÞefirstepart of an hous 
andÞefirste comynte, 
it nedeÞ in Þ e lif of an hous 
Þat is of inÞerfeccioun 
of suche maal and femel 
and ben most principal pat al Þe hous be vnparfit for al Þe hous is vnparfitifgerinne 
is no childryng. 
Þe secounde for to preue Þe same is itake by kyndeliche euerlastyngnesse. 
For men mow not euer laste in hemself 
and be perÞetual in p i s lif, 
but in sum wise Þe lif of mankynde 
is Þerpetual by successioun of children; 
an hous withoute children by kynde ordre schal sone be destroyed and desolate. 
For contynual wonyng in hous in oon manere wise 
is kyndelich asifhous 
is contynualliche iocupied by successioun of children. 
And is [in] a casual man[er] oÞer wise, 
asifÞeipat wonen 
Þerinne dyeth oÞer gooÞ 
in to anoÞer place 
and newe men 
and manye comeÞ 
and wonyeth in pat hous. 
Panne kynde habitacioun in hous 
may not be perpetual 
but by generacioun of children 
Þat is work of kynde 
to brynge forth manye children. 
Butifthing Þ a t is perpetuai is col. more parfit p a n thing 
Þat is not perpetual, 
an hous withoute children is vnparfit. 
For by children habitacioun in hous 
is in som manere wise kyndelich perpetual. 
Þe pridde, 
Þe same may be declared by felicite and welthe. 
For children and cyuel power 
and mygt and oÞere suche, 
Þey h e be not v B o o k II Parti essencial to félicitée and welÞe, 
it he makeÞ som clernesse of felicite, 
ioy and welÞe. 
Þerfore, primo Ethicorum, 
Þe philosofer seith pat som defautes and lackes defouleÞ ioye and w e l Þ e , 
for he pat is foule, 
vnworthy and solitarye 
and withoute children 
may not be felix. 
For in al wise suche on is not felix 
for he hath not politik felicite 
with al Þe clernesse Þerof. 
And so it is declared pat 
if an hous schal be parfit gerinne mote be p 
r e comyntees: 
oon of housbonde and wif; 
anoÞer of lord and seruant; 
and Þe Þridde of fader and sone. 
Herby it may be knowe pat 
in a parfit hous moot be p 
r e manere of rewlyng 
for no comynte is wel iordeyned but gerinne be sum 
whaat pat reuleth and sum what Þat is irewled 
and sum what pat is cheef and souereyn 
and som söget and obedient. 
Wherfore by cause pat 
in comynte of male and femel 
Þe housebonde schulde be loord and maister 
and Þe femel obedient, 
in comynte of fader and sone 
Þe fader scholde comande and hoote 
and Þe sone scholde be obedient and boxom. 
And in comynte of lord and seruant 
Þe lord scholde be cheef prince 
and maystere 
and Þe seruant suget and seruynge. 
As Þe philosofer meneÞ, primo Poleticorum, 
in a parfit hous is p r e manere reulyng: 
oon coniugale, wedlok, 
in Þe whiche Þe housbonde 
is aboue Þe wife; 
anoÞer paternale 
in Þe wiche Þe fader 
is aboue Þe children; 
Þe Þridde, dominatiuum, lordschiÞe, 
in Þe whiche Þe lord 
is aboue Þe seruantes. | f. It is iknowe pat 
in a parfit hous ben p r e comyntees and p r e manere of reulyng 
and it may be sone iknowe pat 
Þer mote be foure manere of persones. 
[But on caas som man wolde wene Þat of suche an hous scholde be sexe manere of persones,] so Þat housbonde 
by Þe firste persone 
and Þe wif Þe seconde, 
[Þe fader Þe Þridde, 
Þe sone Þe ferÞe, 
Þe lord Þe hfÞe, 
Þe seruant Þe sexte]. 
And housebonde, lord and fader is al oon Þersone, 
for he pat is housebonde 
of Þe wif 
is fader of children 
and lord of seruantes. 
Panne it is ik[n]owe how many comyntees ben in a parfit hous 
and how manye manere of rewelyng 
and how many manere of persones. 
Panne it may be sone iknowe how many parties 
p i s seconde book hath in Þe whiche it is treted of rewlyng of hous. 
For in an hous is p r e manere of rewlyng, 
p i s book mot haue pre parties: 
inÞefirsteparti 
it is itreted 
how Þe housebond schal rewle his wif; 
in Þe seconde, 
how Þe fader schal rewle his children; 
and in Þe Þridde, 
how a lord schal rewle his seruant and manye. 
Panne it is most semelich pat kynges and princes knowe 
p i s p r e manere of rewlyng, 
for if Þei taken besilich hede Þerto Þei hauen a greet helÞe 
to kunne wel rewle regne and citee. Chapter VII

is most nedefol among tweyne 
and most spedful to propre profit, 
and is also iordeyned for generacioun pat 
is most spedful for sauyng of special kynde, 
and for Þe comyn profit. 
And strete, cite and regne ben not iordeyned so nyge for norschynge 
and propre profit and generacioun. 
But of goodnesse of strete, 
cyte and regne cometh goodnesse to Þe hous, 
for an hous is Þe bettre 
if it stondeÞ 
in a good strete, 
citee oÞer regne. 
Panne if man is more kyndelich animal domesticum, 
a beest of hous, Jeanne animal politicum, 
a beest of citee, 
for IÞe firste comynte of hous 
is comynte of housbonde and wif, 
Þanne by comunicacioun of mankynde it folweth pat man is more kyndeliche animal coniugale 
p a n politicum. 
Pat is to menyng pat man is more kyndelich disposed to wedlok and mariage 
p a n to wonye in a cite, 
and pat he is more comunycatif 
in comyn|te of wedlok 
Þanne in comynte of strete, 
cyte col. and regne. 
For IÞe firste rewlyng of hous 
is Þe rewlyng of wedlok, coniugale, 
and hous is tofore strete, cite and regne. And Þe philosofre toucheth p i s resoun, Ethicorum, 
for man is by kynde more desposed to wedlok 
p a n to dwel in cite. 
Þe seconde, 
man is kyndelich disposed to wedlok 
by cause of gendryng of children. 
For byng to Þe which man 
h a p kynde apetite 
is most kyndelich to man; 
wherfore bi cause pat kyndelich man 
and alle beestes ben inclyned and hauen wille to gendre 
and to brynge 
forÞ brood of here owne kynde, 
for among alle beestes man is most 
[Þ]ewliche iset in wedlok, 
man is kyndeliche disposed to wedlok. Primo Polethicorum and [v]iii Ethicorum, 
Þe philosofer toucheth 
p i s resoun and preueÞ 
pat wedlok is kyndelich to man, 
for it is kyndelich to man 
and to al bestes to haue kynde appetite to gendre 
and to brynge forth brood 
of here owne kynde. 
Þe Þridde resoun 
is itake by workes and dedes. 
For as it is iseid, 
viii Ethicorum, workes of housebonde and wif ben departed, 
for workes of housebonde stondeÞ in doynge withoute 
Þe hous and workes of Þe wif 
in kepyng and sauynge thinges 
pat ben in hous 
and in arayenge and higtynge of Þe hous. 
Panne doyng Þe propre workes 
toÞe comynte 
as whan Þe wif ordeyneth here owne werkes to profit of Þ e house bonde 
and of al Þe hous 
and Þe housebonde ordeyneth his owne werkes 
to profit of Þe hous 
and of Þe wif, 
JeanneÞei ben suffisaunt to hemself 
in Þ Ì S lif 
as it is iseid, 
viii Ethicorum. 
For suche ordeynyng of propre workes 
to profit of [Þe comynte] makej) 
a manere suffisaunce of lif. 
Wherfore if it is kyndeliche to man 
to haue appetite and desire 
to suffisauns lif, 
it is kyndelich to hym to desire and wilne to be desposed to wedlok. 
But if wedlok is kyndelich, 
it folweth pat fornica 
|cioun pat is con- f. 
trarie to wedlok schuld be forsake of al citeseyns 
as byng pat is contrarie to wedlok 
pa[t] is kyndelich. 
And Þe more semelich 
it is pat r io T h e G 
o v e r 
n a n c e of K i n g s a n d Princes kynges and princes passe 
oÞer men in godenes, 
IÞe more Þei scholde forsake fornicacioun 
and al vnlaweful vse of lecherie. 
For p i s is iseie and iknowe pat it seme 
Þat som doute springeÞ heerof; 
for if wedlok is kyndelich to man, 
Jeanne eche man pat forsaketh wedlok and workes 
tÞerof is to blame. 
But if thinges Þat ben iseid ben iknowe at Þe folle, 
Þe forseide doute 
may be sone asoyled. 
For if it is kyndeliche to man 
to be disposed to wedlok, 
no man Þat forsaketh wyuyng lyueth as a man. 
But [not] lyueth as a man 
may be in twey manere wise: 
for [Þeer] thei chesen a lyf 
Þat is aboue a man 
and wol leue in contemplacioun, 
Þeer he cheseth a lif Þat is bynethe a man and lyueth as a best. 
Wherfore as it is iseid of companye politik 
pat he Þat cheseth wildernesse 
and wol not lyue in polecye and companye, 
oÞer he is a beest 
oÞer a god. 
And so we may saye of wedlok; 
for he Þat wol not lyue in wedlok 
Þat is for he wol 
Þe more freschliche lyue 
in fornicacioun and chesen Þerfore a lif fÞat is bynethe a man 
and is as Þey were a beest, 
other for he wol lyue in contemplacioun 
and in Goddis seruyse 
and cheseth Þerfore a lyf pat is aboue a man 
and is as it were a god. 
Panne Þei pat weuen not, 
if Þei euen hemself to dedes 
pat ben bettre Þan dedes of wedlok, 
Þei Þei lyue not as men, 
gut Þerfore he d o Þ not euele for Þei ben 
as it were goddes 
and bettre p a n men. Chapter VIII Philosofres preuen 
Þat wedlok scholde not be departed. 
And to preue pat we may brynge twey resons pat philosofers | touchen. 
Þe firste col. reson is itake by feith and trouthe oÞer by kynde frendschipe and loue pat scholde be bytwene housbonde and wif, 
and Þe seconde reson 
is itake by getyng of children. 
Þe firste reson is declared in p i s wise, 
for no man is trewe frend to anÞeer 
if he forsaketh his frenschipe. 
if we wolle bytwene housebonde and wif 
saue trewe feith and frendschipe 
so pat trewe fey be not defouled, 
Þe housebonde mot holde hym onlich 
to his wif and agenward. 
For bytwene housbonde and wif is kynde frendschipe 
as it is ipreued, 
viii Ethicorum, 
and kynde frendschipe 
is not betweyne persones 
but Þey holde trewe fey ech to oÞer. 
if wedlok is by kynde, and if betwene housbonde 
and wif is kynde frendschipe, 
Þei mot holde trew feyth 
to oÞere so pat 
no]er of hem scholde partye fro oÞer. 
And it semeth patÞEphilosofer 
toucheth Þ Ì S resoun in Magnis Moralibus, 
capitulo Valerius Maximus, 
libro ii De Factis, Institutis 
Antiquis,Þere an hundred gere and foure andfiftywas no deuorse imaad 
bytweyne housbond and wif. 
And Þe firste Þat lefte his wif 
for sehe was bareyne was oon Epirus Cardibulus. 
AndÞeig he semede skilfulliche imeued, 
gut he was not al blamelees, 
for ‡ he trowede pat desire of children 
B o o k II Parti scholde be sette tofore trewe fey and wedlok. 
Panne as Valerius Maximus seith, 
‡ trewe feye pat housebonde 
and wif scholde holde eiÞer to oÞer scholde 
be holde withoute departyng and deuorse. 
Panne it is semelich 
pat alle housebondes 
hoolde hym 
to here owne wifes 
with oute I departyng and withoute deuorse. 
And Þe more fey and trouthe f. 
and Þeer goodnesse scholde be in kynges 
and princes passynge oÞere men, 
Þe more semelich it is pat 
Þei holde hem treuliche 
to here owne wyues withoute departyng and withoute deuorse. 
Þe seconde mene for to preue 
Þe same is itake by children. 
For Þei io wedlok be bareyne, 
it schal stonde and not be departed, 
for coueitise of children 
schal not be sette tofore trouthe and fey of wedlok. 
But if Þer ben children, 
for children ben a maner comune good and profit 
in Þe whiche housebonde 
and wif ben ibounde, 
by cause of children 
it is semelich pat housebonde 
and wif abide togedres 
withoute departyng. 
For we seen alwey pat good pat is comyn iuneth togeders 
Þe partyners of pat good. 
Panne [as] a citee iuneb togedres 
al Þe citeseins pat Þei goo awey not fro Þe citee for it is here owne good, 
so it is [pat children iuneth togedres] 
fader and moder pat Þey gon not on fro oÞer 
for Þei ben here owne good. 
For alwey it is resoun of bing J 
pat is comyn to iune and to abide, 
as it is Þe reson of by g pat is propre to dele, 
distyngue and departe. 
And Þe philosofer toucheth bis reson, 
viii Ethicorum, 
and seith pat for thing 
pat is comyn knytteth and iuneth, 
for children is comyne good 
of fader and moder, 
it semeth pat children 
is cause of here iunyng and knyttyng. 
And seith also pat Þe bareyne ben sone departed. 
And it is iseid pat Þe bareyn ben sone departed 
not for departyng 
of wedlok is laweful 
Þei Þer be no children 
as it is declared 
at Þe fülle by Þe raÞer reson. 
Nathales if in wedlok ben children, 
| not oonlich for Þe feith and col. 
trewthe pat scholde be holde in wedlok housbonde 
and wif scholde abide eiÞer 
with oÞer withoute departyng, 
but also Þei hauen desire 
and wille to abide togeders 
by cause of Þe children 
pat is here comyne good. 
For if som men ben frendes to oon, 
by cause of pat oon 
Þei desiren to be frendes eche to oÞer. 
Panne fader and moder pat louen kyndelich here owne child, 
for kynde loue pat Þey haue to pat child, 
here owne kynde frendschiÞe 
and loue is more. 
But eche loue hath a vertue of acord and onynge; 
and banne for Þe loue 
is Þe more 
by cause of Þe child, 
here owne loue is Þe more and desireb Þe more 
to dwelle togedres 
withoute departyng. 
Panne it is declared 
pat alle citeseins schulde not onliche for Þe good of trouthe and feib of wedlok dwelle togedres 
with here wifes withoute departyng 
but also by cause of children 
to Þe whiche wedlok is iordeyned. 
And Þe more cure and besynesse kynges and princes schulde haue of here children 
passynge oÞere men, 
Þe more semelich it is pat 
Þei abyde 
with here wifes withoute departyng. 
For of euele v n T h e G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d Princes tacche of a kynges child 
may come more harme to Þe regne p 
a n of euel tacches of eny oÞer child. 
Wherfore if loue and diligense 
pat scholde be aboute a child makeÞ 
Þe more vnyte bytwene fader and moder, 
Þe more diligence and besynesse scholde be aboute a kynges child passynge Þeere children, 
Þe more semeliche it is 
Þat kynges and princes abide 
with here wifes 
withoute departynge 
while here lyues lasten. Chapter IX Among sum sectes 
it is not acounted agenst resounÞeig 
oo man haue manye | wyues at ones. 
But pat rigth reson m e n e p pat aile cite- f. 
i v seyns and namelich kynges and princes schulde be apaied eche with oo wif alone we may preue 
by Þre 
menés:Þefirsteis itake be Þe housebonde; 
Þe seconde, 
by Þe wif; 
and Þe Þridde, by children. 
Þe firste mene is declared in p i s wise: 
for as manye diuerse metes meuen 
and exciten to ete to muche, 
so manye wifes meuen 
and exciten to Þe grete lust 
and likyng of lecherie. 
Wherfore by cause pat suche lust and likyng 
if it is strong blyndefc 
Þe wit and appeireth resoun, 
if it is vnsemelich 
to alle citeseyns 
to geue hemself 
to moche to lecherie 
and withdrawe hemself 
fro workes and dedes of prudência, Þat is vnsemelich 
to eche man 
to haue manye wifes. 
But pat is Þe more vnsemeliche to kynges and princes, 
Þe more prudent and wis Þey schold be and Þe more 
Þei scholde geue hemself 
and Þe more besy 
Þei schul be 
aboute siuile workes and dedes 
and aboute sauacioun of Þe regne passynge Þeer men. 
Panne for he scholde not by greet lust of lecherie be withdrawe 
fro suche cure and besinesse, 
it is vnsemelich for a kyng 
oÞer a prince 
to haue manye wifes. 
Þe seconde mene is itake by Þe wif. 
For as it is vnsemelich fÞat Þe housebonde haue manye wifes 
lest he be withdrawe 
with lust of lecherie 
fro Þew besynesse and cure, 
so it is vnsemeliche 
by cause of Þe wif lest he be not loued of here housbonde as schue scholde. 
For betwene housbonde 
and wif scholde be gret loue, 
for as it is preued, 
viii Ethicorum, 
bytwene hem is excellent frendschiÞe and loue. 
For loue may strecche to manye and diuerse 
and by kynde loue. 
But for excellent loue 
may not strec|che to manye and diuerse 
as Þe philosofre meneth, 
col. ix Ethicorum, 
it is vnsemelich 
Þat eny man haue manye wifes, 
for garnie he wol not loue hem 
w i p s o greet frendschiÞe and loue 
as he scholde be bytwene housbonde and wif. 
And namliche Þat were vnsemeliche for kynges and princes 
in so moche 
as of here wedlok Þe sauacioun of 
|}e regne and of Þe principate is dependant; 
Þerfore Þei scholde not mysvse dedes of lecherie 
betwene hem and here wifes, 
but loue of wedlok scholde sÞecialliche be ikept bytwene hem. 
Þe Þridde mene to preue 
Þe same is itake 
by fedyng and norsching of children. 
For by cause of wedlok 
is som what kyndeliche, 
how it B o o k II Parti scholde be in Þew manere 
it may be knowe by doynge pat we seen in oÞere bestes. 
For as som doctourus menen, 
we seen comynliche pat 
among sum oÞere beestes 
onlich Þe femel suffiseth to feede and norische Þe children, 
as it fareth of houndes 
and of hennes 
and of many oÞere bestes. 
Wherfore by cause 
Þat coniunccioun of maal and femel 
in alle beestes 
is principallich iordeyned to gendre 
and to brynge forth Þe children and brood, 
among beestes in Þe whiche 
onliche Þe femel suffiseth to fede and norische Þe children it is no fors ÞeiÞ 
oo male take manye of females oÞer no; 
nofcer it is fors ÞeiÞ 
Þe maal be with Þe femel oÞer no 
while Þe femel bryngeth forfc Þe brood. 
But in thulke beeste in Þe whiche not onlich Þe femal suffiseth to fede 
and noriche children and brood, 
oo mal scholde not take 
but oo femel and helÞe 
while Þe bredyng tyme dureth 
by cause of fedyng and norisching of children and brood, 
as it fareth of 
cul|ueres and of oÞere manye foules 
f. i and bryddes pat sitten on Þe eireyne by steuenes and Þe femel 
b e r e p som charge of Þe brood 
and Þe male sum. 
Panne for to bere Þe charge of wedlok 
in al not oonliche Þe femel suffiseth, 
it is kyndelyche to men pat oo man wedde a wif. 
For thinges ben acounted kyndelich thinges pat fallen comynliche 
and for Þe more part, 
as it is kyndelich to a man 
to be rigt honded 
Þei it hapÞe Þat som men ben lift honded. 
So for comynlich 
and for Þe more part 
Þe femel may not alone bere Þe charge of matrymonye 
and of wedlok noÞer sende to Þe children 
al pat hem 
n e d e p and Þew fyndyng and norschynge, 
Þei it hapÞeth pat som wymmen ben so riche 
Þat Þei ben suffi sant to fynde to Þe children fedyng and norisching 
and al Þat hem 
n e d e p - but for doyng pat falleth selde, 
in Þe lasse part of special kynde 
is not acounted kyndeliche doynge. 
But doynge pat falleth comynliche 
and for Þe more part 
is acounted kyndelich doyng, 
as among men it is acounted 
as it were kyndelich doyng 
pat hoÞe maal and femel bere Þ e charge of Þe children. 
But for among oÞere beestes 
in Þe whiche hoÞe maal and femel bereÞ charge of Þe children 
while Þe children hauen nede to fader and moder 
it is kyndeliche pat oo maal holde hym to oo femel, 
it folweth Þat among men 
it is kyndelich Þat oo male be copied 
by wedlok to oo femel 
while Þe children hauen nede to fader 
and to moder. 
But for al Þe while Þ a t children 
lyuen a‡ neden helÞe of fader and moder, 
it is semelich pat alwey 
by wedlok of mankynde 
oo male scholde holde hym to oo femel. 
And it fareth | not of men 
as it d o p of oÞer beestes; 
for to oÞere col. beestes 
kynde arayeth mete 
at Þ e folle, 
as it is iseide 
in Þe firste chapo itre of Þe seconde book. 
And after Þat bryddes of foules hauen fethers 
and comen to Þew mete and mowe 
by hemself gete mete, 
tranne Þey hauen no lenger nede to fader and moder. 
Wherfore if among suche v bestes 
it is inow pat maal 
and femel be togeders 
and holde eyÞer to [o]Þer in bredyng tyme, 
but men nedeÞ help and socour of fader and moder 
alle here tyme of lif, 
for to hem kynde arayeth [noti mete at Þe fülle: 
so, among men, 
maal and femel by wedlok scholde do as maal and femel done among foulis, 
pat berin steuenis 
bi charge of childrin 
and of brode in bredinge time. 
But for it is iseide 
pat al Þe bredinge time 
amonge suche foulis male and female ben togiddere and holdin hem 
eiÞer to oÞir, 
[it folweÞ pat, among men, 
Þei lyuen togederes in wedlok 
for alle here tyme of lif, 
and holden hem eyÞer to oÞer]. Wherefor [if] he pat wil Hue in wedlok schulde holde Þe ordere and manere of kynde, 
it is semelich 
Þ a t eche citeseyn holde hym apaied with oon wif. 
And Þe more kynges and princes scholde passe oÞere men in goodnesse, 
Þe more semelich it is 
Þat eche kyng and prince holde hym apayed with oon wif. 
Panne it is iknowe not onliche 
by housebonde and wif 
but also by children 
Þat no man schulde haue 
but oo wif in wedlok at ones. Chapter X 
They it be not acounted inconuenient among oÞere naciouns 
as among Saragenes and oon cas amonge o|er stronge nacions 
pat oo man haue manye wifes 
at ones alyue, 
among no men nofcer nacioun noÞer 
by lawe we reden pat 
it is igrauntid to oo womman schul haue manye housebondes 
at ones in wedlok. 
For to workes and thinges pat bien iordeyned to wedloc 
it is more contrarie pat o o womman haue | 
f. many housebondes 
p a n it is pat on man haue many wifes, 
and in Þe lawe of God 
as in Þe Olde Testament 
by som desÞensacion of God 
oÞer for som fygure (bodyng) 
and affeccion we rede of pat on man had many wifes, 
nathalesfcyngpat is suffred seide 
and in a certeyn caas 
and for a resonable cause 
schal not destroie Þe comyn lawe. 
For by comyn reson it is detestable 
Þat on man haue many wyues <at onis>. 
And it were more detestable 
if a womman had many housebondes at ones, 
for wedloc may be likned to foure 
by Þe whiche may be take foure resons 
by Þe whiche we may preue 
Þat it is detestable 
in alle wise pat 
oo womman haue manye housbondes at ones. 
For in wedlok firste is kynde ordre iholde; 
for it is kyndeliche pat womman be söget to a man 
for a man passeth a womman in prudência, wit and wisdom. 
Þe seconde, 
by wedlok and mariage cometh Þees and frendschipe, 
for we seen pat manye werres 
and stryft ben aleyd 
by wedloc and mariage bytwene parties. 
Þe Þridde, 
of wedlok and mariage comef) 
gendryng and getyng of children; 
for wedloc is iordeyned not oonliche to [conserluacioun of kynde ordre 
and to Þew pees 
but also it is iordeyned 
to gendryng and getyng of children. 
Þe ferÞe, 
as wedloc is r B o o k II Parti iordeyned to gendryn and getyng of children, 
so it is iordeyned to Panne 
it were inconuenyent and euel sittyng 
Þat oo womman haue many housebondes for Þerby 
al Þe forsaide foure scholde be bynome. 
For hereby kynde ordre were bynome 
and of suche wedloc scholde come no pees 
nÞeer acord but strif and enemytee, 
Þere is no Þewe getyng 
and gendryng of children 
nÞeer Þew fedyng and norischyng for hem. 
And Þat |Þerby kynde ordre scholde be inome 
it is not hard to col. knowe, 
for as Þe philosofer seith in Poletic[is], 
alwey IÞe man scholde be aboue Þe womman and Þe womman schulde be soget to Þe man. 
Also by kynde ordre 
in Þe same werkes non man by hymself ben ileche soget to tweyne 
ojÞev to mo; 
and if any Þerson [i]s soget to tweyne, 
Þat is not euene ileche 
and by hymsilf 
but pat is for oon 
is iordeyned to anofcer - 
as if a citeseyn is sugette to 
Þe meire and to ]Þe kyng, 
Þe meire mot be iordeined 
and soget to Þe kyng. 
Panne it is contrarie to kynde ordre 
Þat oon be soget to tweyne. 
Wherfore if Þe wif schulde be sugete to 
|}e housebonde for sehe graunteÞ al mygt and power of here body to oon housebonde, 
it is agnst kynde ordre 
if sehe is soget to anÞeer man. 
For Þeig oon man may be lord of many in pat Þei ben manye, 
but o man may not be obedient to manye by kynde ordre. 
Wherfore Þei it be detestable 
pat on man haue many wifes, 
it were more detestable 
if on wif hadde many housbondes. 
Panne it is semeliche 
Þat a citeseyns wif holde here 
apayed with oon housebonde; 
bote it is more semelich 
Þat a wif of a kyng 
oÞer a prince holde here apaied with housebonde, 
for it is more semelich pat kynde ordre 
be kept in here wedloc Jeanne in oÞere wedlok. 
Panne by kynde ordre 
it is declared pat womman scholde not haue but oon housebonde. 
Þe seconde, 
Þe same may be preued by Þees 
and acord to Þe 
whiche wedloc is iordeyned. 
For eche man takeÞ an yuel 
if he is ilet of Þe vse of his owne thing 
Þat is likyng to him, 
it mygt not be withoute discord 
if womman hadde many | housebondes; 
for oon of hem scholde f. lette anofcer of Þe vse of thing 
pat is likynge 
and Þerof scholde come werre and stryf and enmyte. 
And eche of Þe men 
oÞer of Þe wymmen scholde be meued 
to enemyte agenst fader and moder and cosyns of Þe wyues, 
for he eaf his wif 
to be soget 
to another man by wedloc. 
Panne of wedloc 
pat is iordeyned for pees and frendschipe 
wolde come strif and discord. 
Wherfore it is semelich 
pat eche citeseins wif holde here 
apaied with oon housebond. 
And Þe more Þe strif 
and discord of kynges and princes 
is more perelos and dredful passynge Þe strif and discord of oÞere citeseyns, 
Þe more semelich it is 
Þat eche of here wifes holde ham 
apayed with oon housebonde. 
Þe Þridde, 
Þe same is declared by gendryng and getyng of children 
to Þe whiche wedloc is iordeyned. 
For conseyuyng of children is ilette hereÞew v T h e G o v e r 
n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s 
if oon womman takeÞ manye men. 
Þerfore we vnderstondeÞ pat comyn wymmen 
ben more bareyne {Danne oÞeie wymmen. 
Panne by cause of gendryng and getyng of children 
it is vnsemelich 
in alle wise pat oon womman haue many housebondes; 
for Þey oon man 
may brynge manye wymmen wip child, 
m in pat wise may not oon womman conseyue and go 
w i p childe 
by manye men at ones. 
But Þe conceyuyng of here 
is ilette by manye men. 
Wherfore if wedloc 
is principalliche iordeyned 
for gendryng and getinge of childrin, 
lest conseiuingge be ilet, 
it is semliche pat eche citesins 
wif holde here 
apaide wip on vsbunde. 
And it is more semeliche pat eche kinge oÞer princes 
wif holde here apaide wip oon vsbunde, 
for in suche wedlok bareinnesse 
is more Þerlus. 
Panne alle wemmen | scholde besiliche col. 
take hede pat hauen housebondes 
with how grete besinesse 
he scholde kepe hemself 
in clene wedloc 
and be trewe to here housebondes, 
for it is detestable 
if a womman scholde take 
anoÞer housebonde 
leuynge here owne housebonde. 
And so it is detestable 
pat schue take anofcer man liuing here housebonde. 
Þe [ferule, 
we may preue Þe same 
by Þew fedyng and noresching of children. 
[For] fadres ben Þe more besi aboute children 
if Þei trowen sikerliche 
Þat Þe childre ben Þeire owne. 
Panne al pat letteÞ siker trowyng of children 
letteÞ Þe fader to ordeyne 
besiliche for hem of heritage, 
of fedyng, 
and of norisching. 
But if oon womman hadde manye housbondes, 
Þe fadres mygt not be siker 
and certeyn of Þe children; 
wherfore he wolde not do besiliche 
pat he scholde to ordeyne for Þe children 
fedyng and norisching and heritage. 
Panne it is detestable 
if oon man hath many wifes 
but it is more detestable 
if oon wif hath many housebondes 
for Þerby sikernesse of children 
is ilett more. 
Wherfore if it is semelich 
pat citeseyns be siker of here owne children 
for to ordeyne for hem besiliche fedyng, norisching, and heritage, 
it is semelich pat eche citeseyns wif holde here apaied with oon housebond. 
But Þe more Þeril may come 
of myskepyng and norisching of children of kynges and princes pan of myskepyng of oÞere children, 
Þe more semeliche it is pat eche wif of kyng 
and of prince holde here apaied with oon housebonde. Chapter XI‡ 
On caas sum man wolde wene pat 
if oon womman hap 
but oon housebonde pat Þe wedloc is laweful 
of what blood and kin euere | 
Þe f. * housbonde and wif bee. 
But pat is agenst resoun, 
for wedloc schal not be 
bytwene fader and dougter 
nÞeer bytwene moder 
and sone noÞer bytwene men and wymmen pat ben fui nyg of kynne. 
And p i s we may preue by p r e weyes: 
Þe firste is itake by reuerence 
pat is in fader 
and r B o o k II Parti moder 
and in oÞere pat ben of ny kynne; 
Þe seconde is itake 
by good pat cornea of wedloc; 
Þe Þridde by euel pat is voided by wedlok. 
Þefirstewey is declared in p i s wise. 
For by cause pat in kynde ordre men 
scholde be söget to fader and moder 
in Þew manere and do Þew reuerence to cosyns 
and to kynnes men, 
and for suche reuerence 
is not ikept 
bytwene housebonde and wif for dedes 
jsat ben ido 
bytwene hem tweyne, 
kynde resoun woP 
Þ a t wedloc scholde not be bytwene man 
and womman of to ny kyn; 
for Þat semeth so contrarie to kynde resoun 
Þat vnnethe Þer ben enny manere men 
but Þei outtake som Þersones of wedloc. 
Þerfore [in] Polithic[is] 
Þe philosofer is ilad oonliche J 
by kynde resoun outtake som Þersones of wedloc and of mariage; 
for it was neuer laweful to man, 
noÞer we fynden igraunted among nacions 
pat a man scholde wedde his owne moder 
and haue here to wif. 
For Þe wif schuld be sogette to Þe housebonde, 
and it were inconuenient pat Þe moder scholde be sogett 
to Þe sone oÞer 
Þe fader to Þe douter 
by cause of reuerence 
pat eiÞer scholde do to oÞer. 
Also wedloc is not laweful 
bytwene oÞere men and wymmen 
Þat ben to ny sibbe 
but it be on caas 
by disÞensacioun; 
for by cause of sum greet good Þat may come of sum wedloc, 
it is igraunted sum tyme 
in som caas to oo man 
and not to anÞeer. 
| Panne by cause of Þew col. reuerence 
Þat longeth to kynnes men 
pat may not be ikepte in doyng bytwene housebonde and wif, 
wedloc scholde not be bytwene men and wymmen 
Þat ben to ny sibbe 
but by dispensacioun 
and in certeyne caas. 
Panne it is semelich 
pat alle cytesens take not wyues of al maner wymmen. 
But Þe more semelich it is Þat kynges and princes holde and kepe kynde ordre, 
Þe more semelich is Þat Þei take not al manere wymmen to wyues. 
Þe seconde mene for to preue 
Þe same is itake by good 
Þat cometh of wedloc and matrymonye. 
For it was iseid in Þe nexte chapitre 
tofore pat of wedloc and matrimonye 
bytwene man and womman comej) 
Þees, acoord, and frendschipe. 
But for bytwene kynnes men it semeth pat Þer is frendschiÞe inow, 
by cause of kynde resoun wol mene pat contract of matrimoyne scholde be bytwene hem 
Þat ben not to ny sibbe so 
Þat Þey pat ben not frendes 
by cause of kynrede scholde be frendes 
by cause of wedloc. 
Panne it is semeliche pat al men make contraete of matrimoyne with persones pat ben not to ny sibbe. 
But Þat is most semeliche for kynges and princes; 
for in Þe gretter gree and heyere astaat Þey ben inne, 
Þe more hem neden affinité 
and frendschipe of oÞere men. 
For [in] Ethictis] 
Þe philosofer seith 
Þat Þe heyer a tre is, 
Þe more it nedeth to haue greet vnderstondyng 
pat it be not ouerthrowe 
with Þe wynd. 
Panne in Þe heyere gre kynges and princes ben, 
Þe more hem nedeÞ to haue greet 
and manye hoÞe affynes, cosyns and frendes. r io T h e G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s Þe Þridde mene to preue 
Þe same is itake by euel 
Þat is iput of by wedloc. 
For by wedloc not onliche children 
ben igendred and igete f. * 
but also Þe euel of intemporancia 
is iput of for he Þ a t may not be chast. 
For he schulde not be to intemporate and take alle wymmen, 
it is good to hym 
to wedde a wif and to holde hym apaied 
W Ì Þ oon wif Þ a t he may be withdrawe fro intemporatnesse. 
And for fleschlich likynge blynde]} 
moche Þe wit and vnderstondyng, 
as we hauen ofte iseid tofore, 
it is sÞedful to alle Þat wol haue good wit 
and resoun not to vse moche lecherie. 
Panne for bytwene persones 
Jsat ben ny sibbe is kynde loue, 
[if Þei] e o m e p togedres and make}) 
a grettere loue 
(and for fleschelich likyng blyndeÞ wit and resoun 
as we hauen ofte seide tofore), 
bytwene suche housebonde 
and wif scholde be so greet delectacioun and likynge Þat Þei moste eue hemself 
to moche to lecherie. 
Panne it is semeliche 
pat no citeseyns make contracte of matrimonye with persones 
Þat ben to ny sibbe 
lest he eue hemself to lecherie 
to moch and lest here resoun be iblend 
and Þey wiÞdrawe from IÞew besynesse 
and cyuyl workes and dedes. 
Panne p i s is Þe more semelich for kynges and princes, 
for Þei scholde more vse resoun and wit and prudência 
pan Þeere men 
‡and for more perei may come to Þe regne 
if kynges and princes 
ben not besy aboute sauacioun of Þe regne and aboute cyuyl workes and dedes. 
Panne bytwene hem pat ben to ny sibbe schulde be no contraete of wedloc and of matrimonye. 
But in Þe Þridde gree and Þe ferÞe, 
for he bygynneÞ 
to passe furpere 
by cause of getyng 
of som good and profit oÞer for to voide | 
som greet euel and col. harme, 
by dispensacioun may be contraete of matrymoyne. I Chapter XII 
Sum good is good of Þe saule as vertues and goodeÞewes, 
and sum is good of Þe body as fairenesse, 
sweÞernesse and swiftnesse and opere suche, 
and som good is outward good and stondeÞ in p r e manere good 
as it longeth to p i s doyng. 
For worthi blood, many frendes, 
and greet richesse 
ben acounted among outward good 
as Þe philosofer seith, 
primo Rethoricorum. 
Panne if a kyng Þeer a prince wol haue eny womman to wif, 
he scholde take hede pat pat womman be ihit 
with al Þes p r e manere good; 
but he schal not take hede iliche principaliche 
to p i s p r e manere good. 
But to noble blood 
and to manye frendes 
among outward good 
he schal take hede as it were first and principalliche, 
but to grete richesse 
he schal take heede 
as it were by Þe consequent folwyng. 
For it is semelich pat a kyng Þeer a prince take such a womman to a wif 
Þat is of noble blood 
and kyn by Þe 
whiche he may haue manye frendes and noble and myty, 
but for to haue by Þat wif greet richesse and catelle 
he schal take hede 
by Þe consequent folwyng. 
But as it schal be v B 
o o k II Parti declared, 
he schulde take more hede 
in his wif of noble blood and of manye frendes Þan of greet richesse and catel; 
but in som wise he schal take hede of p i s Þre. 
For wedloc is iordeined, 
as it is iseid tofore, 
for j)ew felawschep and companye 
and for pesible beyng 
a[nd] fore sufficiant lif. 
Pan for wedlok is iordeyned 
for to eue felawschepe and companye, 
J a kyng oÞer a prince 
mot haue a wif of noble blode; 
for it is iordeyned to be in pes, 
[he most haue manye frendes; 
and for it is iordeyned for sufficiant 
lif,] he most haue gret richesse and cartel. 
And it is ipreued tofore pat wedloc is by kynde, 
for man is kynde liehe a companable | beest. 
And as Þe philosofer seith [in] Poleticfis], 
Þe f. firste kynde felauschipe and companye 
is bytwene male and femel, 
bytwene housebond and wif; 
and pat were not but wedloc 
were iordeyned for sum Þewe and kynde companye. 
Panne for bytwene a noble man and noble womman 
is Þew companye, 
kynges and princes, 
Þat ben of noble blood, 
for wedloc is iordeyned 
for Þew and worthy companye, 
scholde take wifes of noble blood. 
Þe seconde, 
for to bee in Þees he moste haue manye frendes, 
for pees is among men 
as hele among Þe humours. 
For as we seen in Þe same body 
Þat of inequalite of humours comej) seeknesse and dis sease, 
so among men of wronges 
and of inequalitees 
Þ a t Þ e i vsen among hemself cornea strif and werre. 
Wherfore as for to be hool a man 
most haue stronge kynde 
to putte of thinges 
Þat noyeth and greue p , 
so to be in pees nedej) greet power and myt 
and manye frendes. 
For as Þe philosofer seith [in] Rethoric[is] men don gladliche wrong 
whanneÞei mowen. Panne pat lacked ciuel powere and myt and frendes suffref) 
ofte wrong and moot not lyue in pees. 
Panne in wedloc 
may be ordeyned 
to lyue in pees and perfore 
nedeÞ many frendes. 
And as it is declared 
Þe more helpe and socour nedeth 
to IÞe staat of kynges and princes 
and Þe moo myshappes 
may falle Þerto, 
Þe more hem nedeÞ 
to haue wifes and noble blood 
W Í Þ manye frendes. 
Panne it is declared 
how wyues of kynges and of princes scholde bee of noble blood 
and w i p many frendes. 
Panne it is to declaryng how Þerfore it nedej) 
to haue greet richesse and catel. 
W i p Þe wif most | col. come dowyng and richesse 
to bere Þe charge of wedloc 
and for suffi sant lyuynge. 
And for kynges and princes hauen greet r[i]chesse and catel 
Þat suffisen to Þe lif, 
it is more semlich pat Þei haue wyues of noble blood 
w i p cyuyl myt and power 
and w i p many frendes 
Þan w i p greet richesse and money. 
For it is iknowe pat kynges and princes schulde haue 
w i Þ here wifes outward good, it may be sone iknowe what maner wifes 
alle citeseins scholde take. 
For if kynges and princes scholde take noble wyues for to haue bytweyne hem pees and worthi companye, 
it semeth pat in eche wedloc to g[r]eet vneuennesse scholde be voyded. 
For if Þe oon is not peere t o Þ e oÞer 
but passeth wheÞer 
it be in noblenesse 
and in r T h e G o v e r 
n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s gentrie 
oÞer in age, 
it is comynliche cause of strif oÞer it is cause 
whi housebonde and wif holdeb not fey and trouthe. 
But if oon pat is fui gentil and noble wedded oon pat is not gentil but vnworthi, 
bytwene hem is not worthi company 
but oon fondeb to be mayster ouer pat oÞer passyng Þe lawes of wedloc. 
Also if a swithe olde man 
wedde a gong wenche, 
for gong wenches hauen no ioye 
of companye of olde men, 
so greet diuersite of age schal be in som wise cause 
whi Þei ben not trewe eche to oÞer. 
Panne in wedlo[c] moot be Þis forseyde Þre manere good outward: 
worthi blood and noble, many frendes, 
and greet richesse and catel, 
after Þe astaat of housebond and wif, 
so pat bytwene housebonde and wif sum maner proporcioun schal be holde. Chapter XIII 
It is declared tofore what maner thing is wedloc, 
for it is a kyndelich thing 
and scholde not be departed 
and is | bytwene oo man 
and on f. womman. 
Also we hauen iseid and ischewed 
bytwene what persones wedloc schold be, 
for it scholde not be 
bytwene man and womman pat ben nyg sibbe. 
And also we hauen declared what manere outward good a man scholde haue with his wif. 
And now it is to spekyng 
how menne wifes scholde be ihit boÞe wib worldlich good 
and with goostlich. 
Panne it is to wetynge pat IÞe philosofer, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
rekeneb Þe good of wymmen 
and seith pat bodilich good of wymmen 
is fairenesse and mechelnesse. 
And good of Þe saule is temporancia, 
loue and besynesse withoute braldome. 
Andtouchynge bodyliche good 
a wif scholde be fayre and moche; 
and touchyng good of Þe saule a wif scholde namliche be temporate 
and not loue idelnesse 
but he scholde loue honest workes withoute braldome, as it schal be declared in Þe processe. 
And pat a wif scholde haue bodilich good (fayrnesse and mechelnesse) 
it may be declared in pis wise. 
For J)eig wedloc be iordeyned 
as it was iseid in Þe nexte chapitre 
tofore to Þew companye 
and to be in pees 
and to suffisant lyuynge, 
nathales it is iordeyned 
for generacioun and getynge of children 
and for to voide fornycacioun; 
and semeb more principalliche iordeyned 
to p e s tweyne banne for Þe forseide p r e . 
For Þe good of trouthe and of wedloc, 
so pat wif and housebonde be trewe eiÞer to oÞer 
and leue fornycacioun, 
helÞeb generacioun 
and to getyng of children 
and Þerteyneth more streigt to wedloc p a n d o p thinges 
pat we speke of in 
Þe nexte chapitre tofore. 
Panne al pat semeb helplich 
to make leeue fornycacioun, 
to make | housbonde 
and wif trewe col. 
eiÞer to oÞer, 
and to bewe gendryng 
and getyng of children 
scholde be in a wif. 
v B o o k II Parti 
And we seen pat a moche body helpeth to goodnesse of a child, 
for in quantité of body children 
folwen Þe moder for in som wise Þey hauen of IÞe moder al corpulent substance. 
Panne as in oÞer bestes 
comynliche we seen pat grete beeste of kynde gendreth and bryngeÞ> forÞ grete bestes, 
and so among men 
if fader and moder ben moche, 
comynliche Þe children ben moche. 
Panne for good and profit of children, 
for children scholde be moche of body, 
it is semelich pat alle citeseyns haue moche wymmen to wifes. 
And pat is most semelich pat kynges and princes, 
for of here children 
Þe comune profit 
is more dependant, 
Þerfore Þei scholde be more besy 
p a n oÞere men to haue suche wyues. 
Þe [seconlde, 
among bodilich good a wif scholde be faire and wel ischape, 
for pat is good for children. 
For as mochel men and wymmen hauen comynliche mochel children, 
so comonliche faire men and wymmen hauen faire children. 
Wherfore [if] it is semelich pat alle citeseins 
and namelich kynges and princes 
to be besy 
to haue mochel children and faire, 
it is semelich pat Þei haue mochel wommen to wyues and fayre. 
And it semep Þat fairenesse of a wif i[s] not oonlich good for children, 
but it is also iordeyned 
for to voyde fornycacioun. 
It is iknowe touching bodilich good 
how a wif scholde be moche and faire, 
it is to wetynge touchynge good of Þe soule 
how schue scholde be temporat, 
louynge and besy. 
For if a womman is excited 
and inclyned 
to Þe contrarye of good, 
pat good is most nedfol in a womman. 
And it is i|seide tofore 
pat worching by resoun and folwyng 
f. passyons ben as Þei it were contraries 
so pat Þe more a man folweth passions 
Þe lasse he worcheth 
by resoun and aenward. 
Pan Þei pat hauen lasse resoun, 
for Þei ben suche, 
ben Þe more inclined to folwe passions. 
Panne children and wymmen as moche 
as it is in hem 
fol we Þ passions more p a n men, 
for a man is most stedefast in resoun. 
For as we seide tofore in Þe firste book, 
temporancia chastep passions, 
to Þe whiche passions 
wymmen ben most inclyned, 
Þei wymmen schulde haue 
in sum wise alle vertues; 
nathalees whanne a womman schal be wedded 
it is most neede to inquyre and aspie 
if schue is temporate, 
for wymmen ben most inclined 
to be intemporat. 
Panne alle citeseyns schulde haue alle temporate wymmen to wyues. 
But it is most semelich pat kynges and princes haue suche wifes, 
for of intemporatnesse of here wyues may come more harme 
p a n of intemporatnesse of oÞere menne wyues. 
Also wyues scholde be besy. 
For whan a persone is idel, 
he is Þe sonnere inclined 
to do aenst resoun. 
For as Þe philosofer menep, 
vii Polethicorum, 
mannes pout can not be idei. 
Panne whanne a man 
is not occupied 
in good dedes and nedfol, 
his Þout passeth aboute oÞere kynges 
and is ioccup[i]ed 
in foule thinges and Þoutes. 
r The G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d Princes Panne herby it is iknowe 
what manere thing wedloc scholde be 
and how alle citeseyns 
and nameliche kynges and princes schulde haue hemself in wyuynge. 
For ar they take wymmen to wyues, 
Þei scholde aspie bysiliche, first, 
what outward good Þei hauen, 
and how gen|til col. 
and noble Þei ben of blood, 
and how Þei mowe 
by suche mariage come to cyuel power and myt 
and to manye frendes. 
Þe seconde, he scholde asspie 
how bei ben higt with bodilich good 
as how Þey ben moche of stature and bodilich faire and wel ischape. 
Þe Þridde, 
for it is not inow to haue outward good 
and bodilich good 
but Þer be also goostly good and good of Þe soule, 
Þey schulde aspye how wymmen pat 
Þei scholde wedde ben temporate 
and besy aboute outward honest workes and dedes. Chapter XIV 
For it is not inow to wite and to knowe 
whaat manere pyng is wedloc 
and how a man scholde haue hymself in wyuynge 
but he knowe also how he schulde bere hymself 
to his wif he is iwedded, 
Þerfore to Þe forseide chapitres resonabeliche 
p i s processe is annexed pat we may knowe how rewlyng of wedloc 
by Þe whiche wyues ben irewled is distyngwed 
fro obere manere rewlyng. 
And by twey weyes we may declare pat wifes and children 
ben irewled by diuers manere of reulyng. 
Þe firste wey is itake 
by Þe manere of reulynge, 
and Þe seconde, 
by worchyng and doyng. 
Þefirsteis declared in pis wise. 
For philosofres menen pat Þe manere reulyng of pe world 
is ikept and isaued in oon man, 
perfore among hem man 
is icleped pe lasse world. 
For as al Þe worlde is rewled by oon prince 
and by oon God pat is vnderstondyng, 
intellecte seuered and pured and not bodiliche, 
so al 'pat is in a man, 
if he scholde be rewled Þewliche, 
[is rewled] by intellecte (vnderstondyng) and resoun; 
so pat pe manere | of rewelyng of pe world 
is ikepte and isaued in eche f. man, 
so pat Plato sauede al Þe ordere of heuenes 
in eche resonable soule. 
Panne if pe rewelyng of pe world 
is likned to Þe rewelyng pat scholde be in o Jman, 
and a cyte is a partie of Þe worlde, 
banne pe rewelyng of an hool cytee scholde Þe more ikepte and isaued in oon hous. 
For if an hous is more ban oon synguler man 
and a cyte lasse ban Þe world, 
if pe liknesse of pe hool world 
is ikepte and isaued in oon man, 
moche more Þe liknesse of pe rewlyng of a cyte 
is ikept and isaued in oon hous. 
Þerfore, primo Poleticorum, 
pe philosofer likneb pe rewlyng of oon hous 
to Þe reulyng of a cyte. 
And as it longeth to pis doynge, 
a cyte may be reuled 
by double manere rewlyng: 
by politik rewlyng 
and by real rewlyng. 
And he is lord by real lordschipe pat is lord and rewleth 
by avisement and by lawes 
pat he makeb and eueb 
and not by lawes pat r v Parti B 
o o k II citeseyns makeÞ. 
And whan a prince in a cyte 
is prince and lord and makep lawys and rewleÞ>Þerby Þat rewlyng h a p Þ name of prince oÞer kyng 
and is icleped real rewlyng. 
But whan noÞev prince ne kyng makeÞ 
Þe lawe but Þe citeseyns, 
panne rewlyng by Þat lawe h a p not Þe name of kyng noper of prince noÞer 
is icleÞed real rewlyng 
but it hath Þe name of policye, 
Þe comynte and of citeseyns, 
and is icleped politik rewelyng oÞer cyuyle rewelyng. 
And [in] Poletic[is], 
to Þes twey manere of rewlyng in a cyte 
Þe philosofer likneth twey manere reulynges of on hous 
by Þe whiche IÞe fader | rewleth Þe child 
and Þe housebonde Þe wif. 
For Þe rewlyng col. paternale 
by Þe whiche Þe fader reuleth Þe child is ilikned to real rewelyng, 
and Þe rewelyng coniugale 
by Þe whiche Þe housebonde scholde rewle Þe wif 
as it is ilikned to politi[k] rewelyng. 
Fo[r] Þe housebond schulde be aboue Þe wif and rewle here by politik rewelyng, 
for he schuld rewle here certeyn 
as by lawe of wedlok and matrimoyne 
and by condiciouns and couenantes. 
But Þe fader schoulde rewle Þe child 
by auysement 
and as hym likejs 
and by real rewlyng, 
for petweyne Þe fader and Þe childe 
is no couenant imaad 
how he scholde be rewled. 
But Þe fader gouerneth 
and rewleth his child 
as hym liketh 
and as hym semeÞ> 
pat it is best 
and most sÞedfol for Þe child 
as a kyng scholde rewle his men 
frelich as hym semeÞ 
it is best 
and most spedful for Þe men. 
Wherfore suche rewlyng 
is icleped real rewlyng. 
But alwey bytwene housebonde and wif 
is som forward and couenant 
and som wordes ispoke how Þe housebond scholde bere hym to his wif. 
And Þerfore suche rewlyng 
is icleped politik rewelyng, 
for it is ilikned to pat rewlyng 
by Þe whiche citeseyns 
clepen here lord 
and schewen to hym charters 
and dedes and couenantes 
pat he scholde holde in his rewlyng. 
Panne by Þe manere of rewlyng 
it is declared 
how Þe oon is politik 
and Þe oÞer real 
and how Þe rewlyng paternale, faderlich, 
by Þe whiche Þe fader rewleth Þe child and Þe rewlyng coniugale by Þe which Þe housebond reuleÞ Þe wif ben diuerce. 
For we seen pat real rewelyng is ful and hole and kynde rewelyng, 
and politik rewelyng is" parcial rewelyng 
and by eleccioun. 
For he pat r e w e i e p realliche 
h a p ful and hole [rewelyng] and fre, 
and he pat rewlefc pollitiklich 
h a p not fui and hool rewelyng nofcer symple withoute condicioun 
but bi certeyn condiciouns and couenantes. 
Also Þei eche | ritful rewlyng be f. kynde rewlyng, 
gut politic rewlyng 
be it neuere so rigtfol it is not so kynde rewelyng as ryal reulyng, 
for pat rewlyng cornea 
in som wise by eleccioun 
for in suche reulynge cyteseyns chesen hem a lord. 
Herby Þe dyuersite 
is iknowe betweyne rewlyng paternale 
by Þe whiche Þe fader rewleth Þe child 
and Þe rewlyng nupciale 
by Þe whiche Þe housebonde 
rewleÞ Þe wif, 
for Þe fader h a p more maystrie 
and more hool 
and fui rewlyng of Þe child 
Jsanne Þe housebonde of Þe wif. 
Also Þe fadres lordschiÞe of Þe child 
is more kynde lordschipe 
e r r r T h e G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s Jeanne IÞe housebondes lordschipe ouer Þe wif, 
for in som wise Þe wif 
is acounted pere to Þe housebonde 
and cheseth here an housebonde. 
And children ben not icounted peres 
to Þe fader 
nÞeer cheseb hem a fader 
but bei ben kyndeliche igendred 
and comeb of pe fader. 
Panne pe lordschipe paternale pai 
Þe fader hab of oon child 
is more kyndelich 
p a n Þe lordschip coniugale 
pat pe housebond hab of pe wifFor pei a man pe kyndelich desposed to wedloc, 
if pat he hab bis womman or thulke to wyf 
is at his owne wille and free eleccioun. 
[So as a man is kyndelich ydowede to spekyng, 
pei he speke pis proper langage ober pat, 
it is at his owne wille and free eleccioun.] 
Panne pe rewelyng coniugale 
is not so kyndelich 
as pe rewlyng paternale, 
for in no wise children chesen hem a fader. 
It is iknowe how rewelyng coniugale 
and pe rewelyng paternale ben diuerse 
by pe manere of rewlyng, 
for pe oon is more symple 
and kyndelich and pe ober is more parciale and by eleccioun; 
it may pe sone iknowe how pis twey manere of rewlyng ben diuerse by workes and dedes. 
For pe fader scholde so rewle pe children 
pat he scholde ordeyne hem to obere workes and dedes pan his wif, 
for children scholde lerne workys 
and dedes of cheualrye | 
and of cyuel and dure col. 
suche workes and dedes 
whan pey ben of age and wyues scholde not lerne suche workes and dedes 
for he schulde not vse suche workes and dedes. 
Panne it is iknowe pat al citeseins scholde reule here wifes and children by dyuerse manere rewlyng but pat is most semelich for kynges and princes for pei scholde keepe and holde kynde resoun. Chapter X V 
It was iseid tofore pat in an hous ben diuerse maneres of rewlyng: 
pe rewlyng nupciale 
by pe whiche pe housebonde rewleth pe wif, 
pe rewlyng paternal 
by pe whiche pe fader rewleb pe child, 
and pe rewlyng domynatiuum 
pat is lordes rewle 
by pe whiche a lord rewleb his seruantes. 
Panne after, 
we hauen distyngwed 
bytwene rewlynges coniugale, 
pat is rewlyng of wedloc, 
and paternale, 
pat is fader rewlyng, 
[for paternale] is more fui and hool rewlyng 
and symple withoute condicioun, 
and pe rewlyng nupciale is parciale. 
And for pe paternale rewlyng is more kyndelich 
and pe nupciale rewlyng 
is in som wise by eleccioun, 
also for wif and seruant ben iordeyned 
to dyuerse workes and dedes, 
it is to declarynge 
how pe wif and seruant scholde be diuersliche irewled. 
And pat a man scholde not bylede his wif 
as a seruant we may preue by pre weyes: 
pe firste is itake by kynde ordre, 
pe seconde by perfeccioun of hous, 
pe bÞdde by pat pe housebonde and wif ben peres. 
B o o k II Parti Þefirstemene 
is declared in p i s wise. 
For al Þe hool kynde 
is imeued and irewled by God 
and by angelis; 
and as Þe philosofre seith in libro De Fortuna, 
Þe kynde inclynacioun and excityng 
pat we hauen in Þe soule we hauen of God 
as of hym pat meueÞ | 
al Þe hole kynde. 
Panne f. 
as in a crafty work 
Þat is imaad and iwrogt [by] 
a wis crafty worchere 
is not ifounde to moche ne to lyte, 
so kynde, 
but it be ylette, 
worcheÞ not to moche noper 
d o p superfluyte noÞer failleÞ 
in nedful thinges and necessarie. 
For kynde is imeued and irewled by Þe most wis crafty worchere Þat is God. 
Panne al byng 
Þat kynde makep and ordeyneth 
moot be moost ordenate, 
for he rewleth kynde of Þe 
whiche al ordre comeÞ. 
Panne for a thing 
is best iordeyned 
and most ordynate 
whan oon is iordeyned to oon office, 
for Þe wif is kyndeliche iordeyned 
for gendryng and getyng of children, 
Þarne he schal not be iordeyned to seruyng. 
Þerfore it is iseide, primo Poleticorum, 
Þat wif and seruant 
ben kyndelich distingwed and dyuerse; 
for as he seith Þere, kynde d o p no thyng nofcer makeÞ 
as smeÞis maade a swerd Delficus for suche men. 
For among Delphes were swerdes imaad for poore men 
so pat oon swerd seruede to many office, 
as pore men pat myte not haue many instrumentes 
lette make oon instrument 
Þat mygte serue in many offis. 
But kynde d o p not soo; 
but for kynde thinges scholde be Þe bettre, 
alwey on thing is iordeyned to oon offis. 
Þerfore Þe philosofre 
seith pat eche instrument 
d o p best his work 
if it 
se[ru]eth not to many workes 
and dyuerse but onlich to oon. 
Wherfore for kynde ordeyneth Þe wif to conseyuyng 
and to beryng of children, 
it were vnsemelich pat sche were iordeyned to seruynge. 
Panne it were not kynde ordre 
if Þe housebond rewled Þe wif 
by Þe same manere rewlyng | 
by Þe whiche a col. lord 
rewleth his seruantes. 
But fceig it be in p i s wise by kynde ordre, 
git among som men and nacions, 
among barbares and stronge men, 
Þe wif is seruant, 
as Þe philosofer seith, 
i Poleticorum, 
and seith pat among bárbaros and stronge men, 
wif and seruant hauen Þe same ordre for Þei vsed here wifes as seruantes. 
But pat was, 
as it is iseid Þere, 
for among suche barbares 
is no kyndelich prince; 
but swiche [barbareis 
Þen kyndelich straunge and seruant, 
[for] he is barbarus 
pat is strange to a man 
and ‡ 
is not vnderstonde of hym, 
for a man is barbarus 
to anoÞcer 
for Þse oÞer vnderstondeÞ hym not. 
And so a Duchesch man 
is barbarus to an Italian 
and a Italian is barbarus to an Englische man. 
And he is symÞelliche barbarus 
withoute condicioun 
pat is strange to hymself 
and woot not 
what he hymself meneth; but pat may not Þe 
but hym lacke vnderstondyng 
and vse of reson. 
And for he pat lacked vse of resoun 
is kyndelich a seruant for he 
can not rewle hymself, 
it is spedful to hym to Þe rewled of som oÞer. 
He pat is barbarus 
by kynde is seruant Þe kynde. 
Wherfore if among Þe barbarus 
wif and seruant haue Þe s 
a m e r r v T h e G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s ordre, 
Þat is for defaute of reson; 
for Þey kunne not distyngwe 
bytwene Þe manere of rewelyng of wif and of seruant. 
Wherfore if it is semelich 
pat alle citeseyns 
be wise and redy 
and knowe þe kynde manere and ordre, 
it is vnsemelich to hem 
to vse here 
wyfes as seruantes. 
Bot pat is more vnsemelich for kynges and princes, 
for it is more vnsemelich 
pat Þei ben barbarus 
and lacke wit and resoun. 
Panne by kynde ordre 
it is declared pat rewlyng coniugale 
and rewlyng seruyle ben diuerse and pat wifes 
scholde not be ivsed as seruantes; 
by rewelyng coniugale þe housebonde rewleþþewifand | 
f by rewelyng seruyle þe lord rewleth his seruantes. 
Þe seconde wey to preue 
þe same is itake by perfeccioun of hous. 
For an hous semeth vnparfit wiþ scarsete of thinges 
and not suffisaunt 
to hitself in leuynge if wif and seruant 
hauen the same ordre. 
Þerfore it is iseid, 
vi Poleticorum, 
pat pore men, 
[for þei] hauen not many seruantes 
noþer piente of thinges 
pat nedeþ to þe perfeccioun of an hous, 
þei vsen here wifes and children 
as it were seruantes. 
Þe þridde mene is itake 
by pat pat housebonde and wif ben peres. 
For þei þe housebonde 
be aboue þe wif, 
he can more resoun; 
it he scholde not be so moche aboue here 
pat he scholde vse here 
as a seruant 
but as a felawe. 
For þe housebonde is not so moche aboue þe wif 
as þe lord is aboue þe seruant, 
but þe housebonde 
and wif ben acounted peres in som wise. 
r Chapter XVI 
As in þe firste [book we hauen iseid], 
vniuersale speche helpeþ [lasse] in moral mater. 
Panne it is al oþer 
to trete of wedloc 
and of rewlyng of wedlok 
þan it is to trete of rewlyng of children and of seruantes. 
And to declare hou þe housebond 
schal haue hym to his wif 
and pat a schal haue [hym] 
oþer wyse to his wif 
þan to seruantes and children, 
suche declarynge is ful vnyuersal techynge and lore of wedloc 
and what manere thing wedloc is 
and how it scholde be ivsed. 
Panne we mote come adoune more particulerliche 
and declare how alle citeseyns 
and nameliche kynges and princes scholde vse þe copulacioun of wedloc. 
Panne vnyuersal speche in moral matere scholde not be forsake; 
for ofte ‡whan þe vniuersales ben vnknowe, 
þe particulers ben vnknowe. 
Nabales particuler speche | scholde be do to vniuersal speche, 
for moral col. matier stondeþ 
in singuler as þe philosofer meneþ,ii Ethicorum. 
Þerfore in suche doynge particuler speche helpeþ most. 
Þerfore it is to declarynge particulerlich 
in what age wedloc schulde be vsed, 
† and þat we may declare 
by foure resons†: 
þe firste is itake 
by hurtynge and greuynge of children; 
þe seconde, 
by þe intemporatnesse of wymmen; 
þe þridde, 
by pereles of hem; 
þe ferþe, 
by euel and harme of men. 
B o o k II Parti Þefirsteresoun is declared in p i s wise. 
For if housebonde and wif gendreÞe togedres to gong, 
as Þe philosofer preueth [in Pol]ethic[is], 
Þe children ben ihurt in Þe body. 
For comynlichÞei ben feble in body and inparfit, 
and ben also ihert in Þe soule: 
for comynliche Þei 
þat ben so ibore lacken good wit and resoun. 
And so we seen in oÞer kynde kynges; 
for whan a thing gendreth and bryngeÞe 
forÞ anoþcer if Þe thing 
Þat gendreth is inparfit, 
Þe þyng pat is igendred mot be inparfit. 
As if an hoot thing gendreth heete if pat hoot þyng 
is not parfitliche hoot, 
Þe heete Þat comef) 
þerof is inparfit. 
Also if a þyng schal be maad hoot, 
it mot be disposed to [f]onge heete; 
and if it is inparfitliche disposed to suche fongynge, 
it fongeth suche heete inparfitliche. 
Wherfore if Þe coniunccioun 
of wif and housebonde 
nedeÞ to Þe † Þerfecciounf of children, 
if Þe housebonde and wif ben to gonge for here bodyes ben inparfit 
[and] ben not icome to Þew complement, 
children Þat comen of suche coniunccioun 
ben inparfit and feble of body. 
Wherfore of gendryng 
in to gong age comeþ hurtynge of bodyes of chil|dren. f. 
Also by suche coniunccioun children ben ihert not onlich in body 
but also in soule. 
For by cause þat Þe soule 
folweÞe Þe complexioun of Þe body, 
whan a man is not wel proporcionate noÞer disposed in Þe body 
noÞer wel complexionate his soule is ilette 
Þat it may not wel knowe thinges 
þat he scholde knowe noÞer 
do actus 
and dedes of greet wit and wynnynge. 
Panne children pat comeþ 
of suche genera­ 
cioun ben inparfit 
not oonlich in bodye 
but also in soule. 
þanne it is semeliche 
þat no citeseyns vse wedloc whileÞei ben to зoung; 
but Þat is most semeliche for kynges and princes for Þei scholde be more besi pat h[ere] children 
ben faire and wel ischaÞe of body 
and wis and wiзti. 
Panne þ o u з 
Þey wedde wifes in gonge age, 
Þei scholde not vse 
Þe dede of wedloc 
but in parfit age. 
Þe seconde for to preue 
Þe same is itake 
by intemporatnesse of wymmen. 
For if wymmen pat ben to yonge v s e p Þe dede of wedloc, 
not onlich children ben ihert 
but also Þe wymmen ben in al intemporat and lechours. 
For eche Þersoun 
h a p greet desire and greet talent to Þyng pat h e vseþ in greet gouÞe. 
Þerfore, vii Poleticorum, 
it is iseid 
pat þilke wymmen 
ben most intemporat pat vseþ 
Þe dede of wedloc 
while Þei ben gonge wenches. 
Þe Þridde mene 
is itake by Þerei of wymmen. 
For as it is iseid [in] Polethic[is], 
for in trauaille of child gonge wenches 
hauen most woo and sorwe 
and Þerfore manye ben ilost and iÞerisched, 
Þerfore as Þe philosofer meneÞe 
it was an vsage among nacions 
in olde tyme 
to make special prayers 
for gonge wenches 
in trauaile of child in tokyn 
þat зong wennches ben in more peril p a n oÞere wymmen. 
Þe ferÞe mene is itake 
by euel and harm of Þe hous[bonde]. 
| House­ col. bondes ben ihert and hauen harme if Þei vsen 
Þe dede of wedloc 
in v T h e G o v e r 
n a n c e o f K i n g s a n d Pr i n c 
e s greet зouthe. 
Þerfore it is iseid [in] Poleticfis] 
þat bodies of maales 
ben ihurtifþeivsen lecherie 
in greet зouþe. 
Wherfore if suche harme may come of vse of wedloc in to greet gouþe to housebondes, wyues, and children, 
kynges and princes scholde principaliche forsake þe dede of wedloc 
in to greet uthe. 
But if it is iaxed 
what tyme nedeÞ in wyfes, 
it semeþ þat þe philosofer wol mene þat Þe wif scholde be eitene ere oold; 
and Þe housebond most be more. 
For if it is greuous to maales to vse Þe dedes of wedloc 
al Þe wexyng tyme, 
and comynliche in men 
Þe wexinge tyme conteyneþ þr y e s seuene зeer, 
it semeþ þat after þe þridde seuene зeer 
is good tyme 
to vse þe dedes of wedloc. 
But for þe vertue of generacioun scholde not be to swythe corrupte, 
it may be doo tofore suche a tyme 
if it semeþ 
þat it is to doyng. Chapter XVII The philosofer, 
[v]ii Poleticorum, 
after pat he preuede by manie resons pat me scholde not vse þe dede of wedloc 
in to greet gouþe, 
he inquyreth what tyme 
it is best to gendre 
and to gete children. 
And seith pat boþe natural clerkes and phisicians graunteþ 
þat it is bettre 
to vse þe dede of wedloc 
in coold tyme 
whanne þe norþerne 
wynd bloweth banne in hoot tyme 
whanne þe southerne wynd bloweth. 
And þis we may preue by þre 
weyes:þefirsteis itake by wymmen; 
þe seconde, 
by hurtynge of housebondes; 
þe þirdde, 
by disposicioun of þe eyre. 
Sum men assignethþefirstewey in þis wise. 
For in hoot tyme smale hooles and pores of þe body 
ben oÞene and þe moystere | passeth out f. 
and þe bodies ben drye. 
Also whanne þe smale holes 
and pores ben opene, 
kynde hete passeþ out 
and þe bodies ben colde wiþinne. 
And þis eche man may knowe in hymself; 
for in cold tyme whanne þe northerne wynd bloweth is best digestioun, 
for þanne colde holdeþ inne kynde hete and passeþ not out 
but is igendred wiþinne 
and is þe more strong. 
Wherfore in wynter tyme 
whanne northerne wynd bloweþ 
men ben more hoot, 
for kynde heete passeþ not out, 
and ben þe more moyst, 
for þe moystere Þey ben wiþinne, 
‡men ben þe more able to generacioun and getynge of children. 
And on caas 
in a suche tyme ben moost males igendred and igete. 
And þerfore it semeth 
pat þe philosofer 
wolde mene pat scheep conceyueth males 
whan þe northerne wynd bloweth and femeles 
whan þe southerne wynd blow­ eb­ 
And in alle wyse whanne þe northerne wynd bloweþ 
þe hete of þe moder wombe is þe more myзty and strong and þe moder may þe better kepe and saue whaat schue conceyueþ. 
Þe seconde to preue þe same is itake by hurtynge of housbondes. 
For housebondes ben more ihurt and igreued if Þey vsen þe dede of wedloc 
in hoot tyme 
whanne þe southerne wynd bloweth þanne in r B o o k II 
Parti coold tyme 
whanne Þe northerne wynd bloweþ; 
for whanne Þe cold northerne wynd bloweth, 
kynde heete is more ikepte wypinne 
and we hauen better digestioun and mete and drynke turneþ more to norishyng. 
Wherfore in suche a tyme vse of Þe dede of wedloc greueth not bodies of men 
so sore noþer aÞeyreth | hem, 
for mete and drynke col. 
turneþ more to norisching. 
Þe þridde wey to preue 
Þe same is itake 
by Þe eire 
and by disposicioun þerof. 
For Þe northerne wynd makeþ 
Þe eyre pure and cleer 
and Þe southerne wynd maketh it trouble and þikke. 
For as Þe philosofer seith [in] Metheor[is], 
Þe southerne wynd bryngeþ moche reyn; 
and whanne Þe e i r 
e is pure and cleer, 
Þe complexioun of hem pat ben þerinne ben 
Þe bettere and Þanne is best generacioun. 
Wherfore in suche a tyme 
Þe dede of wedloc 
scholde be most ivsed. 
And it is semelich 
pat alle citeseyns vse 
Þe dede of wedloc 
in Þe tyme in Þe whiche is best generacioun and getynge of children. 
But þat is most semelich for kynges and princes, 
for it is semeliche 
pat Þei haue moost semelich children 
and wel ischaÞe. Chapter XVIII Comynliche in maners wymmen faren as children. 
In sum wise femeles ben, 
oÞer semeþ þat Þei ben, 
in comparisoun to maules as children 
of inparfit age to men of fol age. 
For as Þe philosofer seith [in] Poletic[is], 
maules kunneþ more resoun 
p a n femelles, 
for femel is as it were a maule ilikned 
and as a man not compleet and parfit. 
Also children cunneþ 
not so moche resoun 
as men of ful age, 
for a childe is as it were a man 
not compleet and parfit. 
Panne for in comparisoun 
to not compleet Þerfeccioun 
and to Þe vse of resoun 
in som wise wymmen 
and children hauen Þe s a m e resoun. 
And so it folweth pat 
in som wise 
in maneres wymmen varieth as children. 
In Þe firste book 
Þere we treted vnyuersaliche of maners 
and of þewes we made no sÞecial chapitre 
of | maners and of 
})ewes ‡ of f. wymmen, 
but we supposede pat m 
e myte coniecte and gesse 
of suche maners [of maners] of children. 
But for in p i s seconde book 
Þe rewlyng of wyues axen 
a special tretes 
pat we may wete and knowe 
by whaat rewelyng 
wyues scholde be rewled, 
it is schortlych to rekenyng 
what is to preysyng 
and what is to blamyng in wymmen. 
Andfirst,wymmen ben to preysynge, 
for Þei ben comynlich schamefast and pat is for double cause: first, 
for Þei desiren to be preysed; 
Þe seconde, 
for Þei ben ferful of herte. 
And wymmen desiren greetlich to be preysed 
for al Þat ben inparfit desiren more to be ipreysed 
p a n þulke pat ben parfit, 
as inparfit Clerkes pat hauen vnparfite connynge desiren more to be cleped cunnynge 
and to haue Þe name patÞeib 
e n excellent Clerkes 
p a n don Clerkes 
Þat ben verreyliche cunnynge. 
For v T h e G 
o v e r 
n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s þei pat ben verreyliche connynge 
hauen ioye of pat pat 
is in hymself and reccheþ not þerfore so moche to be holde connyng. 
But þei pat ben inparfitlich conyng, 
for þei fynden non connyng in hemself 
wherof he scholde be glad, 
what þei hauen not in dede 
Þey wolle haue in opynyoun of man. 
Panne what is iseid of parfit connynge and vnparfit 
schal be vnderstonde of parfit goodnesse and vnparfit. 
For þei pat ben parfitliche good desiren not so moche to be preysed 
and iholde good as dob oþere pat ben vnparfitlich good; 
for þei pat ben parfitliche good mowe [ben] glad of pat þei hauen in hemself 
and reccheb þerfore 
but lite to haue ioye of opynyoun of men. 
Wherfore by cause pat wymen ben not comynliche so good as men, 
if |Þeyhauen eny goodnesse as col. goodnesse of body ­ 
as if þei ben faire and semeliche 
oþer hauen eny oþer goodnesse ­ 
þei desiren moche to be preysed. 
And al pat comeþ of inperfeccioun of goodnesse, 
for goodnesse of þe body 
as fairenesse and semlich schap 
and obere suche is inparfit goodnesse. 
Panne comyn­ lich wymmen hauen inparfit goodnesse 
as goodnesse of þe body. 
And if þei 
[hau]en parfit goodnesse 
as goodnesse of þe <soule>, 
þei hauen pat goodnesse in an vnparfit manere 
in so moche pat comyn­ liche wymmen failen moche of perfeccioun of men. 
And for by wexinge of parfit goodnesse desire of preysyng abateth, 
comynlich for to speke þe more vnparfit wymmen ben passyng men 
þe more he desireth 
to be preysed more þan men. 
Wherfore by cause pat 
schamefastnesse is drede of vnworschep 
and of lost of preysyng, 
wymmen ben schamefast for þei dreden vnworschip 
and lost of preysyng pat þei louen so gretlich. 
Panne by desire of preysyng 
it is preued pat wymmen ben schamefast. 
Also þe same may be preued by ferfolnesse of herte. 
For by cause pat wymmen ben alwey kyndelich ferfol and dreden 
n y з al þyng, 
it folweth pat þei ben schamefast. 
For schamefastnesse 
is a manere drede 
as it is iseide tofore. 
Panne by diuerse causes 
we may preue pat wymmen ben schame­ fast. 
But hou it euere be of þe cause þerof, 
wymmen [scholde] ben schamefast; 
for by cause of schamefastnesse 
þei leuen and forsaken many foule dedes 
þe whiche þei wolde not leue noþer forsake ner 
pat þei ben constreyned and wiþholde | 
by chaynes of schamefastnesse. 
f. Þe seconde, 
wymmen ben to preysyng, 
for comynlich þei ben mylde and merciable. 
For comynliche wymmen, 
children and olde men ben merciable 
but not for þe same cause. 
For as it is iseid tofore, 
children ben merciable for þei ben innocent and demiþ and trowiþ 
pat oþir ben innocent 
and hauin harme with wronge 
and hauin þerfore sone merci of hem. 
And olde men ben merciable 
for þei faillen in body and lif, 
and hauen mercy and rewþe of obere men for oþere men scholde haue mercye and rewþe of hem. 
For man is sone inclined for to do to 
oþere men as he wolde pat obere men dede to hym, 
þerfore olde men hauen r B 
o o k II Parti sone mercye and rewÞe of oÞere men. 
And wymmen ben merciable 
for suffry hard doyng. 
Þerfore wymmen hauen mercye and rewÞe anon whanne he s e e Þ 
oÞere suffre harde Þeyns. 
Þe Þridde is to wetynge of wymmen, 
for comynlich whan wymmen ben mylde 
Þei ben swithe mylde, 
and whanne Þei ben crewel 
Þei ben swiþe cruel, and whan Þei ben schameles 
Þei ben to schameles. 
For whanne wymmen ben bolde to do foule dedes, 
Þei doun so foule dedes 
þat vnneÞe a man scholde be founde 
to do so foule dedes 
and be so schameles. 
Þei p i s þridde be ipreysed in good, 
ut in iuel it is to blamyng. 
For it is iknowe 
what is to preysyng in wymmen, 
it is to rekenyng 
what is to blamyng in hem. 
And we may sÞecialliche in wymmen 
fynde p r 
e þat ben to blamynge: 
first, for comonliche 
Þei ben vicious and folwen passions; 
Þe seconde, 
for Þei ianglen moche and stryuen and | col. chiden; 
Þe þridde, 
for Þei ben vnstedefast and vnstable. First, 
wymmen folwen passions 
whanne Þei mowe and ben intemporate, 
for in hem lackeþ resoun and hauen not whareby he scholde be withdrawe 
fro lust and likyng as a man 
h a p pat 
is more irewled by resoun. 
Þe seconde, 
wymmen ianglen and stryuen and chiden; 
and Þ a t is for Þe same cause, 
for comynlich resoun is not 
Þe brydel of a womman 
for comynliche hem lakken resoun. 
But schamefastnesse brideleth a womman more p a n resoun; 
and if wymmen ben conty[n]ent and iangleth not noþer stryuen noþer chiden, 
pat is more for schamefastnesse 
p a n for resoun. 
Wherfore whanne Þei ben imeued 
Þei conne not chaste hemself 
bote ianglen and chiden wiÞoute bridei, 
for we seen Þat wymmen ianglen and chiden lenger Þan men for Þei hauen lasse resoun þan men. 
Þe Þridde, 
wymmen ben vnstedefast and vnstable, 
and oon caas pat comeÞ of feble complexioun. 
For as it is iseid tofore comynliche Þe soule folweÞ Þe complexioun of Þe body. 
Þerfore as wymmen hauen nesche bodi and vnstable, 
so Þei ben nesche and vnstable in desire and in wil. Chapter X I X It is iseid tofore 
Þ a t wyues, children and seruantes 
scholde not be rewled 
by on manere rewlyng, 
for Þe housebonde scholde rewle his wif 
oÞer wise 
Þan his children oÞer seruantes. 
Bote for it is not inou to trete 
vnyuersaliche of rewelyng of wifes tellyng 
pat it is in anoþer manere rewlyng 
p a n rewlyng of children and of seruantes 
but it be treted sÞecialliche 
by what rewelyng wyues schulde be rewled, 
Þerfore it nedeþ to sÞeke in special som 
what of rewlyng of wyues. The G o v e r 
n a n c e of K 
i n g s a n d Princes Panne it | 
is to wetyng pat oon is a comyne rewle 
to al maner rewlyng; 
f. 
for who euere be pat wil reule eny thing wel moot haue special cautels 
to amende þe defautes of þ y 
n g þat schal be rewled. 
For as it fareth in spekyng, 
so it fareth in som wise in workes and dedes. 
For we seen pat some men ben parfit 
and renable of speche 
and som men stameren and boffen. 
And þei pat stameren and boffen [ben] not al in o wyse, 
for it is hardere to som men to speke oo word 
and for som to speke anober. 
And who pat wolde rewle stamerers and boffers in spekynge moste teche hem 
to take a special strif 
and special fondyng and afforsyng to speke 
Þe wordes pat p e i mowe worst speke. 
For we reden pat sum philosofres dede in Þe same wise, 
for Þei were ilette in þe tonge 
and ofte fondede to sowne 
Þe letters 
pat þei myte worste sowne 
and were so imaad parfit and renable of sÞeche. 
Panne in þis wise 
it most be in workes and dedes; 
for whanne a man knoweth þe defaute of hymself oþer of anober, 
if he wol rewle hymself oþer anober arit, 
he moot specialliche fonde 
to amende þe defautes 
in þe beste wise 
pat he can and in sum esy manere. 
Wherfore by cause pat wymmen, 
as it was iseid in þe nexte chapitre, 
comynliche ben intemporate, 
fol of iangelynge and vnstedefast and vnstable, 
he mot be rewled 
by suche rewlyng 
pat he be brout 
to be temporate, softe and stille, 
stedefast and stable. 
As it was iseid in þe firste book, 
þe partees of temporancia 
ben foure - chastite, honeste, abstinence and sobernesse. 
And wymmen ben temporate 
whanne þei ben chast, honest, abstinent and sobre. 
And wifes scholde be chast not oon|liche for to be trewe to here col. housbondes 
but also for conseyuyng 
and beryng of children. 
For if a wif ys not chast 
and trewe to here housebond, 
it may ligtliche happe pat anober child 
þan his owne schal be þe housebondes eyre. 
Pan it is semelich 
pat al citeseyns wifes be chast. 
And pat is more semlich 
for wyues of kynges and princes, 
for of here mysgetyng children 
may com more discord and strif. 
Þe ii, it is semlichpatwifes ben honest; 
for it is not inow for wyfes 
to be chast and kepe hemself 
fro vnlaweful workes and dedes, 
but þei moot also be pudic and honest 
for to be war of tokenes and of wordes 
pat semen mene to be vnhonest 
and is tokene berof. 
For it is not inow pat anober mannys child be not heire, 
but it nedeb pat þe fader be siker and certeyne 
of his owne childe. 
Panne for vnhonest tokenes and signes maken suspecioun of incontinent wyues, 
pat þe fader may be syker and certayn of his owne childe 
it is spedful pat 
wyues be honest. 
Þe þridde, 
wyues mot be abstinent, 
for to be waar of superfluyte of mete and of drynke 
is cause of incontinencia. 
Þe ferbe, wifes mot be sobre and war of to moche drynke. 
For superfluyte boþe of mete and of drynke 
is cause of lust 
and of likynge of lecherie. 
Þerfore in olde tyme 
among wymmen of Rome, 
as Valerius v B o o k II Parti Maximus seith, libro ii, capitulo De Institutis Antiquis, 
how it was not laweful to drynke wyne. 
Þerfore he seith pat vse of wyne was vnknowe to wymmen of Rome 
lest it scholde brynge hem to schame and velanye, 
for ofte vse of wyne was next to Þe most venus. 
Panne wyues scholde be so irewled 
pat Þei scholde be chast, honest, abstinent and sobre. 
And Þe manere by Þe whiche wyues scholde be ibrout to al Þese is dyuerse as housebondes 
ben diuerse 
in gentel­ lesse I and richesse. 
[For citeseyns pat ben lackyng 
in gentellesse and f. richesse] 
scholde by hemself informe and teche here 
wyues and vse Þew cauteles to make here wyues good in Þ e manere of goodnesse [as] 
it is iseid tofore. 
But riche men and lordes 
Þat ben gentile and hauen cyuyle myt and power scholde aspie wymmen of good fame 
and of good age, wise, 
and of good maners 
and Þewes to teche here 
wyues and brynge hem in by Þew monyciouns 
and techynge 
to be chaast, honest, and sobre, 
and to haue Þe goodnesse 
pat is irekened tofore. 
It is iknowe 
how wyues scholde be rewled 
to be temporate 
and it is to declaryng 
how Þey scholde be irewled 
to be soft and stille. 
For as it is iwrete, primo Poleticorum, 
ornament of wymmen is silens; 
for if wymmen hauen silens 
as Þei scholde, 
Þei semen Þevby 
Þe more ornate and ihiзt 
andÞe bettre iloued of here housebondes. 
Panne it is seme­ lich pat wyues be softe and stille; 
and also it is semelich 
þat Þei ben stedefast and stable, 
for Þe more stedefast and sad and stable 
a wif is Þe bettre a housebond troweþ 
pat he d o p as sche scholde. 
Panne by suche rewlenge wyues scholde be reuled to haue Þe 
for­ seyde sixe propretees and goodnesse pat Þei ben chaast, honest, stille, abstynent, sobre and stable. 
And to alle Þese Þe housebondes 
may brynge hem by hemself 
oÞer by wymmen of good loos and of good fame. 
Wherfore it is semelich 
pat alle cyteseyns rewle so here wyues; 
and Þe more Þerei may come to Þe regne of euel rewlyng of wyues of kynges and princes, 
Þe more semeliche it is pat 
Þei rewle so here wyues. Chapter X X [I]t is not inow to wite 
and to knowe 
how kynges and princes and generallich 
al citeseyns scholde rewle here wyues and to | what good­ col. 
nesse Þey scholde brynge here wyues 
but it be also iknowe how 
Þei scholde bere and haue hemself 
to here wyues. 
And as it longeth to p i s doyng, 
þre mote be knowe in 
Þe whiche housbondes 
scholde bere and haue hemself 
wel to here wyues. 
For firste, 
Þei scholde vse here 
wyues þewliche and moderatliche; 
Þe seconde, 
Þei scholde trete hem worschepfullich. 
Þe þridde, 
Þey scholde abyde wip hem in Þew tyme. 
Housebondes scholde vse here 
wyues moderatliche 
and wisliche 
for inmoderate and passyng vse of lecherie, first, destroyen Þe body; 
Þe T h e G 
o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s seconde, 
it bereth doun Þe soule; 
Þe Þridde, 
it defouleth appetit and talent 
and makeÞ wyues intemporate. 
Þe body of Þe housebonde is destroyed 
if Þei euen hem to moche to Þe doynge of wedloc, 
for Þe vertue of generacioun 
is to swythe corrupt; 
and as Þe philosofre meneþ iii Ethicorum, 
Þe apÞetite of suche lust and likyng 
may not haue ynow for comynliche 
a man desireth more þan kynde nedeþ. 
Panne if a man folwen Þe apÞetite of doynge of wedloc 
wiÞoute bridei of refraynyng, 
þanne he d o p more Þanne kynde nedeÞ and sÞendeÞ and wasteþ hymself in more p a n may be restored. 
And pat may not be wiÞoute feblyng of his owne body, 
for Þe brayn and siзt and Þeere lemes and membres ben ifebled and apayred 
by to greet vse of dede of wedloc. 
Þe seconde, 
to greet vse Þerof not oonliche febleþ 
Þe body 
but aÞeyreth and b e r e p doun Þe soule also. 
For Þe b o d y is Þe instrument of Þe soule; 
and as Þe hamer is instrument of Þe smyth, 
and if Þe hamer is febled and apayred, 
Þe | ‡smethes woork is aÞeyred. 
And so if Þe f. brayn 
and oÞere noble membris 
ben febled and apaired, 
Þe soule is ilette of Þe vse of resoun 
so pat he may not haue witte and knoweleche att Þe fulle. 
Þerfore it is preued tofore 
by auctorite of Þe philosofer 
pat suche passynge 
and ouer doyng smyteÞ Þe resoun. 
Þe Þridde, 
suche doynge to moche ivsed defouleÞ 
Þe apÞetite 
and makeÞ wymmen intemporate; 
for the more Þey vsen lecherie, 
Þe more apÞetite is excited to Þe d e d e of lecherie, 
asÞe philosofer 
m e n e p , 
[v]ii Ethicorum. 
And Þerfore Þe lewed mevyng a m e n e þ of som men is ipreued lewed: 
Þei menen pat Þey now wollen do Þe d e d e of lust and likynge 
and absteyne ham afterward. 
For eche vse of suche fleschliche likynge exciten to vse it more afterward; 
and Þe more a Þersone v s e p it, 
Þe more he is excited 
to vse suche a dede 
and is alwey 
Þe more intemporate and more. 
Panne it is semelich pat alle citeseyns vse moderatliche 
Þe flesch­ liche doyng of wedloc. 
And Þe more vnsemeliche it is pat kynges and princes be aÞeyred in body 
by suche doynge and haue Þe soule aÞeyred 
and Þe apÞetite intemporate, 
Þe more semelich it is pat Þei vse suche doynge temporatliche. 
And it is not inow for hem 
to vse suche doynge moderatliche 
but Þei vse it also wisliche and redyliche. 
For in alle workes and dedes 
mot be wisdom and redinesse so pat it b e doun 
in Þewe tyme 
and in couenable place and manere. 
For som tyme soche doyng moot bee spared, 
for in tyme of bedes and of prayers 
suche doyng scholde be spared; 
and also whanne harme and greef scholde come 
of suche doynge, 
suche doyng | scholde be spared. 
Panne it most col. be do 
in Þew tyme 
and in couenable place 
and in conuenient manere, 
for bytwene housebonde 
and wyf scholde 
not be onlich likynge 
frend­ schiÞe 
but also honest frendschiÞe. 
v B o o k II Parti 
For it is iknowe how housebondes scholde moderatliche vse here 
wyues and rediliche, 
it is to declarynge how Þei scholde trete here 
wyues honestliche. 
For by Þe staat and faculte of richesse eche housebond scholde araye his wif 
and fynde here 
whaat here 
n e d e p . 
For Þe wif is a Þersone faste iioyned to Þe housebonde, 
and Þerfore whaat is worscheÞe to Þe wif 
is worschep to Þe housebonde. 
And for it is declared tofore þat wif 
is not to Þe housebonde 
as his seruant 
but as is his felawe, 
eche housebonde scholde trete and araye his owne wyf after his owne estate. 
For it is declared how housebondes scholde moderatliche, wisliche, and rediliche vse here 
wyues 
and how Þei scholde trete hem worschepliche, 
it is to declarynge 
whaat conuersacioun housebondes 
scholde haue to here wyues. 
And housebondes hauen good conuersacioun with here 
wyues if Þey schewen to hem tokenes of loue and of frendschiÞe 
and if Þei taken hem 
by good informacioun and loore. 
And Þewe signes and tokenes 
and frendschiÞe 
and couenable informacioun and lore 
may not be declared 
but [by] takynge hede of dyuerse states and condiciouns of Þersones. 
For Þe housebonde scholde besiliche take hede wheÞer here 
wyues ben prouteo 
Þ e rmeke and wheÞer Þey ben wyse oÞer foles. 
For housebondes scholde haue such conuersacioun 
with here wifes so pat Þei schulde schewe mo tokenes of loue to hem 
þat ben meke p a n to hem pat ben proute; 
| for proute wyues ben so f. stoute of herte pat if Þe housebonde schewe to hem many tokenes of loue, 
Þey wollen fonde to be here housebondes maistres and ladies. 
Also housebondes schulde haue suche conuersacioun 
with here wifes 
pat wise wyues and foles scholde be dyuersliche enformed and itaugt. 
For wise wyues wol be taugt and corrected 
by faire wordes and plesynge, 
but wyues pat b e e 
n fooles mot be more scharpliche iblamed. þanne alle housebondes 
scholde take heede to here owne estaate and of condiciouns of Þersones 
and schewe to here wyues Þew tokenes of frendschiÞe 
and of loue and teche hem 
by Þew warnynges and loore. Chapter XXI Kynges and princes and generalliche alle citeseyns scholde wete and iknowe 
how Þei scholde araye here wyues. 
For Þe housebond scholde rewle Þe wif and brynge here 
to honeste workes and vertues, 
it is sÞedful pat alle housebondes take hede wherinne wymmen trespassen comynliche and take heede and knowe 
what is laweful and vnlawefulle. 
And for comynliche wymmen desiren most to be holde faire and trespasseth sÞecialiche desyrynge and louynge 
to be gayliche arayed, 
wherfore housebondes 
scholde knowe what aray of wymmen is leeful r The G o v e r 
n a n c e of Kings 
a n d Princes 
and what araye is vnlefful. 
For wymmen ben neuere vertuous 
but Þei forsake and leue vnlefful doyng and, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
þe philosofer declareth how greet harm falled to regne and to citee by wymmen 
þat ben not vertuous 
nÞeer louen leefful doynge but vnlefful. 
And he sÞekeþ of Þe Lacedemonyes, 
men of Þe lond pat | hatte Lacedemonia, col. and seith Þat Þei ben vngracious in Þe haluendele for Þei soffren þeire wyues do vnlufful doyng. 
Panne for þe hous of a prince 
o Þ e r of a citeseyn scholde not be vngracious in Þe haluendele 
nÞeer in oÞer wyse, princes and citeseyns scholde rewle here 
wyues in araye 
and chaste hem 
in alle doyng 
in Þe whiche wymmen trespassen ofte. 
Panne it is to wetynge 
as it longeÞ herto pat wymmen araye stondeþ in tweyne, 
for som araye is ifeyned 
and som is verrey in dede. 
And feynyng araye is smeryng oÞer 
bawmyng 
wip white colour oÞer w i p rede by Þe whiche feynyng 
wymmen semen more whit oÞer more rody [oÞer] in sum wyse more faire p a n Þei ben in dede. 
And for suche araye is ifeyned, 
it is vnleufful and forbode. 
Þe oÞer araye is not ifeyned 
but it stondeþ in Þewe ornamentes of araye 
and if wymmen ben 
ÞerwyÞ arayed semelich 
as here astaat axeth þanne 
it is lefful and honest. 
And housebondes scholde araye here 
wyues as here astaat axen in cloÞyng and Þeere ornamentes. 
Þerfore Valerius Maximus preyseþ 
Þe Romayns for Þei arayen here 
wyues in fayre clothynge and in oÞere ornamentes. 
Panne so it scholde be of ornament and araye. 
But for to teche wyues more sÞecialliche how Þei scholde be arayed 
in cloÞynge 
and in Þeere ornamentes, 
it is to wetynge pat 
in clÞeynge wymmen may trespace in twey 
wise:first,in takynge more þanne inow, 
Þe seconde by lacke and defaute. 
For to putte of more p a n inow it | 
nedeÞ to haue Þ r e vertues Þe f. 
whiche ben itouched by Andronycus Þeripateticus 
in his book 
Þ a t he makeÞ of vertues. 
And p i s pre vertues 
ben icleÞed humilitas, moderancia and symplicitas: mekenesse, moderatnesse and semplenesse. 
And wymmen ben meke in araie whanne Þei arayen hemself semliche and wel 
and not for prude and veyn glorie 
but for to plese here housebondes 
and for to wiÞdrawe hem fro fornicacioun. 
And Þei ben moderate 
whan Þei taken heede 
to here owne astaat and axeth not to greet araye. 
For a knytes wif scholde be betere arayed þanne 
a symple citeseynes wif 
and a kynges wif oÞer a princes 
wif scholde be better arayed 
Þanne oþere symplere wyues. 
Also if eny mannes 
wif were meke 
and arayed not for veyn glorye, git he myt trespase in araye 
if schue were not moderat 
but arayed passyng here owne astaat. 
Þe Þridde, 
wymmen scholde be symple in araye so 
Þat Þei scholde not be to besy 
to haue greet araye. 
For Þei a womman be not arayed 
for veyne glorie 
nÞeer passynge here owne estaat, 
ut sche may trespasse 
if sche is to besy 
v B o o k II Parti aboute here owne array. 
Panne in Þre manere wise 
may be suÞerfluyte of aray. 
In tweyne may be trespace, 
wherfore, 
in defaute and lacke. First, 
if it is for sleuthe and necligence, 
for sum wymmen ben so slowe and reccheles 
Þat onliche for necgligence 
Þey leeuen to araye hemself to be preysed 
for suche lacke and defaute. 
For som tyme som man 
is prout of wrecchednesse 
Þat he suffreþ. | 
For as it fareth in lame men col. 
and seeke 
Þat ben at cherche dores, 
comynliche he Þat is most lame 
oÞer sike is best apaied; 
for he troweth pat most men 
wol loke on hym and hoÞeth 
to haue most almesse and iftes. 
So sum tyme he pat 
is worst arayed in clÞeynge 
is most prout 
for Þei trowen to be preysed Þerfore. 
Panne wymmen trespassen if Þei ben proute of euel araye 
and defaute of clÞeynge. 
Þerfore, iiii Ethicorum, 
Þe philosofer blameþ 
Þe Lathanies suche men for Þei were cloþed worst 
Þan here astaat axede 
and were stoute and proute Þerfore. 
Panne wyues scholde be so reweled in araye so 
Þat Þei b e besiliche itaugt to knowe Þe sixe 
Þat ben itouched. 
For firste, 
Þei scholde be iwarned 
and icharged 
to vse no feynedaraye. 
Þe seconde, 
to be humyle and meke 
Þat Þei b 
e not passynglich arayed for euel noþer for veyn glorye. 
Þe Þridde, pat Þey ben moderat pat Þey b e not arayed passyng here owne astaat. 
Þe ferÞe, 
pat Þei ben symple 
and not trauele 
to besiliche aboute here awne aray. 
Þe fifÞe, 
Þat Þey b e not necligent 
nÞeer notabliche for slouthe arayed worse 
Þan here astaat axeth. 
Þe sixte, 
Þat Þei ben not prout neiþer desire 
to be preysed for euel 
and for wrecchede araye 
and for defaute of clothing. Chapter XXII 
Manye men trespassen forÞei ben to gelous of here wyues. 
And pat to grete gelosie 
is not to preysyng 
may be preued by p r e menes. 
For whanne a man 
is to gelous of his wif, 
for greet gelousye he supposeth and troweth of his wif alwey Þe worst. 
For ofte good wyues and trewe ben iblamed of | here housebondes 
if Þe housebondes ben to gelous, 
f. for ofte of good dedes gelouse men supposen Þe worste. 
Of to greet gelousie comeþ 
Þre harmes by Þe whiche p r e resons may be take byÞe First, 
for Þei ben trauaylled and disturbled in hemself. 
Þe seconde, 
for Þerfore wyues ben excited to do amys. 
Þe Þridde, 
for comonliche of suche gelousi comeþ strif and wreche in hous. 
Þe firste mene is declared in p i s wise. 
For if housebondes ben to gelous of here 
owne wyues 
[asifÞei]ben alwey susÞecte to Þe housebondes, 
and so alwey housebondes and wyues ben in angwysch and wo of herte, 
and for on besynesse 
letteÞ anoÞer,

n a n c e o f K i n g s a n d Pr i n c e s ben wiÞdrawe 
fro Þew besynesse 
and civel workes and dedes. 
Panne non citeseyns schulde be ielouse of here wyues. 
And [pis] is more seme­ lich for kynges and princes 
in so moche as more harme may come to Þe regne 
[i]f kynges ben in angwysch and wo of hert 
and ben wiþ­ drawe 
fro cyuel doynges 
and Þew besynesse of Þe regne. 
Þe seconde mene to preue 
Þe same is itake 
for Þerby wyues ben excited to do amys 
if here housebondes ben to gelous. 
For comon­ liche and alwey 
forbedyng makeÞ lust and likyng Þe more; 
for as it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
lust and likyng is to þyng pat is not ihad. 
Þerfore it is ipreued Þer e pat oolde men desiren more to lyue Þe laste day 
þan al Þe dayes tofore honde, 
for þanne Þei hauen more lakke of lif. 
Pan alwey þyng pat lackeþ 
and failleÞe isÞe more desired. 
But whanne a thing is forbode, 
for it is forbode, 
it semeÞ pat it lackeÞ 
and failleþ 
and is Þer|fore Þe more desired. 
Panne it folweth pat gelous men wyues col. 
ben more excited to do amys 
p a n oÞer e men wyues, 
for here lust and desire is Þe more 
by cause of Þe inordynate gelousie of Þe house­ bondes 
and of here inordenate forbedyng. 
Þe Þridde mene is itake by wrake and stryf 
Þat is in hous for gel­ ousye. 
For whan wyues seen 
Þat Þei ben ichydde and iblamed giltles 
and pat here housebondes 
hauen euel susÞecioun of hem withoute cause, 
Þanne Þe wyues 
may not pacientliche soffre 
Þe wronge pat here gelous housebondes 
beren hem an honde. 
Þerfore comynliche in pat hous is chydyng and strif. 
Panne it is nout semeliche pat housebondes 
be to gelous of here wyues. 
NÞeer it is semeliche pat wyues haue ward and kepyng ordeyn­ ed by Þe housebondes. 
Noþer it is semelich 
Þat housebondes ben gelous, 
but Þei schulde take heede of condiciouns of Þersones 
and of vsage and manere of Þe contray, 
and eche housebonde schal be 
Þewe­ liche besy and redyliche rewle his owne wif. 
And so it is semelich 
pat eche housebonde loue ordinatliche his own wif 
so pat bytwene hem be kynde frendschiÞe 
and loue likynge and honest. Chapter XXIII 
Wymmen counsaile is feble 
as it is iseid, 
primo Poleticorum. 
For as a child hap vnparfit counsaille 
for he faileth of Þerfeccioun of man, 
so a womman hap feble counsaile for Þei ben feble of complexioun 
and faillen of Þe strengþe of man. 
And Þeiз sum wymmen ben houge of body and strong Þat is not for good complexioun 
but for nesch flesch and tendre. 
For wymmen nesch flesch and tendre 
is more euydens of I moche flewme þanne of good compleccioun. 
Wherfore it is so, 
f. wymmen mote faille of Þe vse of resoun 
and haue feble counsaille. 
For Þe beter complexioun 
is in Þe body, 
Þe more Þe b o d 
y is proporcionate to Þe soule and serueþ 
Þerfore Þe soule Þe bettre. 
And Þe soule 
Þat v B o o k II Parti ┌is┐┌insuche┐a body vseth his owne workes 
Þe more freliche 
and h a p vse of resoun 
Þe more sÞedliche. 
Panne first, 
it is to wetyng 
Þat wymmen counsaille is feble. 
Þe seconde, 
it is to wetynge 
Þat wymmen counsaile 
is swift 
and sone igeue. 
For as Þe philosofer seith, 
in libro De Animalibus, 
al pat is vnparfit 
c o m e þ sone to complement. 
[ P a n n e w y m m e n c o u n s a i l e , 
f o r i t i s f e b l e re p a n m a n n e s c o u n s a i l e , 
comeþ s o n e t o c o m p l e m e n t ] Panne if oÞere thinges stondeÞ euene, 
if a man scholde anoon do a dede and mygt nougt haue ful avisement to do pat dede, 
wymmen counsaille 
were betere þanne men counsaile. 
For kynde is imeued by angels 
and by God 
in wham is most prudencia and wisedom, 
kynde moot wyrche ordinatliche and redyliche for he pat is prudens, wise, and redy sÞedeþ hym sone 
and taryeth not moche 
in foule thynges of Þe whiche is litel forse. 
Þerfore it is iseid 
in a prouerbe 
Þat an euel herbe groweþ swythe sone, 
for kynde reccheþ luyte þerof 
and bryngeÞ it sone 
to fol wex­ inge. 
And so a womman haþ rather Þerfeccioun of body Þan a man. 
Wherfore by cause Þat Þe soule folweþ 
Þe complexioun of Þe body, 
so a womman bodi, 
for it is more vile 
and kynde reccheÞ lasse Þer of, 
comeþ sonnere to complement Þanne mannes body. 
And so womman counsaile is sonnere parfit 
and ful igeue þanne mannes counsaile. | col. 
Panne symÞelliche withoute condicioun menne counsaille 
is betere þanne wymmen counsaille for men ben more parfit 
Þanne wymmen and wymmen counsaile is feble. 
But in caas wymmen consaile 
is bettere þanne menne counsaile, 
for it is sonnere igeue at fulle. 
if it nedeÞ to do 
in som hasty nede wiÞOute longe tyme of avisement, 
on caas wymmen counsaille is best. Chapter X X I V 
By þre menes we may preue pat comynliche wymmen 
may not hele consaille. 
Þe firste mene is itake 
by defaute of resoun; Þe secounde, 
by nesche herte; 
Þe þridde, 
by desire of preysyng. 
Þe firste mene is declared in Þ Ì S wise. 
For as it is iseide tofore, 
if a dede is forbode, 
here desire is þe more to do suche a dede. 
And whanne a þyng is itold in consaile, 
it is forbode 
pat it not be itold out. 
And be Þat forbeding, 
Þe apÞetite and Þ e desire is more ex[c]ite to telle 
on cas out counsayle þanne o Þ e r þingis. 
But Þe appetit and desire 
be refrainid bi resun, 
wommen mowe not conabliche hold counsayle. 
Panne for wymmen lacken vse of resoun and mowe not refrayne apÞe­ tite and desire 
as men mowe, 
a ‡ tellen Þerfore sonere p a n men and discoueren counsaile. 
For forbedyng makeÞ apÞetite and desire Þe more, 
and wymmen ben more inclyned p a n men to doo amys and agenst forbedyng forÞei hauen more defaute of reson p a n men and T h e G o v e r 
n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s mow worse refrayne þyng Þat exciteÞ 
apÞetite and desire þanne men mowe. 
Þe seconde mene to preue 
Þe same is itake by nesche herte. 
For comynliche wymmen 
ben nesche of herte and sone ouercome. 
And whanne a Þersone preyseþ hem 
and laugheth on hem, 
thei trowen 
Þat he is a frend 
and telleþ hym al Þe preue |te of here herte. 
f. Þe Þridde mene to preue 
Þe same is itake 
by desire of preysynge. 
For it is iseid tofore 
Þat comynliche wymmen desiren to be preysed; 
and Þerfore comynliche wymmen teilen 
al here counsaille to Þeere wymmen 
Þe whiche Þei holden here frendschiÞe, 
and trowenÞerby to be excellent and ipreysed of oÞere wymmen 
if Þei teilen to hem 
Þe counsaille of here housebondes. 
For it semeþ pat here housebondes 
louen hem if Þei knowen here counsaille. 
And suche wyues hauen veyn glorie to be preysed. 
And so it is declared 
how men scholde telle here counsaylle 
to here owne wyues. 
And whanne we teilen whiche ben Þe maners 
of children 
and of olde men, 
it schal not be vnderstonde pat children 
and olde men 
mot nede vse suche maneres, 
but onliche Þat comynliche manye vsen maners 
by a manere inclinacioun. 
But children, oolde men and wymmen mowe, 
if Þei wollen, 
by vse of resoun J, 
be stedefast and constant and ouercome suche inclinacioun. 
For Þei it be hard to ouercome inclynacioun of apÞetite and desire, 
and Þeig it be more hard in wymmen 
Þan in men for Þey 
ben more defaute 
of vse of resoun, 
naþelees it is not inpossible. 
For boÞe men and wymmen mowe 
ouercome suche reses and inclinaciouns. 
Wherfore Þei comynliche wymmen telle out counsaille, 
gut it is not inconuenient 
Þei sum wymmen holde wel counsaile. 
Panne men scholde not telle here counsaille 
to here owne wyues but Þei knowe by assaye of longe tyme pat here wyues ben preuey, wise and redy, 
stedefast and stable and pat Þei | wol not wrye and telle out col. preuey counsaille. 
For Þes ben iknowe whanne 
it is declared how Þe comyntee of housebonde 
and wyf is kyndelich 
and how it is iordeyned 
to Þeere comyntees of hous, 
and for it is declared how kynges and princes and generaliche alle citeseyns scholde haue hemself 
to here owne wyues 
and what maner conuersacioun 
Þei scholde haue 
with here owne wifes, 
Þe ende is imaad of Þe firste part of Þe secunde n Þe which partie 
it is itreted of rewelynge and of wedloc. 
But oon caas som man wolde wene 
pat it is not itreted 
at Þe folle of rewlyng of wedloc 
for it is not declared to whaat workes wyues ben iordeyned, 
for it is vnsemelich 
Þat wyues ben idel 
as it is iseid 
tofore honde, 
þanne workes pat wyues schulde vse schulde be discreued. 
But Þerof we schal sÞeke here after; 
Þerfore here me passeþ wiþ scilence. 
r I Part II 
That fadere and moder scholde be besy 
aboute here owne children. 
That it is most semelich pat kynges and princes be besy 
aboute here owne children 
it is preued in þr e manere wise. 
The rewelyng of children comeÞ of loue and children scholde be r oÞe wyse irewled þan seruantes.

Þat Þey cunne here byleue in childhod. ‡ | ‡ f. v Alle citeseyns and namelich kynges and princes scholde be besy to rewle here children

How alle citeseyns and nameliche kynges and princes scholde be besy to rewle here

Kynges and princes and generalliche alle citeseyns scholde teche here doutres to be softe and stille and not vse grete iangelyng. Chapter I 
For Þe firste partie of p i s seconde s isÞed in Þe whiche partie 
it is itreted of Þe rewlyng of wedloc, 
now it is to wetyng of Þe seconde partie 
in Þe whiche it schal be treted of rewlyng of children. 
For it is not inow to an housebonde to cunne rewle his wif 
but he kunne also gouerne 
and rewle his children arit. 
Panne it is to wetyng pat comynte of housebonde and wif, 
of lord and seruaunt, 
longeÞ to Þe firste hous 
and comynte of fader and sone longeþ to a parfit hous. 
Þerfore on caas som man wolde wene 
þat anon 
after tretynge of rewlyng of wedloc 
it were to tretyng of rewlyng of seruantes. 
But as Þe philosofer seith, primo Poleticorum, 
an housebonde is more besy aboute men 
þanne aboute sowles possessioun 
and aboute his children 
[p]an aboute his seruantes. 
Þerfore we wolde raÞer trete of rewlyng of children 
þanne rewlyng of seruauntes, 
for in rewelyng of children 
scholde be more charge and besynesse þanne in rewelyng of seruantes. 
And in tretyng of rewelyng of children 
we wol first declare pat alle fadres scholde be besy aboute here owne children. 
if Þe besynesse is iknowe Þat scholde be aboute children, 
Þe fadres ben Þe more excited to rewle wel | here children. 
And by p r e menes we may f. 
preue pat fadres and modres schulde haue suche besynesse. 
Þe f[irst]e mene is itake 
for fadres ben cause of Þe children 
and children comen r B o o k II 
and hauen beyng of Þe fadres. 
Þe seconde, 
for Þe fadres ben aboue Þe children 
and kunneþ more good Þanne Þei. 
And Þe Þridde, 
for bytwene fadres and children 
scholde be kynde frendschiÞe and loue. Þe firste mene is declared in p i s wise. 
For as we seen in kyndelich thinges 
pat kynde eueÞ neuere beyng to a thing 
but kynde be busy aboute thinges 
by Þe whiche pat þyng 
may be kepte and isaued in beynge, 
as┌if┐[kynde]┌зeu‡eth┐‡beynge to fuyre, 
anon kynde is besy to eue 
Þerto litnesse 
by Þe whiche it may be bore vpward, 
[for] fuyre is better ikepte 
and isaued aboue þanne byneþe: 
and so whan kynde eueþ beyng to beestes, 
for a beeste may not be saued wiÞoute mete, 
anoon kynde is besy to eue mowÞes to beestes and oÞer e lymes by Þe whiche Þei mowe take mete and norischyng. 
Panne for Þe fadres 
ben cause of Þe children 
and Þe children 
hauen kyndelich beyng of Þe fadres, 
Þe fadres scholde haue charge of Þe children 
and be besy aboute hem 
to fynde hem 
liflode and thinges pat hem neden to keÞe and saue hem in beynge. 
Þe seconde mene to preue 
Þe same is itake for Þe fadres ben aboue Þe children 
and kunneÞ more good Þan Þey. 
For alwey by kynde 
o[u]ere thinges euen influence 
and vertue to Þe [ne]þer 
and rewleÞ and saueÞ hem. 
And we seen Þat sterres and pianettes of heuene eueþ influence and vertue | to Þese 
neÞer <thinges> 
and rewleth and saueth col. hem. 
Panne for it is kyndeliche pat 
Þe ouere thinges eue influence and vertue 
to Þe nethere 
and rewle hem and saue, 
eche lord and souer­ 
eyn scholde be besy how Þey scholde {Þewliche helÞe and sokere his sogettes 
and rewle hem and saue. 
And so God hymself pat is aboue 
al h a p besynesse, prudencia, wisdom and rewlynge of al Þe world. 
Panne for Þe fadres ben kyndelich aboue Þe children, 
Þei scholde be besy aboute here rewlyng. 
Þe þridde mene is itake 
by kynde frendschiÞe and loue pat is b y twene fadres and children. 
For by resoun of loue 
he pat louen scholde be besy aboute þyng pat he loueÞ, 
for eche man is besy aboute hym pat h e loueth. 
Panne for bytwene fader and sone is kynde loue 
as it is ipreued, 
viii Ethicorum, 
by cause of kynde loue 
þat is bytwene fadres and children, 
fadres schulde be besy aboute here children. Chapter II 
They alle fadres scholde be besy aboute here owne children 
as it is ipreued 
by Þe forseide resons, it it is most semelich pat kynges and princes haue suche besynesse and Þat we may preue 
by Þre menes: 
Þe firste is itake 
by wit and kunnyng of hem; 
Þe seconde, 
by goodnesse of Þe children; 
Þe Þridde, 
by profit of Þe regne. 
Þe firste mene is declared in p i s wise. 
For in libro De Animalibus 
Þe philosofer seith pat of beestes 
Þat what is best iknowe h a p most T h e G o v e r 
n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s besynesse, 
and he pat knoweÞ best is most besy | aboute his children; 
f. for it is kyndelich 
Þat eche loue his owne workes 
as Þe philosofer meneÞ [in] Ethic[is]. 
Þerfore Þe fadres louen kyndeliche here owne children and poetes 
louen here owne poesees 
as here owne werkes. 
Panne Þe more cunnynge and wytty oon is 
and Þe better he knoweÞ his owne werk, 
Þe more besy a is 
Þeraboute he loueþ it Þe bettre. 
Panne Þe more kunnynge and wise Þe fadres ben, 
Þe more besy he scholde be aboute here owne children. 
But it is ipreued 
Þat kynges and princes and generalliche alle lordes 
mot be redy, cunnyng, and wise if Þei scholde be lordes by kynde. 
Panne Þe more witty, wise, 
and redy Þei ben, 
Þe kynges and princes scholde be more besy 
aboute here owne children passynge oÞere men. 
Þe seconde mene is itake 
by goodnesse of children. 
For children of kynges and princes scholde be bettre 
and more good p 
a n oÞer e children 
as Þe philosofer 
m e n e p , iii Polethicorum, 
and seith pat as men ben in grettere staat 
and in more dignite, 
so he scholde be Þe more good 
and Þe more parfit 
in cunnyng and in vertues. 
For who pat rewleth Þeere ‡men scholde be wise 
so and redy and so good 
Þat oÞere men 
myзte take of hem ensample of leuyng. 
And Þeiз not al children of kynges and princes 
be kynges and princes, 
зit for thei ben 
al in som principate 
and in som lordschiÞe 
in the whiche hee mot rewle oÞere men, 
he scholde be wise and redy and good. 
But for children ben Þe bettre and Þe more wise, 
redy and good if Þe fadres ben besy aboute hem, 
Þe more wise and redy and good heere children scholde I ‡be, 
kynges and princes scholde be 
Þe more besy aboute col. 
here owne children. 
Þe Þridde mene to preue 
Þe same is itake by profit of Þe regne. 
For goodnesse of Þe regne 
is deÞendant of Þe goodnesse of hem 
pat ben in Þe regne 
and namliche of goodnesse of princes pat ben þerinne. 
For as hele of kyndelich body 
is deÞendant of heele of al Þe membris, 
and namliche of heele of Þe herte 
and of Þe principal membris 
for Þe herte and principaliche membris geuen influence and vertue to oÞer 
e membris and rewleÞ hem, 
so goodnesse of Þe regne 
is deÞendant of goodnesse 
of alle citeseyns 
and nameliche of goodnesse of princes and lordes pat ben i n Þ e regne. 
It is profit to eche regne 
to haue good citeseyns, 
but it is more profit to haue good princes, 
for princes scholde rewle oÞere men. 
Panne Þe more profit comeþ to Þe regne of good­ nesse of children of kynges 
pat scholde haue principate 
and lordschiÞe 
in Þe regne passynge Þe profit 
Þat comeþ of goodnesse 
and of wit and wisdome of oÞer e children, 
Þe more semelich it is þat kynges and princes be besy aboute here owne children 
to make hem wise and redy and good. 
v B o o k II Chapter III 
For after þe tretes of rewelyng of wedloc 
it is to tretyng of rewelyng of children, 
it is to wetyng wherof Þe ordre and rewelyng of children springeÞe 
and by what reweling children scholde be rewled. 
Panne it is to wetyng þat Þer is Þre manere of rewlyng 
for eche man pat rewleÞ 
o Þ e r e men: | o Þ e r a r e w l e Þ hem by certeyn lawes and couenantes, 
and f. r suche rewelyng 
is icleÞed politicumo Þ e rcyuel, 
as it is iseid tofore; 
oÞer he r e w l e p hym freliche 
by his owne wille, 
and þat may be in twey maner wise. 
For he Þat rewleth so d 
o p it ‡for his owne profit, 
and þanne Þe rewlyng 
is icleÞed regymen despoticum 
oÞer ceruyle; 
o Þ e r he pat rewleth d 
o p it for profit of Þe sogettes, 
and suche rewelyng 
is icleÞed regale, real, 
pat is a real kyngdome. 
And to Þes Þ r e manere of rewlyng 
by Þe whiche we seen men rewle citees, casteles, and townes ben ilikned Þre maners of rewlyng 
Þat ben in oon hous. 
For Þe rewlyng of wedloc 
is ilikned to Þe rewelyng 
þat hatte poleticum, 
for as it is iseid tofore a man schal not be aboue his wif rewelyng 
by his owne lust and likynge 
but as Þe lawes of wedloc axeth 
and Þewe couenantes 
pat ben imaad 
bytwene housebonde and wif. 
And Þe rewelynge of children is ilikned to Þe rewelyng real, 
for Þe fader is aboue Þe children 
not by couenantes and foreward 
but by his fre wille. 
For bytwene Þe sogette and Þe souereyne 
is no couenant imaad 
but Þ e sogette may chese hym a souereyne, 
so bytwene Þe fader 
and Þe children 
is non couenant imaad 
but Þe children 
myзt chese hem a fader. 
But Þe children comen kyndeliche of fader 
and of moder 
and chesen not a fader 
as wyues chesen housebondes. 
Panne for rewl­ yng of children 
is by fre | wil of Þe fader 
and for here owne good and col. profit, 
suche rewelyng is not ilekned to Þe rewlyng 
pat hatte poleticum 
but to Þe rewelyng real. 
And primo Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer s e i p pat Þe housebonde 
is aboue Þe wif and Þe children, 
aboue hem Þat ben free, 
and not in Þ 
e same manere of principate; 
but he is aboueÞe wif 
by politik rewelyng, 
and aboue Þe children 
by real rewlyng. 
And Þe Þridde rewelyng 
Þat is in an hous 
by Þe whiche rewlyng manye is irewled is ilikned to Þe rewlyng 
pat hatte dominatiuum, 
lordlich rewelyng. 
Now Þ I S is declared it semeÞ 
Þat it is ful sooÞ pat was iseid in Þe bygynnyng of Þe chapitre. 
For if Þe fader scholde be aboue children realiche and for here owne good and profite, 
for it is al oon to loue a man 
and to wille hym good, 
Þe fader scholde be aboue Þe children 
for here owne good and profit 
and for he wol hem good. 
Panne it is iknowe clerliche 
Þat suche rewlyng comeþ of loue. 
Panne it is opounliche declared 
Þat children and seruantes 
scholde not be o rewled 
by on manere rewlyng, 
for a lord is aboue his seruantes 
for his owne good and profit. 
And Þe philosofer meneÞ pat it is al on to be aboue oÞere 
as aboue his seruantes 
for his owne good and profit 
and The G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d Princes 
not for here good and profit, 
but Þe fadir schuld be aboue is childrin 
for here good and profite. 
Panne by Þe distyncioun of maners of rewlyng 
it is declared pat rewlyng of children 
and of seruantes 
is not al oon 
but Þe rewlynge of children cometh of loue; 
and for to sÞeke more clerlich we may preue be twey weyes 
pat rewlyng of children cometh of 
loue.Þefirstewey is itake [by ordre of kynde; 
Þe seconde by Þerfeccioun of Þe fader. 
Þe firste mene is declared] 
in Þ I S | wyse. 
For Þe philosofer m e n e þ Þat f. kynde geueÞ 
Þe vertue of generacioun 
for thinges 
pat may not be ÞerÞetual 
in hemself scholde be ÞerÞetual 
in som thinges ilecheÞerto. 
Wherfore if rewlyng of children 
comeþ of loue 
and for Þe child is kyndelyche 
a certeyne liknesse 
and comeþ of Þe fader, 
for by kynde þynges Þ a t ben iliche loueÞ eche oÞer, 
we may argue by kynde ordre 
Þ a t rewlyng of children 
is igrounded in loue and c o m e p of loue. 
For as in alle thinges is kynde inclinacioun to gendre and brynge forÞ suche anÞeer 
and to gendre and to gete children, 
so in hem is kynde inclinacioun 
to loue here children 
and to rewle hem 
and to be besy aboute hem. 
Panne kynde ordre 
is so pat rewlyng and besynesse aboute children 
comeþ of loue. 
Þe seconde wey to preue 
Þe same is itake by Þerfeccioun of Þe fader. For Þe philosofer 
m e n e p þat eche thing is parfit whanne it may gendre and brynge forÞ suche anoÞer. 
Panne for eche man loueÞ kyndelich his owne Þerfeccioun, 
Þe fader l o u e Þ kyndelich his childe 
for Þe child 
is as Þei it were witnesse of Þe faders Þerfeccioun. 
Panne for Þe fader hap kynde loue to his child, 
he is excited by loue 
to rewle Þe child; 
and it were not so 
but rewlyng of children 
comeþ of loue. 
It is iknow pat rewlyng of children comeÞ of loue 
and pat Þe fader scholde be aboue Þe children 
for here owne good and profit, 
and pat rewlyng of children 
comeþ of loue 
and he pat loueþ 
is alwey besy aboute Þe Þersone 
pat h e loueþ 
and for his profit. 
Panne children and seruantes 
scholde not be rewled 
by oon manere rewlyng, 
for he Þat [rewleÞ hem] 
is aboue | his seruantes, 
for Þei ben seruantes 
pat desiren col. 
his owne good and profit. 
And if it hapÞeÞ 
Þat a man v s e p his children as seruantes, 
pat is for inÞerfeccioun of his hous; 
for on caas he is so pore Þat he may not haue seruantes inow. 
Þerfore, vi Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer seiþ pat nedy men mote vse here 
wyues and children 
in stede of seruantes. 
v Chapter IV 
It was iseid in Þe nexte chapitre 
pat rewlyng of children comeþ of loue. 
Panne it is to wetynge 
how moche fadres louen 
Þe children and children Þe fadres 
Þat we may knowe how fadres scholde rewle here 
B o o k II children and children be obedient to Þe fadres. 
viii Ethicorum, 
Þe philos­ ofer seith 
Þat we may preue by p re resons pat fadres and modres louen here children more p a n agenward. 
Þe firste resoun is itake 
by lengthe of time. 
Þe ii, 
bi swirte and sikirnesse of childrin. 
Þe iii, 
bi onyng of fadris and modris to Þe childryn. 
Þe firste wey is declared in p i s wise. 
For Þe lengere loue d u r e Þ , 
Þe strengere it is; 
and faders and moders louep 
Þe children lengere tyme p 
a n children louen fadres and modres, 
for anon as children ben ibore fadres and moders louen hem. 
And children louen not fadres and modres anoon as Þ e i ben ibore, 
for Þei ben not so wisepatÞeyknowen what is to louynge bot for children anoon as Þey ben ibore kunneb not knowe 
bytwene fader and moder and oþer men and wymmen pat loueþ hem not anoon. 
But by passyng of tyme, 
whanne Þey knowen betwene fader 
and moder and obere, 
þanne he bygynneb to loue hem. 
Panne faderes and moders louen þe children long |gere tyme þan agen­ f. ward wherfore þe loue is Þe more strong. 
Þe seconde reson to preue þe same 
is itake by sikernesse and suerte of Þe children. 
For fadres and modres ben more siker and certeyn of here child 
þan Þe child of his fader and moder. 
For þe child may not be certefyed 
who is fader and moder 
but [by] sum signes and tokenes, 
by sight oþer by huyryng, 
as a child 
s e e p pat som Þersones louen hym more 
þan obere doun 
Þei arguen berby pat ben his fader and moder. 
But in p i sfirsteburþe 
he is not so wis pat he can not iknowe 
of what fader and moder he came. 
But fader and moder knowen anoon 
and ben certeyn of here child 
and ben Þerfore more certeyne of þe child banne agenward. 
Þerfore Þey louen hym more banne agenward; 
for Þeyз Þer be kynde loue 
bytwene fader and moder and children, 
зit Þe more certeyne fader and moder ben of here child, 
Þe more Þey louen hym. 
And by þe same resoun 
we may preue pat modres louen here children 
more p a n fadres doon 
for Þey ben more certeyn of hem. 
Þe Þ r i d d e resoun to preue þe same is itake 
by onynge of fadres 
and modres to þe children. 
For Þe children ben more neer and ioned to fadres and moders p a n agenward. 
Panne for loue 
is a manere onyng, 
Þe children as more ioned and neer to þe fadres and modres 
p a n agen­ ward 
ben more iloued of fadre 
and moders agenward. 
For we imagenen pat children 
ben as it were certeyn parties of fadres and modres, 
for a child is a certeyne partee departed 
fro fader and moder. 
And a partee is more ioned to þe hoole 
for it is conteyned þerinne, 
banne þe hool is ioned to | þe partie 
for it 
may not be conteyned þerinne. 
For in þe col. hoole is a partie wel feer fro anober partie 
and in Þe partie is no thing fer fro Þe hoole. 
Wherfore if a partie is meued to loue al þe hoole, 
gut it loueb not Þe hoole so strongliche; 
for in Þe hoole 
is som what pat is wel fer 
fro Þ a t partye. 
But if þe hoole is meued to loue 
Þe partee þerof, 
it l o u e p pat partee ful stronglich 
for no byng 
is in Þe partie pat is r T h e G o v e r 
n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c 
e s not in Þe hoole. 
Panne Þe child pat is as it were a gobet 
and a partie comyng of fader and moder; 
and for it is a certeyne partie of hem, 
al pat is inÞe childe 
is ny to fader and moder. 
But children ben not so strongliche imeued to loue fader and moder, 
[for Þat longeÞ to fader and moder] 
longeÞ not in pat wise to Þe children; 
and so Þei ben not so ioned to Þe children 
as children be ioned to fader and moder. 
By p i s menynge of Þe philosofer 
we may argue at Þ e fulle þat fader and moder 
scholde be besy to rewle Þe children, 
for eche scholde be besie aboute hem 
pat he loueþ strongliche. 
And children scholde be obedyent to fader and moder 
for eche scholde be obedient to hem 
Þ a t Þey knowen pat hym louen strongliche and desiren not 
but his owne good and profit. 
Panne in p i s wise 
by Þe philosofer menes we may preue Þynges 
pat were iseid 
in Þe bygynnyng of Þe chapitre. 
But for to declareÞe menynge more sÞecialliche, 
it is to wetynge 
Þat Þei[з] fader and moder loue more Þe children and wolle hem more good þanne aзenward, 
ut it is not inconuenient touchynge som man­ ere good 
Þ e i children loue fader and moder more p a n aenward. 
For as it is iseid, 
octauo Ethicorum, 
fader and moder loueÞ Þe children a[s] | f. 
som what of here owne, 
and children louen fader and moder for Þei comen of hem. 
And Þe loue Þat fader and moder hauen to Þe children comeÞ 
fro Þe worcher to Þe werk and from Þe ouer to Þe neÞer; 
and Þe loue 
Þat Þe child hauen to Þe fader and moder comeÞ 
from Þe work to Þe worchere 
and from Þe neÞer to Þe ouer. 
And f[or] Þe ouer eueth influence 
and vertue to Þe neÞer 
and keÞeÞ 
and saueÞ hem 
and not aenward, 
Þerfore fader and moder louen kyndely Þe children 
for to eue hem influence 
and vertue for to gedre for hem gode possessions and money 
by Þe whiche Þey mowe lyue and lede here lif. 
Panne fader and moder gaderen for Þe children, 
and not aenward, 
but whanne Þe children mowe, [Þei] briben and stelen 
Þe good and catel of here fader and moder. 
And Þe neÞer doun reuerence 
and ben suget to Þe ouere and Þerfore children 
doun more kyndelich reuerence and worschep to fader and moder Þan aenward. 
And if me axeth 
where fader and moder louen Þe children more p a n aenward, 
for it is al oon to loue a Þersone 
and to wille hym good, 
it is to distyngwyng of good. 
For if p o w sÞekest of profitable good 
as of moneye and oÞer good 
Þat is iordeyned 
for to lyue by, 
so fader and moder loueþ 
Þe children more þanne aenward 
for fader and moder gadren suche good for here children and children not for fader and moder. 
But if p o u sÞekest of good pat is honour and worscheÞe, 
so Þe children loueÞ 
Þe fader and moder more 
p a n aenward. 
For fader a n d moder may bettre suffre huyre sÞeke euel of children 
Þ a n n e aenward, 
for it is kyndeliche 
Þat children mowe not huyre sÞeke euel of fader and moder. 
For fader and moder hauen not so greet indigna­ cioun 
to huyre despise here children as aenward. 
v B o o k II 
It is declared what manere loue 
is bytwene fader and moder and children, 
for fader and moder louen Þe | children and gederen good col. 
and catel for hem. 
For Þei pat gederen good and catel 
for Þeere 
and ben besy for here 
liflode scholde hem gouerne and rewle, 
for Þe loue 
þat fader and moder hauen to children 
Þei scholde hem gouerne and rewle. 
But for Þe children louen fader and moder 
as hem pat Þei wollen honoure and worschep, 
and he pat scholde do honour and worschiÞe 
is in som wise soget to hym to Þe 
whiche he wolde honour 
and worscheÞe 
as by Þe loue pat fader and moder hauen to Þe children 
Þei scholde hem gouerne and rewle, 
so by Þe loue pat children 
hauen to fader and moder 
Þei scholde be obedient 
and soget to hem. 
Panne it is declared pat touchynge profitable good fader and moder louen 
Þe children more þanne aзenward. 
But touchynge good pat is honour and worscheÞe, 
children louen fader and moder more þanne agenward. 
But sympliche for to sÞeke, 
fader and moder louen Þe chil­ dren more Þan children louen fader and moder, 
for Þei ben more besy and careth more for profit of here children [pan] children doun for honour and worschep of fader and moder. Chapter V 
Thre schal be rekened pat longeþ to Þe fey by Þe whiche we may declare by Þ r e menes 
Þ a t alle citeseyns 
and namliche kynges and princes scholde besiliche rewle here children 
and teche hem 
Þe fey in here childhood. 
Þe firste, 
for fey is aboue resoun 
and is of thinges 
Þat may not be knowe by resoun. 
Þe seconde, 
Þe poyntes of Þe fey mot be sympliche itrowed. 
Þe Þridde, 
Þe fey mot be stedfasteliche | trowed. 
f. Þe first mene is declared in p i s wise. 
For Þe fey is aboue resoun 
and is of thinges 
Þat may not be iknowe by resoun, 
it is good pat it be taugt in Þat age in Þe whiche no resoun is iaxed 
but what is iseid is itrowed. 
And pat age is childhode; 
for whanne children ben iwarned 
and itaugt by fader and moder 
what Þey scholde doo and trowe, 
Þei axen non resoun whi for Þei hauen not Þe vse of resoun 
but Þei trowen anoon 
whaat Þ e fader seido 
Þ e rÞemoder. 
Þe seconde mene to preue 
Þe same may be declared in p i s wise. 
For Þe fei ‡e s of thinges 
Þat ben aboue resoun, 
Þerfore Þey scholde be trowed sympliche. 
For Þe poyntes of Þe fey scholde be trowed 
by auctorite of Good 
and by symple byleue 
and not 
by exÞerience and assaye of resoun. 
But pat is not ido inconuenientliche, 
for no man douteÞ pat Þe ordinaunce and auctorite of God passeth 
al Þe witte of mankynde. 
Wherfore it is bettere to trowe sympliche Þe auctorite of God 
Þ a n stonde to resons 
and demonstraciouns of mankynde. 
Panne if Þe poyntes of Þe fey 
scholde be sympliche itrowed, 
he scholde be comonlyche itaugt 
in pat age 
pat troweth sympliche and sone, 
and pat r T h e G o v e r 
n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s age is childhood. 
For as we seide inÞefirstebook 
whanne we treted of maners of children pat children trowen sympliche and sone, 
Þerfore, ii Ethicorum, 
it is iseyd Þat children scholde be itaugt by Þe lawe; 
andÞere of Þe moder 
and Þe lore of Þe fey of fader and moder. 
if in oÞer lawes fader and moder be anon besy to teche here children 
þe poyn|tes of col. 
here owne fey 
and of here owne lawe 
for pat age troweÞ sympliche and sone, 
moche more Cristene men scholde teche Þe children here fey in here childhood. 
For owre lawe passeth 
alle Þeere lawes 
and is withoute wemme and wiÞoute smyttynge of errours, 
and in oÞer e lawes falsede 
is imedled wyþ trouthe. 
Þe Þridde mene to preue Þe same is itake for Þe poyntes of Þe fey scholde be stedefastliche ytrowed. 
And we s e e p pat vsage is as it were anoÞer kynde, 
as it is iseid in libro De Memoria et Remeniscencia. 
And Þe resoun herof 
is asyned [in] Rethoric[is], 
Þere it is iseid 
Þat kynde is alwey 
and vsage is ofte 
and what is ofte is nyg thing 
Þat is alwey. 
Wherfore vsage is nyg kynde; 
þanne Þe more a þyng is vsed, 
Þe more it torneÞ in to kynde 
and is Þe more feruentliche ihoolde. 
Panne for we ben more ivsed in þynges Þat we vsen in childhood þan in Þeere þynges 
and so we trowen hem more stedfastliche 
and wiÞoute eny doute, 
Þe poyntes of Þe fey scholde be taut vs in child­ hood. 
Þerfore, ii M ethaphisicorum, 
Þe philosofer wol preue pat v s a g 
e is of greet doynge and seiÞ in Þ Í S wise: 
p o u mygt wete and knowe 
how moche vsage makeÞ and doþ, 
takyng hede to Þe lawe 
in Þe whiche children trowen fables and appolleges, 
falce talis and scorneful, 
p a n m o r e treuÞe and sÞeenesse. 
And if Þe lawe of nacions 
and mysbelyued men 
conteynen manye fables and appologes, 
many false fables and scorneful, 
and ben itaugt children in here 
зouthe for Þey scholde be vsed þerinne and trowe 
Þe poyntes Þerof stedefastliche, 
Þe poyntes of Cristene fey 
Þat onlich is rigtful 
and vniuersal scholde be taugt children | 
f. in here gouthe. 
And for it longeþ to Clerkes and doctours 
to knowe distincteliche 
Þe poyntes and articles of Þe fey 
and trete sot‡eliche Þe poyntes 
þerof and teche hem to oÞere, 
and lewede men 
and namelich childrin 
mot not haue so 
[so]til knowleche of Þe feyÞe; Þerfore it is inow to hem to lerne 
Þe poyntes boystousliche 
and in a certeyne summe so pat Þei b e taugt pat 
Þer is oon God almygty, creatour of alle, 
Fader and Sone and Holy Goost; 
and Þat oure firste fader Adam synnede and mankynde 
was infecte by his synne. 
Þerfore to saue vs Goddes sone took flesch and blood of a mayde 
and was ibore of hure, 
and suffrede d e p for oure synne 
and was iburyed, 
and wente doun in to helle and brougte Þennes Þe goode soules 
Þat were Þer e in presoun, 
and roos fro d e e p Þe Þridde day and styghe vp in to heuene 
and sitteÞ 
in his fader rigt hond, 
and schal eft come to Þe doom. 
And we alle schal arise 
and stonde tofore v Þe B 
o o k II hym 
at þe doom 
and eue rekenyng 
of alle oure dedes 
so þat Þei Þat doun 
wel schal goo 
in to lif wiÞoute ende 
and Þei þat doun euel 
in to fuyre wiÞoute ende. 
Panne alle cyteseyns scholde be besy 
Þat here children 
lerne p i s fey in here childhood. 
And Þe more good and profit may come to Þe regne and to Cristene religione 
by strong fey of children of kynges and of princes and Þe more 
Þeril may come of here feynt fey, 
Þe more besy kynges and princes scholde be pat here children lernede fey in childhood. Chapter VI 
The more noble Þe soule is passyng Þe body, 
Þe more besy alle citeseyns 
and namlich kynges 
and princes scholde be þat here children 
be more parfit in soule |þannein body. 
Panne if Þei ben besy aboute col. heritage and money to helÞe here children 
in bodilich nede, 
Þ e i scholde be moche more besy to do þat here children 
be parfit in soule 
and itaut in vertues and good maners. 
And for Þis is so good and profitable 
Þat it scholde not be forgenderyng 
but children scholde be tauзt in child­ hood 
to forsake outrage 
and euel maners 
and to folwe goode þewes and maners. 
And we may preue 
by foure mens pat children 
scholde be tauзt in childhood 
to vse good maneres. 
Þe firste is itake for likynge 
is as it were kyndeliche; 
Þe seconde, 
by defaute of resoun; 
Þe Þridde, 
by inclynacioun 
pat we hauen to euel; 
Þe fer Þe, 
by forsakynge of contrarie disposicioun. 
Þefirstemene is declarid in Þ I S wise. 
For, iii Eticorum, 
Þe philosofer seith þat it is so kyndelich to vs to haue likyng pat 
in childhod we begynnen to haue likyng. 
Þerfore children hauen likyng anon whan Þei 
‡bygennen to souke tetes and breestes. 
Panne зif likyng wexe so 
w i p ows in childhood, 
in childhood schulde suche likynge be wipstonde. 
Þerfore by cause of Þat kynde likynge, 
anoon as children kun­ n e p sÞeke and vnderstonde 
Þei scholde be tauзt 
to vse good maners 
by techyng, chargyng and warnynge. Þe seconde mene to preue 
Þe same is itake 
by defaute of resoun. 
For þanne Þei scholde be most itaut 
and imeued to good maners 
whanne Þei ben most inclyned to yuel maners 
and outrage and moost passionat. 
But as Þe philosofer meneþ, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
in ong age men 
ben most disposed to lecherie 
and to euel maneres 
and passionate 
and folweÞ passions. 
Wherfore Þanne it is most need to helÞe so pat by chargynge and 
war|nyng and Þewe coreccions 
Þey may be wiÞdrawe 
f. fro lecherie and outrage. 
Panne for resoun refrayneÞ lecherie, outrage and likynge, 
Þe more defaute a man 
h a p of resoun 
Þe more he is inclyned to folwe passions. 
Panne in ong age children 
scholde be r T h e G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c 
e s tauзt to vse good maners, 
for Þanne Þei ben most defaute of resoun 
and most folwen passions. 
Þe Þridde mene 
is itake by inclinacioun 
þat we hauen to euel. 
For whanne a man 
is inclined to som dede, 
hym nedeþ to vse 
Þe contrarie Þ a t he falle not to þat dede. 
For comynliche maners of men ben as it were a croked erde. 
Þerfore Þe philosofer seith, 
circa finem, ii Ethicor­ um, 
Þat we scholde rewle vs to good maners 
as a croked erd 
is irewled to be euene. 
And he pat wol make a croked erd euene 
he streccheth Þe erd 
and bendeþ 
it bacward to Þe contrarie side; 
and Þe erd Þat is so 
ibend turneþ 
anon aзen to Þe mene 
and is streit and euene. 
And so we, 
for we hauen inclinacioun 
to suche crokednesse 
and to euel 
and to vnlaweful likyng, 
we schulde longe tyme absteyne vs fro vnlaweful likynge 
pat we myзt putte of suche inclinacioun. 
And as a erd Þat scholde be streit and imaad euene 
is ibend passynge 
Þ e ritnesse and euennesse toward Þe oÞer side 
Þat it may come aзen to Þe mene and abyde riзt and euene, 
and so in forsakyng likynge we scholde passe Þe mene 
and forsake manye manere likynge, 
and on caas sum laweful likynge 
pat we myte Þe sonner 
and Þe betre absteyne 
fro vnlaweful likynge. 
Panneifwe hauen so greet 
inclyna|cioun to euel 
Þat vs nedeþ col. in Þat wise to vse Þe contrarie longe tyme pat 
we may putte of Þe bettre 
Þe inclynacioun to euel 
and be inclined to good, 
we schulde in child­ hood 
bygynne to forsake lecherie 
and outrage 
and folwe good maners 
and no lenger abyde 
but bygynne in childhood. 
Þe ferÞe mene is itake 
by excitynge of contrarie habite 
and dis­ posicioun. 
For children ben nesche and sone ouercome, 
if Þei folwen lecherie and likyng wiÞoute refraynyng, 
anoun vicious habites 
and dis­ posiciouns 
ben iprented in hem 
as Þe liknes of a seel 
is sone iprented in Þe nesche wex pat is wel itemÞered. 
Pan pat cheldron ben not vi­ cious, 
anon in childhood 
Þey scholde be icharged, iwarned, and itaut, 
and ichasted to leue 
and forsake lecherie likynge and outrage. 
Panne alle citesens scholde be besy pat here children be tauзt in зouÞe 
to vse goode maneres. 
But Þe more goodnesse may come to Þe regne by goodnesse of children of kynges and of princes 
and Þe more malice and harme may come of here malice, 
Þe more besy kynges and princes scholde be Þat here children 
be itaut in childhood 
to vse good maneres. Chapter VII 
Thei it were semelich pat a l l e men knewe letters to be Þerby prudent, wise, and redy 
and to be Þe more waar of vnlaweful doyng, 
git it semeÞ> 
pat som men hauen skilful excusacioun 
Þeiз he go not to scole and lerne letters. 
And suche ben pore men 
Þat hauen not wherby 
to libbe and semeÞ skilfulliche excused Þeiз he wiÞdrawe hem 
fro I scole for to gete here liflode. 
But gentel men and noble and namlich kynges and princes 
pat ben riche inow ben gretliche | 
to blamynge if f. 
Þey setten not here children 
to scole in childhood. And pat lernyng of letters scholde bygynne in childhood 
we may preue by p re menes. 
Þe firste is itake 
by distyncte and redy sÞeche; 
Þe seconde, 
by takynge good heed; 
Þe Þridde, 
by Þerfeccioun pat is in sciens 
and in kunnynge. 
For Þei pat wolle lerne lettres schulde kunne sÞeke 
and sowne literal wordes; 
and Þei schulde also Studie and take heede of þynges 
þat ben itaugt by letters. 
Þe Þridde, 
Þei scholde doo al here besynesse 
and mygt to come to Þerfeccioun of science and of connyng. 
Þe firste mene is declared in p i s wise. 
For we seen in comyne lon­ geages of diuerse londes 
pat vnneÞe may eny man 
sowne langage ariзt 
but he be vsed Þerto in his childhood. 
And if a man passeþ 
whan he is of ful age 
in to fer londes 
where Þe langages ben 
dyuerse,þ o u зÞei ben Þer 
e longe tyme vnneÞe oÞer neuer 
he may sowne any langage aryзt. 
But alwey men of Þe londe knowen pat he is a strongeer 
and not ibore in pat contray. 
Panne if it fareth so 
in langages of lewede men, 
moche more it fareth so 
in literal langage pat is philosofres langage. 
For philosofres seye pat no comyne lewed langage 
was compleet and parfit by Þe which Þei migt parfitlich rekene and sÞeke of kyndes of þynges 
and of maneres of 
me‡n and of cours of Þe sterres 
and of oÞere thinges of Þe whiche Þei wolde despute, 
Þei fonde vp as it were 
a proÞer langage pat hatte Latyno Þ e ra literal langage 
so large and copious pat Þei mygte Þerby schewe and telle out 
al here menynge at Þe folle. 
Panne if p i s langage is so | large and complet and we may not sowne col. oÞere langages arigt 
but we be vsed þerto in childhood, 
þanne if we wollen sÞeke Latyn arigt and lerne letters, 
we scholde vse lettres in childhod. 
Þe seconde mene to preue 
Þe same is itake 
by takyng good hede and feruentnesse 
pat scholde be in Studie, 
for neuere man studieþ wel 
but he be feruent 
and take good heede 
to þe studye. 
Panne for vsage is as it were 
Þe oÞer kynde, 
for [in] Poletic[is] 
Þe philosofer seith pat workes 
pat we vsen in childhood 
plesen vs best for eche man 
is most feruent 
and takeÞ best hede to þyng pat pleseth hym best, 
Þanne pat we may be feruent 
and take hede to literal Studie, 
we scholde lerne literal lore 
in childhood 
and þanne we scholde be feruent 
and take good heede Þerto. 
Þe Þridde mene 
is itake by Þerfeccioun pat is in science 
Þat schal be lerned. 
For selde oÞer neuere 
a man comeþ 
to parfit science 
but he bygynne as it were 
fro his cradel 
to geue hym to science. 
For Þei Þe angels be wel disposed 
fro here firste makynge 
to vnderstondyng 
and knowe kyndes of thinges, 
git man fro Þe tyme 
Þat he is ibore is euel disposed to take discipline and science. 
For Þey oo man haue betere v T h e G o v e r 
n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s wit p a n anoÞer, 
ut generalliche whan men ben ibore 
Þei ben euel disposed to discipline and science, 
for owre knowyng bygynneþ 
and comeÞ 
of Þe witnesse of felyng 
and of Þe later. 
Þerfore, primo De Anima, 
Þe philosofer 
m e n e p 
þat Þe soule 
is more tyme vncunnynge p a n connynge, 
for a man v s e p studye long tyme 
or he come to parfit science and cunnynge. 
Panne for oure lif 
is schort and artes and science 
ben harde and longe and comonlich | 
men ben ibore euel disposed f. to take science, 
з if we wollen come som tyme to parfit science, 
we scholde bygynne in childhood 
and as it were 
fro Þe cradel. 
Panne alle gentil men 
and noble and namelich kynges and princes if Þei wol 
p a i here children 
sÞeke literal sÞeche ariз 
t and p a i hey come to parfit science 
and be feruent and take good hede þerto, 
Þei m o i e set hem to scole in childhood. 
For as it is iseid tofore, 
no man is kyndelich a lord 
but he be vnderstondyng, prudent, wis and redy. 
Panne for by knowyng of lettres man is imaad 
Þe more vnderstondyng, prudent, wis and redy, 
Þe more semelich it is p a i children of kynges and princes 
be more prudent, wise, and redy p 
a n oÞer e children, 
Þe m o r e semeliche it is pai 
Þei be sette to scole in childhood. 
And to preue Þe same anoþer resoun may be brout. 
For but a prince be vnderstondyng, prudent, wis and redi, 
liзtliche he bycomeÞ a tyraunt. 
For he reccheÞ not of workes of vertues 
but Þei teilen pris of money 
and outward good more þanne Þei scholde. 
And þanne he bycomeÞ 
a tyrant and pileþ 
and spoilleth Þe puple. 
Panne for children of kyngges and of princes scholde not be tyrantes 
whanne Þei ben isette in lordschiÞe, 
it is semelich Þat Þei be sette to scole in childhood 
p a i Þei may be vnderstondyng, prudent, wis and redy. r Chapter VIII Olde auctorite m e n e p pai among men 
in olde tyme were seuene famous sciens 
pai ben icleÞed gramatica, dialetica, rethorica, musica, arsmetrica, geometria, astronomya. 
Alle Þes | ben icleÞed liberal and fre col. sciens, 
for children of fre men 
and noble and gentil men 
were iset to Þes sciens. 
And children of noble men lernedefirstgramer, 
for as Allepharabius 
s e i p p 
a i gramer was ifounde for to saue Þe sÞeche 
wiþoute errour for me 
scholde not make defaute 
in sownynge of sÞeche. 
And by gramer we seruen sÞeche of philosoferes, 
for in suche sÞeche Þei made here bokes and taute here sciens p a n . Panne for we suffisen not 
by vsself to fynde al pai 
nedeþ to sciens 
but vs nedeÞ 
þerto helpe of philosofres and doctours, 
it is sÞedful to vs to konne 
and to knowe Þe sÞech 
p a i doctors and philosofers sÞekyn; 
and p a i is iknowe by gramer. 
And Þerfore gramer 
is acounted among liberal sciences, 
‡ for children of fre men 
and noble lernide pai science. 
B o o k II Þe ii liberal science ‡ hatte dioletica and techeÞ 
Þe maner of argewyng 
and of apposyng. 
For oure manere of konnyng 
is by þewe arguments 
a n d resons to preue 
a n d declare oure purpos, 
Þanne it nedeÞ to haue som science 
Þat he techeth Þe manere of makyng 
and formyng ‡ argumentis and resons. 
But we knewe Þe manere of argewyng, 
we myзt faile in arguyng 
and so be deceyued and trowe som tyme pat we conclude wel Þey we conclude amys 
for we knowen not 
Þe manere of argewyng. 
Panne as grammer is nedful pat rewleth Þe tonge pat we erre not in sÞekyng, 
so as Allepharabius seith, dioletica is nedful 
Þat rewleth Þe tonge and Þe inwyt in argewyng. 
Þe Þ r i d d e liberal science is rethorica. 
[Rethorica] is as it were boys­ tous dioletica 
as Þe philosofer meneth in Rethoricis suis. 
For as sotel resons ben imaad in natural science 
and in o Þ e r | speculatif science, 
so f. boystous resouns ben imaad in moral science 
þat treteÞ of doynges and dedes. 
Panne as dioletica is nedful pat 
techeth sotelle and swyft manere of arguyng, 
so rethorica is nedful pat is as it were boystous dioletica and techeth 
boistous manere of argewyng 
and by liknesse and figures. 
And it is nedful to children of fre men and noble and nameliche to children of kynges and of princes, 
for Þey mot be moche among men 
and be lordes of puple 
Þat may not vnderstonde 
but boistous resons and liknesses and figures. 
Þe ferÞe liberal science hatte musica and accordeÞ to children 
as Þe philosofer seith, 
viii Poleticorum, 
and namlich to children of fre men and noble for many resons. 
OonÞerof is for children 
mowe suffre no sorwe. 
Panne for┌sum┐┌likynge┐scholde be graunted to hem, 
it is wel ido pat Þey b e ordeyned to likyng pat greueth not. 
Wherfore Þe philos­ ofer 
m e n e p pat musik 
is acordynge to children kynde, 
for in musik is likynge pat greueth not. 
Þe seconde reson to Þe same may be for as Þe philosofer meneþ, viii Poleticorum, 
mannes þought 
can not be idel. 
Þerfore to putte of idelnesse 
it is good som tyme vse likyng of musik 
pat is laweful and greueth not. 
And pat is most semelich for children 
of fre men and noble pat vseth no craft of hond 
Þe work and scholde be idel 
but he vsede liberal science 
and som tyme likyng of musik 
Þ a t is laweful and honest. 
And in Poleticis 
Þe philosofer toucheÞ manye resons 
by Þe whiche it myзt be preued pat children 
of noble men schulde lerne musik, 
| but on caas pat schal be touched inneremore. 
col. Þefifteliberal science 
hatte arthsmetrica 
and techeÞ proporcions of nombres. 
And Þerto on caas children 
of fre men 
and noble scholde be sette, 
forÞerwithoute musik may not be conne. 
Þe sexte liberal science 
is gemetri and techeth 
to knowe mesures and quantite of thinges. 
And Þerto children of noble men ben isette, 
for Þerwithoute astronomye 
may not be cunne parfitliche pat 
is of quantite of sterres 
and of Þe space betwene sterres 
and of Þe cours of hem. 
v The G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d Pr i n c e s 
Þe seuenthe liberal science hat astronomye. 
And Þer to children 
of noble men 
were iset in oolde tyme, 
for nacions and mysbeleued men 
were to besy aboute Þe cours 
of Þe sterres 
and to knowe eche fro oÞer . 
And wolde neuere bygynnefightyngen 
o Þ e roÞer werk 
but Þei knewe Þe degree pat was ascendent 
and Þe condicioun of heuene. 
And for pat is iknowe by astronomye, 
children of fre men 
and noble wolde lerne astronomye. 
In p i s wise oolde men menede of liberal science 
and cleÞede hem seuene artes. 
Netheles many oÞere science 
ben moche betre and more noble 
p a n Þes seuene, 
for natural philosofie techeth 
to knowe kyndes of thinges 
and is moche bettre p a n eny of Þe forseide seuene. 
But p i s work suffreth not to trete Þerof, 
for in p i s work 
mot be boystous tretes 
by liknes 
offigures.Also methaphisica is ifounde 
by trauaille and resons of mankynde 
and treteþ of God and of angelis 
and is moche betere 
p a n natural philosofie and more worthi 
p a n eny of Þe forseide seuene. 
Þe philosofer, primo Methaphisicorum, 
‡seith pat kynde is more noble | f. and worthi and is to vnderstondyng of science 
pat ben ifounde 
by trauaille of mankynde, 
among Þe whiche methaphisica 
b e r e p Þe pris. 
Also þeologia, 
d[i]uyni<Þe, 
treteþ of God 
and of angelis 
and is not ifounde be trauaille of mankynde 
but by inspiracioun of God 
and is withoute comparison betere and more noble 
p a n al Þe oÞer. 
Also som moral science 
as ethica pat 
is of mannes owne rewelyng, 
and yconom­ yca pat 
is of rewelyng of manye, 
and politica pat is of Þe rewelyng of citees 
and of regnes 
is ful good and nedful to children of fre men and noble. 
And as it schal be declared in Þe processe, 
children of noble men 
and namlich of kynges and princes, 
зif a wol lyue politik 
lif and rewle oÞere men, 
schold eue hem most to pis science. 
And som science ben subalternate and vnder Þes sciences, 
as Þe science ÞersÞectiua 
pat is of Þe siзt 
and vnder geometrie; 
and medicina is vnder naturel philosophie; 
and lawes pat ben of dedes of mankynde ben vnder poletica, 
pat is of rewelyng of citees and of regnes. 
For as we seide in oÞer place, 
alle legistres ben 
as it were lewede, 
mad and ‡nyce poletici. 
For as ‡lewede men 
[and] Þe comune puple, 
for he argueÞe not 
and makeÞ resons 
by Þe manere of arguenge pat dioletica techeÞe 
and for he argueth not craftyliche and by dioletica, 
Þei ben cleÞed of Þe philosofer ydyote dyaletici, lewed, maad, 
and nyse dialetici; 
so for legistres rekeneth 
withoute resoun doynges and dedes of polici, 
Þei mowe be cleÞed ydyote politici, lewede, maad, and nyse politici. 
Herby it may be knowe how þei pat 
kunneÞ poleticam and morale science 
scholde be more iworscheÞed 
p a n Þey pat [kunneÞe lawes. 
For Þey pat sÞeken] | 
with konnynge and knoweÞ Þe cause and col. 
telleÞe cause of kunnyng 
and of sÞekyng 
ben more worschepful p a n Þei pat sÞeken 
and knowen not Þe cause. 
r B o o k II Herby it may be knowe what Clerkes scholde be moste yworschep­ ed, 
forfirstdyuynes scholde be worscheÞed 
pat knoweth and kunneÞ diuinite. 
For as God hymself is God of al, 
so diuinitee that is principa­ liche of God 
is god and lady of al science of mankynde. 
And after dyuynes methaphesici scholde be most worscheÞed, 
for as it is iseid tofore hond, 
among sciences Þat ben ifounde 
by traueille of mankynde methaphisica bereth Þe pris. 
And after hem naturel philosofres scholde be worscheÞed, 
for þei naturel philosofie be wiÞinne methaphisica, 
зit it bereth Þe pris among alle oÞere sciens pat ben ifounde 
by traueyle of mankynde. 
Panne in p i s wise Clerkes scholde be werscheÞed in here degree. 
Panne for science ben deuyded in p i s wise, 
it may be sone iknowe 
aboute what science children of noble men and namlich of kynges and of princes scholde be occupied. 
And for Þei mot be 
as it were half god­ dis and take besiliche heede to nedes 
Þat longeth to rewelyng and mowe not a while 
to Studie sotelliche in sotel science, 
Þanne it is most seme­ lich pat Þei b e re hem wel in Goddes seruice and knowe Þe fey 
and be stedefast þerinne 
and kunne Þe science 
by Þe whiche he schulde 
kunne rewle hemself and oÞere. 
And suche sciences ben moral sciences. 
And Þey schulde kunne oÞer e science 
in so moche 
as he serueÞ and helÞeth to moral science. 
Panne Þei scholde | 
kunne gramer for f. 
to vnderstonde literal langage and sÞeche 
in Þe whiche langage and sÞeche 
bothe moral science 
and oÞer science 
ben iwrete and itauзt. 
And Þeiз gramer helÞe not in moral mater, 
зet kynges and princes schulde kunne literal langage and sÞeche for to write here counsaile and preveyte to wham hem 
likeþ vnwetynge oþer men. 
And children of noble men, 
how euere Þei be set and iordeyned 
to be knyзtes 
and to eue hem 
to rewelyng and to politik mater, 
зit Þei scholde kunne literal sÞeche and lerne 
som what of dealetica and of rethorica 
for to be Þe more sotel 
to vnderstonde 
al nedes and tales 
pat ben purposed and itreted. 
And þanne Þei scholde sette al here wit 
to vnderstonde moral mater 
and to kunne reule hemself and oÞere. 
And of musik as Þe philos­ ofer seith [in] Poletic[is] Þei scholde kunne 
in so moche as it helÞeth to good maners. 
Panne in p i s wise 
Þei pat wolle be princes 
scholde knowe moral mater: 
so Þat Þei knewe non oÞer science, 
зut Þei scholde bysiliche Studie 
to lerne moral mater 
boistousliche in comyn langage and sÞeche, 
for þerby a prince is ytaut 
at Þe folle 
in what wise he scholde be prince 
and how he may brynge hymself and citeseyns 
to vertues and good maneres. 
v T h e G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s Chapter IX Circa finem, tercio Ethicorum, 
Þe philosofer liknethÞe concupiscible of princes 
to a childe 
and likneth resoun to Þe maister. 
Panne as Þe concupiscible nedeÞ 
to be rewled by resoun, 
so Þe child nedeÞ 
to be rewled by his maister. 
Wherfore as resoun 
draw|eth alwey to Þe firste, 
col. 
as it is iseid, 
iii Ethicorum, 
and so Þe maister of children 
scholde alwey excite hem to Þe beste. 
Panne for in lore 
and in techyng of children 
Þe final entent 
is for to brynge hem to Þe beste, 
for by Þe ende and fynal ententÞe resoun of al Þe oÞer 
e scholde be take, 
Þe maister schulde be suche oon 
Þat myзte brynge his children 
to Þ e beste. 
And Þe beste good to Þe whiche children 
scholde be brought is double: 
cunnynge and maners. 
And a childe is ibrouзt 
to good maneres 
in twey manere wise: 
by ensample of good leuynge 
and by sÞeche, 
warnyng and chastynge. 
And as it longeth to p i s doynge, 
Þe maister of children of noble men 
and namlich of kynges 
and of princes scholde haue p r e in hemself: 
for Þei scholde be konnynge in spculatif mater; 
prudens, wise, 
and redy in dedes and doynge; 
and good in leuynge. 
And to be konnynge in speculatif mater 
n e d e p p r e . First, 
þat Þei kunne fynde of hymself rewles and resouns. 
Þe seconde, 
pat Þei kunne vnderstonde lawes 
and menynges of oÞer men. 
Þe Þridde, 
pat Þei kunne wel deme in thinges 
pat Þei fynden 
and also in þynges 
pat Þei vnderstonden of Þeere men. 
And Þei scholde kunne fynde rewles and resons, 
for he Þat can in no wise fynde rewles and resons but oonliche telleth 
Þe lawes of oÞere men 
is more verreyliche a rehersour p a n a fyndere. 
Panne he schulde kunne fynde. 
Þe seconde, 
Þei scholde be vnderstondynge 
and alwey besy and scharÞe of wit. 
For as | no man is suffisaunt to hymself 
at Þe folle in f. leuynge, 
but for to haue suffisaunt leuynge 
we mot leue in companye so pat we may be releued 
by help of oÞere men in þynges pat n e d e p to leuyng: 
and so moche more as Þe philosofer meneth, 
ii M ethaphis­ icorum, 
no man suffiseth to hymsilf in speculatif mater, 
but alwey Þe later philosofres hauen help and socour of writynge of philosofres 
pat were tofore hem. 
Panne it sufficeÞ not to parfit konnyng pat a m a n kunne fynde rewles and resons 
but Þei mot be besy and scharp of wit 
and vnderstonde menynge of Þeere men. 
Þe þridde, 
Þei mot kunne wel deme, 
for parfit science and kunnynge stondeÞ 
most in good doom. 
For it is not inow to vnderstonde lawes 
and menynge of oÞer e men 
and fynde many rewles and resons 
but Þei kunne also of thinges 
pat he vnderstondeÞ and fyndeÞ and deme whiche scholde be holde 
and whiche scholde be forsake. 
Panne touchinge sciens and kunnynge 
Þe maister and Þe techere mot kunne wel fynde and vnderstonde 
and be besy and scharp of wit and wel r B 
o o k II deme of menyng 
pat he vnderstondeÞ and fyndeÞ. 
For Þ e i зit were so pat children of noble men 
and namelich of kynges and of princes 
wolde not trauele to haue al Þe depnesse of science 
and of konnynge 
but holde hem apaied to knowe som what Þerof, 
nathales зut 
†Þe maister schulde be suffisaunt†; for Þe lore of wise men 
and redy is liзt, 
and Þei pat vnderstonden cler|liche sÞeken clerliche. 
Panne Þei scholde col. vnderstonde 
Þe more lightlyche and clerliche, 
cunne and knowe Þe litel what Þat Þei desiren to lerne, 
[by k n o w y n g e p a n 
by n o t k n o w y n g e ] . 
Hit is iseye whiche Þe maister scholde be 
and how he scholde be kunnynge; 
it is to wetynge 
how Þei scholde be prudens, 
wise and redy in dedes and doynge 
for to teche children and forme hem in gode maneres. 
And to descreue suche prudencia, 
wisdom and 
redynesse,Þei we myte rekene al Þe eiзte 
Þat we rekened 
in Þe firste book, 
de prudencia, 
зut heere it is inow to rekene foure Þer of. 
Panne Þe maister of noble children 
scholde be so prudent and wise and redy 
Þat Þei ben avised and purveyed, 
waar and exÞert, 
and haue mynde of þynges 
Þat ben apassed. 
For as he pat wolde strecche 
and riзt a croked erde 
scholde neuere rite 
Þat erde 
but he knewe whoderward 
and in what side 
Þe erde is croked, 
so he þat wol righte and amende oÞer e men in dedes 
may neuere amende hem ariзt 
but he knowe thinges 
Þat ben apassed 
by Þe whiche 
Þei may knowe pat men don amys. 
Panne he pat scholde teche 
Þeere men mot haue mynde of thinges 
þat ben apassed. 
Þe seconde, 
Þe mayster mot be avised 
and waar of thinges 
Þat ben to comynge. 
For as Þe techere and rewelere of oÞer 
e men mot haue mynde of thinges 
Þat ben apassed 
þat he may knowe by thinges 
pat ben apassed 
in what wise his scolers ben myswend, 
so Þei moot be avised and waar of thinges 
Þat ben to comyng pat he may Þe betere ordeyne 
remedye aenste | thinges pat may myshapÞe. 
f. Þe Þridde, 
he moot be waar. 
For as we touchede inÞefirstebook, 
as in knowynge and speculatif matere it 
nedeÞ to be waar leste falsenesse 
be medled wit trouthe, 
so in dedes and doynge it 
nedeÞ to be waar leste euel be medled with trouthe. 
For som euel semeth good 
at Þ e firste siзt 
and som falshede semeth trouthe. 
Wherfore as a maister in speculatif mater 
scholde be besy 
and waar and teche his scolers trouthe wiÞoute medlyng of falsede, 
so he pat wol rewle children 
mot be waar and teche hem good withoute 
medlyng of euel. 
Þe fer Þe, 
suche a mayster scholde be wel avised 
alle aboute and exÞert. 
For Þei pat ben exÞert knowen particuler doynges 
and suche a mayster 
mot knowe particuler condiciouns of children 
þat he schal rewle. 
For as children hauen diuerse condicions 
and ben inclyned 
in diuerse wise to do amys, 
so Þei mot in diuerse wise 
be itaut and ichasted. 
v T h e G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s Panne Þe maister of children 
moot be suche oon pat may and can by Þewe sÞeche warnynge and chastynge to brynge Þe children to good. 
And for a child is brouзt to good not oonlich by warnynge and chastynge 
but also by ensau[m]ple of good workes, 
suche a maister moot be of good lif and honest. 
And for Þe age of childhod 
is gretliche inclyned to intemporatnesse 
and to fleschly lust and likynge, 
Þeiз Þe maister of children 
teche neuere so good wordes, 
yit if he d o p Þe contrarie in dede Þe children 
folwen his ensample 
and ben sone inclyned to do amys. | col. 
And so it is declared 
Þat Þe mayster of children 
mot be connynge 
in speculatif matere and fynde of hymself rewles and resons 
and vnder­ stondeþ menynges of oÞer e men 
and deme wel bothe thinges 
þat he vnderstondeþ and fyndeþ. 
And touchy[ng] prudencia, 
wit <and> redinesse of dedes and doyng, 
he mot haue good mynde 
and be avised and waar and exÞert and take good hede; 
and touching Þe lif he moot be honest and good. 
Panne if kynges and princes and alle citeseins 
ben swithe besy in whaat wise 
Þei mowe ordeyne for here children money and oÞere r[i]chesses and soules catel; 
for Þe philosofer seith, primo Polethicorum, 
alwey of souled þynges is more charge 
p a n of vnsouled þynges 
and of children more 
p a n of oÞer e, 
Þei scholde be swyþe besy 
and with greet besynesse 
tak hede what maner maister 
Þei t a k e n to rewle here children. Chapter X Circa finem, 
vii Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer techeth pat children scholde be refrayned 
in sÞekyng 
and in lokynge 
and in heryng, 
for children scholde not sÞeke in al maner wise 
no})er see ne loke in al maner wise, 
noþer hire ne herkene in al maner tales; 
but Þer e most be sum maner honest sÞekyng, 
lokyng and herkenyng. 
In sÞekyng chil­ dren may faylle in p r e maner wise: first, 
for Þei sÞeken gladliche of lecherie and of harletrie; 
Þe 
seconde,Þe[i]sÞeken liзtliche falshede; 
Þe þridde, 
for comuneliche Þei sÞeken nycete and folye and withoute avisement. 
And first, 
Þey sÞeken of lecherie. 
| 
For as it is iseide tofore, primo f. [libro], 
children folwen passions 
and ben inclyned to lecherie. 
Panne for alwey 
mot be a cautel where Þerei semeth, 
children scholde be refrayned of sÞekynge of lecherie 
and of foule wordes, 
and also þei scholde be chasted зyf Þei vsen suche sÞekyng. 
And Þe philosofer seth pat Þei scholde be refrayned 
and ichasted of foule manere sÞekynge, 
for li┌ght┐liche by suche sÞekyng 
Þey ben Þe more inclined 
to suche manere dedes. 
For sÞekyng of foule thinges 
makeþ vs haue mynde 
of vnlaweful likynges 
and þerby oure desir 
is Þe more to suche likynge; 
and whanne oure desire is Þe more, 
we ben Þe more inclyned þerto. r B o o k II 
Þerfore it is wel iseid 
pat schrewed talkynge corrumÞeth and apaireth maneres. 
Panne children scholde be refrayned 
and ichasted of sÞekyng of lecherie. 
Þe seconde, children scholde be refrayned 
and ichasted of sÞekynge falshede, 
for as we seide tofore, 
children fynden sone tales 
of here owne heed. 
And for vsage is as it were 
Þe oÞer kynde and yonge age 
inclyneth hem to sÞeke falshede and lesynges 
and pat is euel of itself 
and to forsakynge 
as Þe philosofer seith, iiii Ethicorum, 
þanne by Þewe monyciouns, warnyng and chastynge, 
children scholde be brout to forsake lesynges 
and to loue wel sothenesse and trouthe. 
And Þat is god of itself 
and to preysyng 
as Þe philosofer seith, iiii Ethicorum. 
Þe þridde, 
children scholde be refrayned of sÞekyng withoute avise­ ment. 
For children ben inexÞert and knowen but fewe thingges; 
and Þei þat knowen 
but few 
þyng|es answeren sone 
and euen a le wed col. answere and so a foles bolt 
is sone ischote. 
Wherfore children scholde be refrayned 
þat Þei eue not here answere to sone; 
for Þei no man be sodeynlich most parfit 
and Þei children mowe not anon be parfit, wise and redy, 
зit if Þei vsen 
to answere with avisement 
and to sÞeke not withoute avisement, 
Þei mow be desposed in passyng of tyme. 
It is declared how maisters of children 
scholde teche hem 
how Þei scholde haue hem in sÞekyng; 
it is to wetynge 
how children scholde be tauзt in sight. 
And in lokynge of children 
moste be double cautele. 
First, touchynge thinges pat ben iseie; 
[seconde, touchynge maner of lokyng: 
and touchynge thinges pat ben 
iseie,] 
for as it is vnsemelich pat children sÞeke foule, 
so it is vnsemelich pat Þei see 
and looke on foule thinges. 
And Þe philosofer 
t e l l e p Þe cause heerof, 
vii Ethicorum, 
and seith pat alÞefirstwe louen best. 
Þerfore alle foule thinges 
and al pat is infecte 
mot be strange to children, 
for þynges pat ben first iseie 
ben iseie with most wondryng. 
Wherfore we taken Þe more heede Þerto and hauen hem 
Þe more in mynde. 
Panne for alle thinges 
ben newe to children, 
Þei taken Þe more feruent heede to thinges pat Þei seen, 
wherfore if it hapÞeth 
Þat Þei see foule doynges, 
Þei hauen Þe more mynde 
Þer of and ben Þe more inclyned Þerto. 
Þerfore Þe philosofer forbedeth pat children scholde not onlich be refrayned of foule sightes 
in dede but also in Þeynture and images. 
if naked wymmen ben iÞeynt and igraue þerinne, 
suche Þeynture scholde not be schewed for children. 
For children ben isterede of hemself 
at Þe folle to lecherie 
and folweÞ passiouns, 
|þannehem nedeþ nought to be 
Þe more istered to f. lust and likynge 
by siзt of foule thinges. 
Þe seconde, 
a cautel mot be in techinge of children 
in sigt and in lokynge, 
for Þei mot be tauзt to oÞene 
Þe eiene soberliche and cast not Þe eiene to loke nyseliche aboute. 
For pat age is inclined 
to see alle thinges 
for alle thinges 
ben as Þeiз 
it were newe to Þat age. 
Þerfore pat age fondeþ 
to se alle thinges 
and to loke in eche side. 
And pat is fui v T h e G o v e r 
n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s vnsemelich for kynges and princes 
yif þei casten here 
eygen and sight nyseliche aboute, 
for Þerby Þei scholde be holde liзt hedede 
and lowe and feynt herted for it wolde seme pat he wondrede of alle thinges. 
Pan þey Þat scholde be princes and lordes scholde be tauз[t] in childehode of Þe maner of lokyng 
and closing of eigene so pat [Þei] 
oÞene and close here 
eiзene soberliche, 
for a man d o p wel in ful age þynges pat Þei vsen in childhode. 
It is declared how children scholde be taugt in sÞeche, 
sigt and lokyng; 
it is to declarynge 
howÞei scholde be taugt in huyrynge. 
And as it longeth to þis doynge, 
heere mot be double 
cautele:first,touchinge Þe thinges pat ben iherd; 
Þe seconde, touchinge hem 
þat sÞeken Þe thinges. 
And in þynges þat ben iherd 
a cautel is ikept if children 
ben forbode to sÞeke foule thinges. 
For Þe philosofer, 
vii Poleticorum, 
Þer e Þei sÞeken of p i s mater, 
seith pat children 
scholde be forbode to huyre 
eny foule thing 
for huryng 
is nyg Þe doynge. 
Panne as he meneth, 
children schold be forbode to huyre 
eny foule thing forÞerby 
Þei ben sone enclyned to do amys. 
Þe seconde, 
a cautel mot be among children 
touchyng |Þemen pat col. Þei huyren. 
For as it is semeliche pat Þei huyre fayre thinges and honeste and vnsemelich pat Þey heuyre foule thinges and vyle, 
so it is semeliche pat Þei huyre good men 
and honest and Þei scholde be forbode 
Þe huryng of euel sÞekers and vnhonest. Chapter XI 
We hauen iseid tofore pat children scholde be taugt in good maners; 
but for as it is iseid tofore in moral matere 
vniuersal sÞeche profiteÞ luyte, 
it 
n e d e p to teche sÞecialiche how children scholde be taut in good maners. 
Wherfore after we hauen iseid 
how children scholde bere hem in sÞeche, 
in siзt, and lokyng, 
and in huyrynge, 
it is to declarynge 
how Þei scholde bere hem in mete and drynke 
and in dedes of wedlok. 
But first we schal telle 
in how many manere wise children 
may trespase in mete 
and how children scholde bere hem in mete. 
For in mete men and children may trespace in sex manere wise: first, 
if he taketh to feruentliche and hastiliche; 
Þe seconde, 
if Þei taken to moche; 
Þe Þridde, 
if Þei taken in foule manere; 
Þe ferÞe, 
if inordinatliche; 
Þe fifte, 
if to likyngliche oÞer delicatliche; 
Þe sixte, 
if to daungerliche arayed. 
A trespasseth first in mete if Þei taken to feruentliche 
and to hasty­ leche. 
For pat greueth not onlich Þe soule, 
for Þei pat taken m[e]te to feruentliche 
and to hastiliche ben imaad glotons and intemporat, 
but also it greueth Þe body 
for mete itake to feruentliche 
and to hastiliche 
is not wel ichewed, 
and it is Þerfore 
Þe worse deffied. 
For kynde ordeyneþ 
to bestis t e e p , 
pat mete ichewed w i p t e p schulde Þe better B o o k II take worchynge of kynde hete 
and be Þe | sonnere itorned in to nor­ f. isching, 
as wode ihewe and ihacked smale brenneth Þe sonnere 
and turneth in to fuyre. 
And comynliche Þei 
p a t taken mete to feruentliche 
and to hastiliche 
keÞeth not Þ Ì S ordre; 
for as Þe philosofer seith, iii Ethicorum, 
likynge is whanne mete toucheþ Þe tonge, 
but it is more likynge 
whanne it toucheþ Þe þrote. 
Panne Þei p a t taken mete to feruentliche and W I 
Þ gret likynge hauen not gret likynge 
while Þe mete is in mouthe 
but he desireth to haue 
Þe mete sone in Þe p v o t e . 
Þerfore comynliche suche men chewen not þe mete 
but swolwen it vnchewed. 
r Wherfore mete Þat is so itake 
is not wel deffied and greueþ 
Þerfore not oonliche Þe soule 
but also Þe body. 
Þe seconde, 
he trespasseth in mete 
if Þei taken to moche Þerof, 
for Þat greueth þe soule, 
for p a t makeÞ it intemporate and Þe body also, 
for þei letten good degestioun. 
For if mete schal be wel deffied, 
it mot be proporcionat to kynde heete. 
Wherfore if so moche mete is itake 
p a t kynde hete 
may not haue maistrie þerouer, 
it may not wel be deffied and by 
Þ>e consequent folwynge it norisschet not wel. 
Þe Þridde, 
he trespasseth yyf Þei taken mete in foule manere, 
for manye men kunnen vnneÞe o Þ 
e r neuere fede hemself 
nÞeer ete but Þei defoule Þeire clothes. 
And þ e i з bodilich defouling 
be not trespas of itself, 
gut it is trespas 
if it cometh 
of inordinat doynge of Þe soule. 
Panne for foule manere 
of takynge of mete 
is tokene of som glotonye 
and of inordinat doynge | 
of Þe soule 
in takyng of mete, 
we scholde not col. 
onlich be war of takynge to moche but also of foule manere takynge. 
Þe ferþe, 
he trespasseth in takynge of mete 
by inordinat tyme 
as if Þei taken [mete tofo r eÞebou r e oÞe r ] inordinatliche, 
for by suche takynge man is maad glotoun and intemporate 
and also Þe body is igreved. 
For al kynde worchynge is imesured 
by certein durynge of tyme, 
as Þe philosofer meneþ. 
Þerfore it is þat for vsage is as it were Þe oÞer kynde, 
Þerfore if a man is vsed to ete 
in a certein houre, 
comynliche Þei desiren to ete in Þe same hour. 
Panne if a man e t e p inordinatliche 
and in oÞer tyme of Þe day 
þan he is vsed and takeþ 
Þe seconde mete 
ar Þe firste be deffied, 
Þerby Þe body is igreued. 
Panne a man scholde ete in a certeyn hour 
and tyme of Þe day 
not oonliche for goodnesse of Þe soule 
but also for heele of Þe body. 
Þe fifte, 
he trespasseth in mete if Þei han gret desire to haue to likynge 
and delicate mete passynge his owne staat. 
For delicatnesse of mete is itake 
by Þe condiciouns of Þe Þersone 
and by estaat of his gentelnesse. Panne he Þat desireth delicat mete passynge 
Þe condi­ cioun of his Þersone 
and passynge his owne estaat trespasseth, 
for þat cometh of intemporatnesse oÞer of som manere vice. 
Þe sixte, 
Þei trespassen if Þei axen mete to curiousliche araied, 
for in comyn mete and symple a man may be to grete glotoun 
if Þei desiren to haue it to curiousliche arayed. 
For it semeth p a t suche men 
T h e G o v e r 
n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s lyuen for to ete and eten nouз 
t for to lyue, 
for Þei ben to besy to haue here | mete curiousliche isesened and arayed. 
f. 
Now is p i s declared, 
it may sone be knowe how children scholde be tauзt to haue hemself in etynge. 
For no man is sodenliche most parfit, 
it is inow Þat children be tauз 
t litel and litel so 
Þat Þei ben ful tauз 
t whanne Þei comen to ful age 
in what wise Þei scholde bere hemself 
in takyng of mete. 
v Chapter XII 
After Þat we seide in Þe nexte chapitre how me trespasseth aboute mete, 
it is to wetynge 
how me trespasseth aboute drynke. 
For it is iseide tofore 
þat з ong age 
is most inclined to intemporatnesse. 
Panne for alwey most cautels 
scholde be vsed where most Þerei semeth, 
in childhood nedeþ most to be waar p 
a i children be not intemporat. 
And intemporatnesse longeÞ to þre: 
to mete and drynke and lecherie. 
For not onliche mete 
vnÞeweliche itake 
is cause of intemporatnesse 
but also drynke is cause Þerof. 
Panne children scholde not onliche ab­ steyne 
p a i Þei be not glotons 
by takynge of mete, but also Þei scholde be sobre p a i Þei b e not dronke 
in takynge of drynke. 
For wyn itake to moche, 
as it longeþ to p i s doynge, 
doon p r e harmes. 
For Þe more heete is in Þe bodye, 
Þe more he is excited 
to dedes of lecherie. 
And wyn is most cause of heete 
and exciteÞ to incontinence 
if it is itake to moche. 
Panne to greet drynkyng of wyn 
for it meueth to incontinence 
scholde be left 
and forsake more in uthe Þan in elde, 
for ong age is more inclyned to lecherie þan olde age. 
Þe seconde harme p a i comeþ 
of greet drynkyng | 
of wyn is beryng col. doun of reson. 
For whanne fumosite of wyne comeþ 
vp to Þe heed, 
Þe brayn is desturbled; 
and whanne Þe brayn is desturbled, 
oure resoun is apated 
and ilet to dedes þerof, 
for Þanne we may not freliche vse resoun. 
Panne to gret drynkyng of wyn destourbeth Þe vse of resoun, 
for it destourbleth Þe brayn. 
And somme ben more ichaufed with wyne 
p a n oÞer e for here heed 
is more feble 
and here brayn is more des­ turbled. 
Panne children scholde be forbode 
gret drynkyng of wyne for here brayn is feble and sone destourbled with wyn. 
Þe þridde harm 
Þat c o m e p of wyn is debate and strif. 
For whanne Þe brayn 
is desturbled 
by greet drynkynge of wyn 
and vse of resoun ilost, 
Þei breken out sone 
and sÞeken vnsittyng wordes 
and so comeþ debat and strif. 
And for wrathe cometh of hete of Þe blood 
and wyn is hoot and h e t e þ e blood and makeþ 
a man bold and hardy and wrethful, 
and whanne it is so, a man is Þe sonnere imeued to debate and to stryue. 
Panne as Þe philosofer seith, 
ii [Rethor]icorum, 
for children louen stryf, 
Þei scholde be forbode 
to greet drynkyng of wyn 
by Þe whiche Þei b 
e n imeued to debate and to strif. Book II 
Panne in eche age 
it is good to be waar of to grete takynge of mete and of drynke. 
But [for] we vsen Þe better doynges 
þat we hauen ivsed of childhod, 
it is semeliche pat alle fadres 
and namlych kynges and princes be besy aboute 
Þe rewelyng of children 
Þat Þei be so ireweled in child|hood pat Þey be abstynent and sobre. f. 
It is iknowe how children scholde haue hemself 
touchinge mete and drynke 
and it is to wetynge 
how Þey scholde haue hemself 
in seruice of venus 
and in weddyng of wyues. 
For lecherie comeÞ of glotonye 
as Þe dougter of Þe moder. 
Panne as we hauen iseyd pat children 
scholde be tauзt so pat Þei ben not glotons, 
it mot be seid how þei scholde be tauзt 
so pat Þei b e not lecherous. 
Panne for outake matrimonye eche dede of lecherie 
is aзenst resoun 
and Þe fader scholde so be besy aboute children 
pat Þei may be vertuous, 
a child pat scholde be conti­ nent scholde be brougt 
in to holde hym apayed 
with his owne wif. 
And in what age gonge men scholde vse Þe dede of wedloc 
Þe philosofer telleþ, 
vii Polethicorum, 
and seith pat a womman 
scholde be eigte 
and twenty gere oolde 
and a man oon 
and twenty gere oolde. 
For in suche age 
as he meneth ben most parfit children igete. 
But for Þe vertue of generacioun 
is to swithe corupte, 
as we seide tofore, 
it were inow fo[r] gonge men to absteyne hem comynliche fro Þe dede of wedloc 
al here wexenge tyme pat dureth comynliche to Þe oon and tweynty зere. 
For if Þei vsen Þe dede of wedloc wiþinne pat age, 
Þei ben imeued to lecherie 
and here wexinge is ilette 
as Þe philos­ ofer 
m e n e p 
in his bokes of polici. 
Panne Þe dede of wedloc 
scholde be vsed in p i s wise 
if oure vertue concupiscible 
were not to swythe corupt. 
But for it is drede of corupcioun of pat vertue concupiscible 
(that is for to say corrupcioun 
of vile stenkyng caryoun or elles vilþe and concupiscible 
pat is coueitous pat is likyng), 
if children maistres knowen pat Þe chil|dren may not abide so longe tyme, 
‡it may be do col. 
wiÞinne pat tyme 
as hem semeÞ 
pat it is sÞedful. 
And how gonge men scholde bere hem to here 
wyues whan pat Þei ben iwedded 
and what he schal desire in wyues 
Þat he schal wedde we declarede at Þe folle toforeþ 
e rewe treted of rewelyng of wedloc. 
r Chapter XIII 
For it is declared 
how children scholde be abstinent in mete, 
sobre in drynke, 
and temporate in dedes of lecherie, 
and wede wyues in Þewe age, 
and bere hemself manerliche to here wyues whanne Þey ben iwedded, 
it is to wetynge 
how þei scholde haue hem in pleyenge, 
in berynge, 
and in clÞeynge. 
And þe philosofer seith, 
viii Polethicorum, 
pat pley is nedful 
in Þe lif of mankynde. 
And as it longeþ 
to p i s doynge, 
þat may be declared 
by twey weyes: 
Þe firste, 
by voidyng of euel besynesse; 
Þe seconde, 
by getynge of þe ende pat is desired. 
T h e G o v e r 
n a n c e of K i n g s a n d Pr i n c e s Þe firste wey is declared in p i s wise. 
For mannes þ o u t can not be idel, 
þanne whanne a man is idel 
and not occupied in good thinges and likynge, 
anon his thout goþ aboute 
and he thinketh of sum vnlaweful thinges. 
Þerfore, viii Polethicorum, 
Þe philosofer seith pat pley 
is ledyng awey 
and avoydynge of vnlaweful besynesse. 
And for men scholde not be besy 
in vnlaweful thinges 
and also for to put of vnlaweful likynge, 
it is sÞedful som tyme to haue pleyes 
and som likynge laweful and honest. 
And in whiche pleyes and likynge children 
scholde be occupied it 
schal be seid inneremore. 
Þe seconde wey to declare Þe same is itake by getyng of Þe ende 
þat is I desired. 
For a man may not alway haue Þe ende pat he desireth. 
f. Panne for he scholde not 
by continual traueyle faille in pursewyng for to come to Þe ende, 
it is sÞedful to haue sum pleies and likynge among þe besynesse 
pat men may þerby haue som reste and trauaille 
Þe bettere and pursewe for to come to Þe ende. 
Þerfore, viii Poleticor­ um, 
Þe philosofer seith þat for a man 
may not alwey reste in Þe ende 
pat is igete 
and for som tyme desireth an ende and traveilleth long tyme 
ar he come to pat ende, 
þerfore it nedeþ 
to som pleyes 
and som likynge þat Þei faille not in pursewyng 
for to come to pat ende. 
Panne children scholde be so tauзt touchinge pleyes 
p a t Þei b 
e not forbode al manere pleyes, 
but Þei mot haue 
in vse manerliche honest pleyes and liberal. 
But foule pleyes and foule sÞekyng and vnhonest lykynge scholde be forbode children 
as Þe philosofer seith, 
vii Poleticorum. 
For it is iknowe how children scholde haue hemself in pleyes, 
it is to wetyng 
how he schulde haue hemself in beryng; 
and beryng here is icleÞed meuyng of membres and of lymes 
by Þe whiche meuyng disposicion of Þe soule may be know. 
For we seen pat goode men and wise hauin ordinat bering and honest, 
and suche men rewle so here 
lemes pat hauen none mevyng 
by Þe whiche myte be susÞecioun of pruyde or of vnwisdome and folye 
nÞeer of intemporatnesse of apÞetite. 
And lore in beryng 
is nedful to man, 
for man vnderstondeÞ) resoun and hat not suche kynde inclynacioun as bryddes and oÞer beestes 
hauen noþer werchen by kynde inclinacioun 
as bryddes and oÞer e bestes | don. 
For briddis and oÞere bestes pat worchen 
by kynde inclin­ col. acioun 
n e d e p not teching in lore 
as men neden pat vsen resoun and vnderstondyng, 
and is not inclyned 
at Þe fulle 
by kynde to Þew workes and dedes. 
And lore pat scholde be in berynge, 
as we sÞeken here of berynge, 
is pat eche lyme be iordeyned to his owne work; 
for man hureth not w i p his mouthe 
but with his ere. 
Panne it were an idel for to onye 
for to huyre a tale. 
Also a man sÞeketh not w i p feet noþer w i p hondes noÞer with scholdres 
but with mouthe. 
Panne asÞeib e n vntaut in beryng pat 
onet for to huyre 
oÞer men to sÞeke, 
[so] Þei v B o o k II ben vntauзt in berynge pat in sÞekyng streccheÞ hedere and þedere foot and legges 
oÞer casteþ 
Þe armes to swith aboute 
oÞer r e r e p vp Þe scholdres oÞer d o Þ oþer doynges 
pat serueth not to sÞekyng. 
Panne children scholde be so itaught pat Þei haue suche beryng so pat Þei vse meuynge of lemes 
as it serueth to workes 
þet Þei menen 
and to doynge pat Þei doun. 
For som meuynge of lemes 
þat seruen not to Þe work pat scholde be doo comeþ of folye oþer of pruyde oþer of som vice. 
For þis is iknowe, 
it is to tretynge of Þe þridde pat was rehersed in Þe bygynnynge of Þe chapitre ­ 
how children schulde haue hemself in cloÞynge. 
And cloþinge is iordeyned for þre: 
for likynge, profit and worscheÞe; 
for al thing p a t is good is likynge 
oþer profitable 
oÞer honest oþer ‡worschepful. 
And worschepful good is closed in honest good, 
for honest good is Þe Staat of worscheÞe. 
Panne зif cloÞynge 
nedeþ for good pat is lik­ ynge, 
so nedeÞ | hoot clothinge 
to putte of colde 
in Þe wynter tyme f. 
oÞer coold cloþynge 
to putte of heete in somer tyme. 
And if clothes 
n e d e p for worschep, 
so n e d e Þ faire cloþes and gaye. And it is vnseme­ lich 
to be besy to haue nesche clÞeyng and softe for likyng pat isÞer­ inne, 
for Þerby a man is imad intemporate and ferful and falleþ litliche to lecherie 
and to nesschenesse of flesch 
if Þei ben to grete likynge in nasche cloþes. 
For suche semen more wommanliche 
p a n manliche, 
wherfore Þei ben not stedefaste 
but nesche and falleþ sone to lecherie. 
Þe seconde, 
to nesch cloþyng makeþ a man ferful. 
For armure and iren ben som del hard, 
Þerfore he þat vseth alwey nesche clothing 
dredeÞ to take suche thinges 
vppon hym and is imade ferful. 
Panne children, 
and nameliche whanne he comeþ 
to pat a g e in Þe whiche Þei 
ben able to dedes of armes, 
scholde be tauзt to haue not to gret likynge in nesche cloþyng. 
For it is iseid how children 
scholde haue hemself in clothinge 
Þat serueth to likyng, 
it is to declaring how Þei scholde haue hemself in cloþyng 
Þat serueþ to profit. 
And þat is ‡declared 
by a distynccioun 
bytwene hard complex[i]on and nesche; 
forÞei p a t hauen hard com­ plexions 
ben lasse igreued with hete 
and w i p colde p a n Þei pat ben of nesche complexioun. 
And so wymmen, 
for Þei ben more flewmatik 
and hauen thikke complexioun 
and fole of pores and hooles 
as it is iknowe 
by scarsete of here, 
wymmen ben lasse igreued 
‡with hete and w i p cold Þan men. 
Also we | schal distingwe bytwene tymes; 
for in cold col. tyme whanne Þe northerne wynd bloweth 
n e d e p oÞer clothing 
p a n in hoot tyme whanne Þe southerne wynd bloweth. 
Also we maken a distinccioun of ages; 
for eelde, 
by cause pat it hath lasse heete wiÞinne,

r T h e G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s Panne by distinccioun of proprete of tymes, of complexioun, and of age, 
cloþynge mot be dyuers pat serueth for good pat is profitable. 
But as clothinge serueth to good 
þat is worschepful, 
we schal take heede 
of vsage of Þe contray 
and of condicions of Þersones. 
Panne children scholde be so itaught to haue hemself 
in clothinge so patÞeibe not to besy to haue nesche clothing; 
takyng heede ofÞecondicioun of tyme, 
of complexioun, of age, 
of Þe contray, 
and of Þersones, 
he schal vse Þew cloþyng 
for profit of þe body. Chapter X I V 
Hit is not inow to knowe how children scholde haue hemself 
in pleyng and beryng 
and in clothing 
but me mot knowe also 
to what felawsciÞe þei scholde drawe. 
And as it longeþ 
to p i s doyng, 
it semeþ pat children 
hauen foure condic[i]ons by þe 
whiche oure resons 
may be take preuyng pat namelich 
in ong age euel company schold be forsake. First, for children ben nesche and wolle be ilad by oþere; 
þe seconde, 
Þei folwen passions 
and ben inclyned to euel; 
Þe þridde, 
Þei louen to moche here felowes; 
Þe ferþe, 
Þei trowen to sone. 
Pan Þe firste resoun for to declare þat children schuld namelich 
in ong age forsaken schrewed companye 
is itake for pat children ben 
swi})e nesche and ilad by oÞere. 
For comonliche Þe soule folweþ 
Þe complexioun of Þe | bodye; 
for our knowyng bygynneþ of Þe wit f. of felyng, 
and þynges pat ben iknowe by felyng 
ben most iknowe to vs. 
Þerfore comonliche men folwen Þe apÞetite of felyng and Þe apÞetite of felyng 
is a bodilich vertue; 
wherfore suche an apÞetite moot take manere and mesure of Þe body. 
Panne in pat a g e in Þe whiche Þe body 
is most nesche 
and most able to fonge diuerse schapÞes 
and diuerse inclinacioun, 
man is most nesche 
and most able to fonge diuerse schapÞes 
and inclinacioun by apÞetite. 
Panne for nasche thinges and thinges 
pat ben able to fonge diuerse schapÞes 
fongen sone printyng of thinges 
w i p Þe whicheÞeiben iunied, 
and pat sonnere p a n don hard thinges, 
and children and onglynges, forÞeib e n more nesche 
and more able to fonge diuerce schapÞes and pryntes 
p a n men of ful age, 
Þe maners of here felawes ben sonnere iprynted in hem in ong age 
p a n in oÞere a g e - þanne children 
scholde be forbode euel companye. 
(It is to wetynge patÞestwey wordes, mollis and ductilis, 
ben here itak in anoþer manere 
})anne inÞe comyn sÞeche. 
For in Þe comyne sÞeche mollis is nesche and ductilus 
is a thing pat streccheth in le[n]gþe oÞer in brede with betyng of hamers. 
And as we sÞeken heere he pat wiþstondeþ no temptacioun is icleÞed mollis, nesche; 
an[d] he p a t folweþ sone 
oþere menne maneres 
oÞer is ilad by oÞere is icleÞed ductilis.) 
v B o o k II 
Þe seconde wey to preue 
Þe same is itake for ong age 
is most inclyned 
to euel 
and folweþ passions, 
for sone a man is ibrout in to assente to a thing to Þe whiche he is | inclyned. 
Panne for children ben col. 
inclined to euel, 
as we seide Þer 
e we treted of maneres of children, 
it is good to be war of euel companye and namelich in onge age. 
Þe thridde wey to preue 
Þe same is itake for children 
louen frend­ schiÞe to moche. 
For as it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
children ben frendes 
and louen here felawes more þan oÞere of oÞere age, 
for it is ioye 
for hem to be togeders. 
And for þat age loueth principaliche þinges 
þat ben likynge 
and it is ful likynge to be W Í Þ frendes, 
pat age l o u e p t o be in companye 
and to haue frendschiÞe of felawes. 
Panne children scholde be forbode euel companye 
and namelich in ong age, 
for þanne Þei folwen most 
Þe maners of here felawes for Þei louen most to lyue in companye. 
For likyng is whanne thinges 
pat accorden ben ifere, 
þanne no man loueÞ to be in companye 
but he loue to acorde 
w i p his felowes. 
Þe fer Þe wey is itake for children trowen to sone. 
For likynge of felyng 
pat is vnlaweful, 
þow it be symplyche euel 
and to forsakyng, 
ut it may seme good to children. 
Panne for children trowen sone and hauen not parfit vse of resoun, 
Þei ben sone ibrought 
in by here felawes to trowe pat scencible good is to louynge. Chapter X V 
For particular sÞeche is ful profitable in moral matier, 
Þerfore comynge downward particularliche to diuerse tymes 
we schal declare how children scholde be ikepte. 
And first, 
we schal declare how chil­ dren scholde be kept forto 
Þei ben seuen ere olde. 
Þe seconde, 
| how f. forþ. vii Polethicorum, 
Þe philosofer toucheþ sixe pat schal be doun touchinge children inÞefirsteage. 
Þe firste, 
pat Þei scholde be fed 
w i p nesche mete forto he be seuene eere oold so pat Þei ben first ifed with melk. 
Þe seconde, pat Þei drynken non wyn. 
Þe Þridde, 
pat Þei ben ivsed to cold. 
Þe fer Þe, 
pat Þei vse manerliche meuyng 
and pat is prophitable in eche age. 
Þe fifte, 
Þat he be conforted 
w i p 
Þewe pleyes 
and pat me telleÞ hem stories and fables 
in Þe whiche 
Þei may haue confort and likynge, 
and pat nameliche whanne 
Þei bygynnen to vnder­ stonde what men sÞeken. 
Þe sexte, 
pat Þei ben ikept fro wepynge. 
Panne children scholde be ifed 
with nesche mete forto 
Þei ben seuen зeerolde, 
so þat þei benfirstmost ifed with melk. 
For, vii Poleth­ icorum, 
Þe philosofer seith pat moysture of melk semeþ 
most accordyng to bodyes of children. 
Panne in pat tendre age forto 
Þei been aboute seuen ere olde 
Þei scholde be fed 
w i p nesche mete and moyst, 
for suche mete turneþ sone in to norsching. 
Also if children scholde be r T h e G o v e r 
n a n c e o f K i n g s a n d Pr i n c e s fed wiþ 
oþere melk p a n here owne moder, 
þei most haue a womman liche 
to þe moder in complexioun, 
for Þe melk 
is most proporcionat to Þe childe. 
Þe seconde, children scholde not drynke wyne and nameliche 
while Þei souken and, 
as Þe philosofer meneþ, 
pat is for siknesse. 
For chil­ dren taken sone siknesse 
and ben euel disposed in Þe body comynliche if Þei drynken wyn 
while Þei ben ifed wip melke, 
and som menen þat Þei ben desposed to lepre зif Þei vsen to drynke wyn pat tyme. 
Þe Þridde, 
children scholde be vsed to cold. 
Þerfore, vii Pole|ticor­ col. um, 
Þe philosofer seith 
pat it is sÞedful pat smale children ben vsed to cold and pat is profitable for tweyne: first, for heele of Þe body. 
Þer­ fore Þe philosofer seith pat vsyng to cool makeÞe good disposicioun in children 
by cause of heet pat is wiþinne hem. 
Þe seconde, vsynge of children 
to coold is good 
and profitable for dedes of armes. 
For colde fastneÞ 
Þe lymes and membres 
and maken hem sad, 
so pat Þei ben Þe more able to do dedes of armes 
whanne Þei comen to age 
if Þei ben in childhood 
som del ivsed to coo[l]d. 
Þerfore Þe philosofer seith pat 
among somme strange nacions 
it is an vsage to bathe children in cold ryuers for Þei scholde be Þe more stronge. 
But it is to wetynge pat whanne we seyen pat children 
scholde be vsed to p i s oÞer t o pat it schal be vnderstonde manerliche 
and in gre as in condicions of Þer­ sones axenge. 
Þe fer Þe, 
children scholde vse conuenient and temporat meuyng, 
for Þe philosofer seith pat temporat meuynge 
in children ben foure manere goode. 
For it makeþ Þe body 
Þe moore hool; 
for in eche age, 
skilful besynesse and trauele helÞeþ 
for heele of Þe body. 
Þe seconde, 
it makeþ Þe body swift; 
for if children ben not ivsed 
to som manere meuyng in childhood, 
Þei ben slowe and heuy slogardes. 
Þe þridde, 
it helÞed to wexinge of children, 
for temporat and skilful trauele helÞeþ 
to good digestioun 
and makeþ good disposicioun in Þ e body and helÞed 
Þerfore to wexinge. 
For wexinge cometh of mete and drynke, 
and thinges pat maken Þe body wel desposed 
and wel ifed and inoresched helÞeþ to wexinge. 
Þe fer Þe, 
moderat and skilful meuynge maken Þe lemes and membres sad; 
for eche man feleþ in hymsilf pat if Þei | vsen f. T skilful bodylich trauele, his lymes ben Þe more sad and Þe more stronge. 
Panne children þat hauen to tendre lemes scholde be vsed 
to som smale and temporate meuyng to make here lymes stedefast and sadde. 
For, vii Polethicorum, 
Þe philosofer seiþ pat it is sÞedful in children 
to vse som smale meuynges for to vse 
Þe lymes so 
þat Þe lymes faile not for tendernesse. 
For Þe philosofer preiseth so skilful meuynge in children 
pat Þei seien pat fro pat Þei ben first ibore 
Þey scholde be irokked 
and imeued in cradels 
oÞer in som oÞer thinges. 
Þe fifte, children scholde be conforted 
w i Þ som pleyes and som fables. 
For moderat pley accordeÞ to children, 
for in moderat pley is B o o k II 
moderat mevyng and moderat meuyng putteÞ of slouthe and nysete and makeþ 
Þe lymes sweÞere and sweft. 
Also me scholde telle children tales 
and som fables and stories 
whanne Þei can vnderstonde what men sÞeken. 
Also me schole teche hem honest songes. 
For Þei mowe suffre no thing 
pat gr eueþ hem, 
Þerfore it is good to vse hem 
to moderate pleyes 
and to som honest likynge 
þat is not greuous. 
Þe sixte, children schulde be kepte fro wepynge. 
For whanne chil­ dren ben ikept 
f[ro] wepyng þan Þei holden in spirit and breeth; 
for whanne Þei wepiÞ, 
spirit and b r e e p passeÞ out of hem. 
So whan Þey weÞen not, 
Þei holden in spirit and breeth and, 
vii Polethicorum, 
Þe philosofer 
s e i p pat holdyng 
in of spirit and breeÞ makeþ Þe body strong. 
Panne for children scholde be Þe more strong, 
Þei scholde be kept fro wepynge. Chapter X V I 
For we distingwen ages of children 
fro seuen ere | 
to seuene зeere col. and sayen pat Þey scholde be rewled in Þ Ì S wise fortoÞei ben seuen ere olde 
and in pat wise fro seuen ere to fourtene ere, 
and suche tyme of seuene ere may be take lengere oÞer schortere 
by diuersite of Þersones 
for somme ben more stronge of body in fourtene eere Þan Þeere in sextene, 
þanne for in suche doynge 
we may not eue a rewle pat may not chaunge, 
som what mot stonde in Þe maisters doom pat techeth Þe children so pat he may take suche a tyme lasse oþer more as hym semeth pat i[t] is sÞedful. 
And in Þe tyme pat is fro seuen eer to fourtene 
p r e mot be knowe in rewelyng of children. 
For a man isfirstdeparted in body and soule, 
and Þe soule hath vnderstondyng 
and apÞetite 
as principal potencial vertues. 
And p r e mot be knowe in 
children:first,what manere body Þei ben; 
Þe seconde, 
what manere wille; 
Þe Þridde, 
what maner vnder­ stondynge. 
Panne for children scholde haue Þe body wel desposed, 
Þei scholde vse Þewe besynesse 
and Þewe meuynge; 
and to haue Þe wille wel iordeyned, 
Þei scholde be brout in to good vertues 
and in to workes of vertues; 
and for to haue parfit vnderstondyng, 
Þ e i scholde lerne good science. 
Panne science, vertue and besyinesse 
scholde be knowe in rewelyng of children. 
And for to putte of slewthe of children, 
children scholde vse som meuyng 
fro Þe tyme ÞatÞeibenfirstibore. 
But fro Þe tyme patÞeib 
e n seuene зere oolde anon to fourtene ere 
Þei scholde vse strengere and strengere besynesse and traueile. 
| 
And Tacuinnus seith pat bal pleying f. 
is good besynes for children 
and Þe philosofer seith pat wrestlyng 
is good besynesse for children. 
But in Þe seconde seuen зeer 
Þei scholde o vse strongere besynesse p a n in Þe firste seuene ere; 
bot for Þei ben swithe tendre in pat age, 
Þei scholde not vse dedes of armes 
noÞer r T h e G o v e r 
n a n c e o f K i n g s a n d Pr i n c e s passynge stronge workes. 
Þerfore, viii Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer seith pat forto 
Þe heer spryngeth 
in Þe schaar and forto fourtene eer, 
Þei scholde vse liзt besynesse 
and travele lest here wexinge be ilet. It is declared þat for children 
scholde be desposed wel in Þe bodye, 
Þey scholde vse strengere besynesse and trauele in Þe seconde seuene eer þanne in Þe firste seuene ere. 
It is to wetynge how Þei mot be iordeyned to vertues 
so pat here wille be wel desposed. 
Panne it is to wetynge pat, 
v Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer seith pat it is Þe worste of alle if children ben nouзt itaut to holde good lawes. 
For, vii Poleth­ icorum, 
Þei trete whether it is more charge 
and whether is first to chargenge in children 
whether Þei hauen good apÞetite oÞer parfit vnderstondynge. 
And he preueþ pat it is rather to chargyng 
of ordinat wille 
p a n of parfit vnderstondyng. 
Panne in Þe seconde seuen eere, 
for panne children bygynnen to haue fleschliche likynge 
and hauen not parfit vse of resoun, 
it semeþ in pat 
it is to chargynge pat 
Þei hauen good wille 
and wel iordeyned. 
For as in generacioun Þe body is tofore Þe soule, 
for Þe bodi is first ischaÞe 
with lymes and membris and 
})anne Þe soule is idoo þerinne, 
so as Þe philosofer seith, 
vii | col. Poleticorum, 
it is rather to chargyng pat children haue [ o r d e n a t w i l l e pan] witty vnderstondyng. 
And no man hath ordenat wille 
but he haue moderat likynge, 
for in euel ordenance of Þe apÞetite of felynge 
comeþ euel ordinance of Þe wille. 
Panne for fleschliche likynge 
is in Þe bodye 
and good vnderstondynge 
is in Þe soule, 
for in wey of generacioun 
Þe body is tofore Þe soule, 
it is vaÞev to wetyng 
how we may haue moderat lust and likynge and ordinat wille 
})anne how we may haue parfit vnderstondyng. 
And Þe manere in Þe whiche lust and likynge of children scholde be imaad moderat 
is by a sÞecial cautel in thinges pat children desiren comunelich most. 
Panne for children folwen lust and likynge and lieth gladliche and don al here doynges passyng so pat whanne Þei louenÞe[i]louen to moche and whanne Þei bygynnen to play 
Þei playe to moche and so in oÞer e Þei passen alwey mesure, 
þanne Þer mot be a cautel pat Þei folwe not lust and likynge 
but pat Þei be abstinent 
and sobre and pat Þei be not liers 
but soth sayers 
and pat Þei do not alle doynges passyngliche bot pat Þei ben moderate in here workes and dedes. 
Pis is iknowe 
and it is to declaryng 
how Þei scholde be wel disposed in vnderstondynge. 
For whanne we seide pat in Þe seconde seuene eere 
it is more principalliche to chargyng 
of ordinat apÞetite 
p a n of parfite vnderstondyng, 
it schal not be so vnderstonde pat it is in non wyse to chargyng 
how children may haue parfit vnderstondyng. 
But fro seuen eer to fortene eere children 
hauen greet | lust and f. likynge and fayleth 
in vse of reson. 
Þerfore it is more principaliche to chargyng of ordenate apÞetite, 
for as it were by alle Þe seconde seuene eere children lerneþ not but wordes 
for Þei ben not зit so witty to v B o o k II I 
vnderstonde and knowe Þe parfit þynges. 
Þerfore in Þe seconde seuene eer children 
scholde lerne gramer 
pat is a science of wordes, 
and logik pat is more verreyliche 
Þe manere of konnynge 
p a n oÞer e science, 
and Þe p[ra]ct[ik] of musik 
Þat stondeþ in acord of voyce. 
For in pat tyme children faillen Þe vse of resoun 
and mowe not haue parfit cunnynge. 
But for þei scholde not be al vndesposed to science 
whanne Þei comen to vse of resoun, 
Þei scholde Þes artes lerne and sciences of Þe whiche we maken mynde. Chapter XVII 
It is iseide tofore pat toching children 
p r e moste be knowe: 
how Þei scholde haue Þe body wel desposed, 
and Þe apÞetite wel iordeyned, 
and parfit vnderstondyng. 
And we may applie Þes p r e to p r e seuen eres; 
for in Þe firste seuen зere 
after <feth> 
and sacramentз of Holy Cherche 
it is principaliche to chargynge 
how children mowe haue Þe bodye wel desposed. 
In Þe first seuen eere children 
ben as it were wiÞOute vse of reson; 
Þei mowe not wel vse workes of vertues 
noÞer lerne greet science. 
For if Þei mowe ouзt lerne in pat tyme, 
it is comyn langage and sÞeche. 
But fro seuen eere oolde to fourtene, 
for Þei bygynneÞ to haue 
som euel lust and likyng 
and som del vnparfit vse of resoun, 
Þerfore in pat tyme 
it is not oonliche to chargynge 
how Þei mow haue parfit vnder­ stondyng 
but also howe Þei mowe haue apÞetite wel iordeyned. 
For anon to fortene eere | 
as Þe philosofer seith [in] Polethic[is], 
children col. scholde be ilad to good more 
by vse þanne by resoun. 
But fro fourtene eere Þei bygynnen to haue vse of resoun 
and is not oonliche to chargyng 
how Þei mow haue Þe body wel desposed 
and Þe apÞetite wel iordeyned 
but also pat Þei 
b e wyse and redy 
and haue cleer vnder­ stondyng. 
For þanne forward 
Þei mowe lerne not oonliche gramer pat semeth 
as it were a science of wordes, 
oÞer dialetica pat is as it were 
Þe manere of konnyng <of arguyng>, 
o Þ e r Þe pract[ik] of musik pat stondeÞ 
in acord of voyce, 
but Þei mowe lerne Þelke science 
in Þe whiche science 
it is nede to take heede and knowe Þe verrey þynges 
by Þe knowynge 
of Þe whiche thinges 
we may be wise and waar and redy. 
Panne in Þe firste seuen ere 
after Þe fongyng 
of Þe follout and sacramentes 
it is as it were principaliche 
to chargynge of oon 
pat is good disposicioun of Þe body; 
and in Þe seconde seuen ere 
as fro seuen eer to fourtene eer it is as it were principalliche to chargynge of tweyne, of good disposicioun of Þe b o d y 
and of ordeyned apÞetite; 
but in Þe þridde seuen eere 
pat is fro fourtene eere and so forth 
it is to chargynge of p r e , 
of good disposicioun of Þe body, 
of ordeyned apÞetite, 
and of parfit vnderstondyng. 
T h e G o v e r 
n a n c e o f K i n g s a n d Pr i n c e s Good disposicioun of Þe bodye 
in hem 
pat wol lyue politik lif, 
pat is to menynge in comynte and by lawe, scholde fro fourtene ere 
and so forth take more strong besynesse and trauele pan tofore hond fourtene eer. 
For, vii[i]Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer seith p a l anoon to fourtene eere 
|Þeischolde vse esy traveille 
and after fourtene eereÞe[i]scholde f. 
vse more strong traueylle. 
And Þe philosofer seith pat fro fourtene eere forward children 
scholde vse so strong traueille 
pat Þei scholde vse wrastlyng and ridyng 
oÞer som dedes liche to Þe dedes of armes so pat Þei ben in Þe eitene eere lerned and itaut in wrastlyng and rydyng 
and in oÞere dedes of armes and of cheualrie so pat Þei mowe vse traueille of cheualrye. 
For a man is wel desposid 
in his bodi 
whanne his bodi 
is such as nediþ for his office, 
as a knyth is wel des­ posed in his body 
whanne his body 
is suche as nedeþ 
for a knytes office; 
and pat may not be withoute stronge dedes and trauele. 
Panne for alle pat wol haue politik lif in comynte comynne 
and by lawe mot som tyme haue strong traueylle 
for defens of Þe comynte, 
al pat wol lyue suche a lyf scholde, 
fro fourtene ere and so forþ, 
scholde lerne and vse stronge dedes and trauele so pat if tyme come pat comyntee haue nede to defence 
pat here body be so desposed 
pat Þei mowe take suche trauele an honde 
pat Þe comynte may be defended by hem. 
And ho scholde vse suche trauele more 
oÞer lasse it schal be declared in Þe processe; 
and it is inow 
at p i s tyme to knowe pat faders scholde be besy 
to rewle here children 
so pat here body be wel desposed so pat Þei mowe take Þew trauele an honde, 
and pat may wel be namelich зif Þei vsen Þew doynges and dedes. 
For it is iknowe how fadres scholde be besy aboute here children 
for fro fourtene ere 
and so forþ so pat here body be wel desposed, 
it is to wetynge | 
how Þei scholde be besy aboute hem 
so pat here apÞetite col. 
be wel iordeyned. 
And it semeth pat fro fourtene eer 
and so forth children 
trespassen in twey maneres 
by vnordeyned apÞetite. 
Frist, in pruyde; 
for whanne Þei begynnen to haue som deel parfit vse of resoun, 
it semeth hem pat Þei ben worthi 
to be lordes 
and hauen indignacioun 
to be sogette to oÞer e. Þe seconde, 
Þei trespassen in lecherie 
and vnlaweful doynge. 
Panne alwey, 
for by war of greet Þerei nedeþ a cautel, 
fro fourtene eere 
and so forþ children 
scholde be sÞecialliche itaut and iwarned 
to be not prout 
but to be soget 
and obedient 
to here fadres and to here eldere. 
And, vii Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer toucheþ p r e schorte resons whi children scholde be soget 
and obedient 
to here faders 
and to here 
eldere.Þefirsteresoun 
is for faders and eldere commandeþ 
Þe children for here owne good and profit, 
and eche man scholde be obedient to hym pat he woot wel pat commandeþ hym no thyng 
but for his owne good. 
Þe seconde is whan children comeþ to parfit age, 
Þei schollen be lordes. 
Pan Þe while Þey ben in yong age [Þei] scholde be obedyent to r B 
o o k II fadres and eldres for to geue 
oþere ensample to be obedyent and serue hem 
whan Þei comen to ful age. 
Þe p i r d e reson is for he pat wol lerne 
to be a prince 
motfirstelerne 
to be a soget. 
Þerfore Þe philosofer seith pat no man 
is a good prince but he lernefirsteto be suget, 
for noon is good maister 
but he be first a good disciple. 
Panne children for to be good princes 
schul not haue indignacioun 
to be soget to fadres and to eldres. 
Panne Þe apÞetite of children 
scholde befirstireweled in Þe age 
þat we sÞeken of | so p a i Þei be obedient 
to fadres and to eldres. 
f. Þe seconde, 
here apÞetite scholde be rewled 
ÞatÞeivse not vnlawe­ ful lecherie. 
For fro fourtene geer children schulde not oonliche be brout 
in to be abstinent 
and sobre in mete and drynke 
butpatÞeib e also continent and chaast touchinge dedes of lecherie for, 
as it is iseid, 
Þerafter Þei ben more feruentliche excited to lecherie. 
Þerfore Þei scholde be brout in in Þ

For it is declared how in children

‡Here of may come not[e] of þynges pat ben iseid, ii De Anima,

For in rewlyng and gouernance wisdom

For not alwey of Þe vse of wedloc 
c o m e p sones and maales 
but som tyme comen dougtres and femeles, 
after pat we hauen itreted how sones I scholde be irewled, 
it is to tretynge how dougtres scholde be f. ioo rewled. 
But herto nedeþ a schort tretes, 
for whan we treted of rewlyng of wedlok 
and declared how femeles scholde be rewled, 
we declared as it were atte folle 
how dougtres scholde be rewled. 
For as it is semelich pat 
wyues be continent 
and chaast and abstinent and sobre, 
so it is semelich pat dougtres be also. 
Panne Þes condicions 
and many oÞere pat were rehersed of wifes longeþ 
also to dougtres, 
but som what we schal putte more 
tofor good rewlyng of dougtres. 
And first, 
we seyen pat dougtres scholde be ikepte fro strayenge and rennynge aboute and pat we may preue by p r e weyes. 
Þe firste wey is for to 
byneme hem ese and tyme of euel doynge. 
Þe seconde, 
pat Þei be not vnschamefast. 
Þe þridde, 
patÞeibe not strumÞetliche and lecherous. 
For comynliche al men 
ben inclyned to euel 
and wymmen wel more, 
for þei faillen more 
in vse of resoun. 
For it is iseid tofore 
pat oure knowyng comyp of sencible wit 
and sencible thinges 
ben to vs most iknowe, 
Þerfore it is pat comynliche men teilen no prise 
but of sencible good. 
Panne for we hauþ so greet inclinacioun to sencible likynge, 
comynlyche we trespassen 
in suche likynge 
if we hauen ese and tyme þerto. 
Þerfore [in] Rethoric[is] Þe philosofer 
m e n e p pat comynlich men don euele whanne Þei mowe. 
Pan Þe beste cautele to saue and keÞe clennesse and innocence 
is for to forsake ese and tyme of mysdoyng. 
Þerfore in a prouerbe it is iseid pat e s e <makeþ> a Þeef. 
Panne if it is greet 
|Þerilin men pat connen more reson p 
a n wymmen not to forsake col. v T h e G o v e r n a n c e o f K i n g s a n d Pr i n c e s ese of trespace, 
it is wel more 
Þerelle in wommen and зit more in dougtres oþer in wenches. 
Panne for Þei scholde haue noon ese and tyme of mysdoynge, 
Þei scholde be wel ikepte and forbode strayenge and rennynge aboute. 
Þe second wey to preue 
Þe same is for Þei scholde not be vnschame­ fast. 
For thing pat is selde iseye 
is som del schamfastlich, 
for pat is nogt ivsed among men 
schameÞ to come among men. 
Pan a[m]ong oÞer pat maken wenches ‡ schamefast tofore men 
is not vsed to come among men. 
Wherfore whanne wenches strayen and gon aboute by contrees, 
þei vsen to be among men 
and been homeliche with hem, 
and schame­ fastnesse is bynome hem 
by companye of manye men; 
for it is al oon 
to byneme wenches schamefastnesse 
and to byneme hem 
þe bridei 
by þe whiche þei ben withdrawe pat þey do not amys. 
For in wymmen and namelich in gonge wenches faillen resoun 
by Þe whiche Þey scholde be wiÞdrawe 
þat Þei doun not amys, 
þanne it semeþ pat schamefast­ nesse is 
Þe beste bridei of wymmen and namelich of onge wenches to wiÞdrawe hem 
fro schameful dedes and doyng. 
Panne onge wenches scholde be kepte 
fro strayinge and goynge aboute 
pat Þei be not vnschamefast 
and þat þei lese not schamefastnesse 
by Þe whiche Þei ben withdrawe 
fro schameful workes and dedes. 
Þe þridde wey, 
pat Þei be not strumÞettes and gygelottes. 
For if ong wenches ben wel ikepte and iholde 
þat þei go not | 
astraying f. aboute, 
Þei ben not onliche schamefast 
but also hauen þerby a manere wildenesse 
pat is best to saue and keÞe chastite in onge wenches. 
For we seen pat ful wilde beestes 
bycomen tame if Þei vsen to be among men 
so pat Þei soffren men 
to groÞe 
and to touche hem; 
and if Þey comen not among men, 
Þei ben wilde and f l e e p touching 
and com­ panye of men. 
Panne as we seen in oÞere beestes, 
we fynden in wymmen. 
Panneifwymmen strayen not noþer ben vsed to companye of men 
but Þei ben vsed to be out of companye of men 
as wilde bestes, 
þanne hem is Þe lothere to falle to lecherie. 
Panne generalliche alle citeseyns 
and wel more noble men 
and gentil and namelich kynges and princes schulde haue 
Þe more charge of here dougtres 
Þat here dougtres straye nougt and goo aboute, 
for of vnchastite and lecherie of hire dougtres 
may most euel and Þerei falle.

As it is iseid tofore, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
Þe philosofer preyseÞ 
in wymmen loue of besynesse. 
And by þr e weyes we may preue 
pat it is semelich pat alle citeseyns 
and namelich gentil men 
an[d] noble and most principaliche kynges and princes 
ben so besy to rewle here dougtres Þat Þei be not idel, 
but pat here dougtres loue 
to be besy 
in good woork and 
honest.Þefirsteis itake by honoste solace 
Þat cornea Book II Þerof, 
Þe seconde by euel besynesse 
pat is iput of þerby, 
Þe Þridde by good fruyt pat comeþ 
þ e ro f . 
Þefirstewey is declared in p i s wise. 
For, | x Ethicorum, 
Þe philosofer col. m 
e n e p pat oure lyf may not dure wiþoute al manere likynge, 
for to oure lif nedeþ 
som manere likynge. 
Þerfore þey ben iblamed pat menen pat lykyng scholde be forsake. 
Panne for we may not wel dure in p i s lif 
but we haue likynge in som thinges, 
it is semelich p 
a t we vse som goode workes 
and honest in 
Þe whiche we may haue good likyng and honeste. 
Panne for men scholde not be idel, 
Þei scholde vse goode workes 
and honest for to haue likynge þerinne 
and be occupied in cyuyle doynge pat longeþ 
to Þe rewelyng of a regne 
oÞer of hous 
oÞer in som oÞer good workes and honeste. 
Also for wymmen scholde not be idel, 
Þei scholde louye besynesse and doo goode workes and honest, 
for alle men hauen likyng in here owne dedes 
and alle men and wymmen louen here owne workes 
as Þe philosofer 
m e n e p , iiii Ethicorum. 
For wymmen scholde haue likynge and solace 
in som good likynge and honeste, 
it is semelich pat Þei ben ioccupied and besy 
in goode workes and honest; 
and p a t is m o r e sÞedful for wymmen 
p a n for men 
in so moche as wymmen hauen more lacke of resoun 
p a n m e n and cunne not lyue but Þei haue likynge 
in som sencible doynge. 
And what maner workes wymmen scholde vse it schal be declared 
in Þe processe. 
Þe seconde wey for to preue 
Þe.same is itake 
by puttyng of of euel besynesse. 
For comynlich wymmen 
and namliche onge wenches ben at home 
and not ioccupied 
in ciuel d o y n g 
n o Þ e r in r e w l y n g of Þe comynte. 
But manis þouзt 
can not be idel 
as it is iseide tofore, 
anon as man is not occupied in g o o d d o y n g , his thougt passeþ 
aboute and | is f. v occupied in euel workes and doyng. 
And pat is worse in wemmen 
p a n in men 
and in so moche as Þei ben more 
vnstable þan men 
and in so moche as Þei b 
e n sonnere drawe þanne men 
by euel þouзtes to mysdo in dede 
if Þei hauen ese in tyme. 
Þe Þridde wey is itake by good fruyt pat comeþ Þerof. 
For neuere wymmen mow geue hemself 
to goode workes 
but Þer oi come sum good 
and profit of outward work 
oÞer s o m good disposicioun of in­ ward work 
oÞer of Þe soule, 
Þerfore it is besiliche to chargynge 
p a t wymmen ben good and vertuous. 
Þerfore, primo Rethoricorum, 
Þe phi­ losofer dispiseth Lacedemones, 
men of Þe countre 
p a t hatte Lacede­ monia, 
and seith pat Þes men ben nyg vngracious for Þei b 
e not besye how here dougtres scholde be vertuous. 
Panne nedeþ besynesse 
p a t wymmen be not idel 
but pat Þei b e besi in goode workes and honeste so pat Þer of m a y come good fruyt and profit, 
and wymmen may Þerby be good and vertuous. 
And if me axen what workes wymmen scholde worche, 
it nedeþ in suche matiere sÞeke diuersliche 
as Þe Þersones ben dyuerse. 
Wevynge T h e G 
o v e r

and spynnynge of selk semeþ workes of acordynge to wymmen. 
But if a womman scholde lerne in oÞer e gre oÞer in ooÞer state 
so pat Þei schold not do suche werkes, 
oÞer if it were not 
Þe manere of Þe 
contre þat wymmen scholde vse suche workes ­ зit Þei scholde not be idel 
but þei scholde be sette to scole and lerne lettere 
and not be idel 
but Þei scholde be occupied 
in redyng of bookes. 
And here it is declared 
pat we lefte whanne we treted of rewelyng of wedlok, 
for Þere it was iseid pat afterward it scholde be | 
declared what workes col. wymmen scholde worche. Chapter X X I 
It is declared pat gonge wenches scholde not goo astrayng aboute, 
and now it is to declarynge pat Þei scholde be stille 
withoute grete ianglyng; 
and pat we may preue by pre maner weyes. 
Þe firste is itake 
for Þei scholde seme 
Þe more ornate and semelich 
and for Þei scholde be 
Þe more iloued of here housebondis. 
Þe seconde, 
for Þei scholde not sÞeke vnwislich and vnwarlich. 
Þe þridde, 
for <pai suld not be enclined 
to chydyng> 
and <to> stryf. 
Þefirstewey is declared in pis wise. 
For desire is of thyng pat lakkeþ and, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
Þe philosofer seith 
Þe more hard it is to come 
to a thing pat may be had, 
Þe more lacke is þerof and Þe more it meueÞ 
Þe desire to come þerto. 
Panne if a womman is ful of ianglyng, 
sche makeþ hereself 
to hoomeliche and makeþ men telle 
Þe lasse pris of here. 
Þerfore, primo Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer seith pat ornament 
of wymmen is silens; 
for if wymmen ben Þewelich stille, 
for in pat wise 
Þei ben not to hoomliche noþer to companable 
but Þei seme Þe more absent 
and Þe more hard to come to, 
and Þerfore Þei ben not despised 
nÞeer so litel itold of but Þei ben Þe more desired and iloued. 
Panne for eche man semeþ 
pat byng pat he loueth is faire, 
if wymmen ben stille Þei ben þe more iloued and semeþ Þerfore Þe more semeliche and faire. 
Panne fro childhood mayde children schulde lume to be Stil. 
AndifÞeih[a]ue afterward [housebonde], 
here housebonde schal loue hem 
if they bene stille in Þew manere wiþoute to greet iangelyng. 
Þe seconde wey to preue 
Þe same is itake 
by voydynge of vnware sÞekyng. 
For it is iseid tofore | 
pat alwey Þer e most myshapÞe may falle f. nedeþ most to be waar. 
Panne for a man sÞekeþ wisliche and warliche 
by cause of wisdom and of wit, 
Þe more lacke a Þersone hath of resoun 
Þe more it hapÞeth hym to sÞeke vnwarliche. 
Panne for wymmen 
hauen more lacke of vse of resoun 
p a n men and gonge wenches more 
p a n olde wymmen, 
it is soth pat aboute wymmen 
and namlich aboute gong wenches scholde be greet besynesse 
pat Þei sÞeke not vnwar­ liehe. 
And among oÞer e cauteles to be war of vnwar sÞekynge p i s s e m e p Þe gretteste: 
pat Þei sÞeke no word boute besy avisement. 
r B o o k II 
Þe þrickle wey to preue Þe same is itake for Þei scholde not be in­ clined to chydynge and to stryf. 
Whanne wymmen and namlyche 
ong wenches lacken vse of resoun, 
but Þei be stille in Þew manere withoute iangelyng [and] 
but Þei avise hem besyliche what wordes 
Þei scholde sÞeke 
as for Þe defaute of resoun 
Þei mowe sone sÞeke wordes 
pat Þerteynen 
not to honest doynge and to wysdom, 
so Þei mowe sone sÞeke wordes 
Þat Þerteyneth to chydynge and to stryf. 
Panne Þei scholde by Þewe scilence 
so avise hem what Þei sÞeken pat Þei sÞeken not wordes 
by Þe whiche Þei myзt be holde vnwys and vnredy, 
noþser pat Þei sÞeken wordes 
to desturble hem 
Þat ben present by Þe whiche Þei myte 
be holde lewede and scoldys; 
wherfore it is semelich pat Þei ben stille. 
For Þei scholde not sÞeke wordes 
of chidyng and of stryf, 
wymmen scholde principaliche 
be waar of wordes and of strif. 
Panne for besy avisement 
may not stonde 
by greet iange|lynge, 
for col. wymmen scholde fro childhod lerne to sÞeke wise wordes and ware, 
it is semelich pat Þei vse not greet iangelyng; 
but Þei moot be þewliche stille pat Þei mowe besyliche avise hem what Þei scholde sÞeke. 
For after þat Þei bygynnen to chide, 
Þei cunnen not absteyne hem 
for hem lackeþ vse of resoun 
by Þe whiche euel wille and stryf is refrayned. 
Þerfore after pat pat Þei ben imeued and bygynneþ to chide, 
here yuel wel to stryue 
and chide 
is more and more. 
And Þerfore Þei mowe not ben sone refrayned 
for hem lackeþ vse of resoun and lyuen comyn­ liche more

pat an housebonde and a col. 
B o o k II I rewelere of mayne scholde take hede of possessions 
as of hous, of maynye, of araye and stoor of hous, 
and of oÞere thinges 
Þat helÞen at bodilich nede 
and to p i s partie 
in þe whiche it is itreted of rewelyng of seruantes 
and of oÞer 
maynye.Þefirsteresoun is itake 
by suffisaunt lif; 
Þe seconde, 
by liknesse of craft of rewelyng of hous 
and of oÞer e craftes. 
Þefirstewey is declared in p i s wise. 
For craft | of rewelyng of hous 
is f. itaut, 
for an housebonde pat schal wel rewle an hous 
scholde be besy aboute thinges 
pat holden Þe lyf and helÞen to suffisaunt lif; 
wherfore зif hous, possessions and money ben nedful to lyue poletik lif, 
he þat is a rewelere of hous 
scholde take heede of suche thinges. 
Þe seconde wey to preue Þe same, 
as Þe philosofer m e n e p Þe r e, 
is itake by liknesse of craft of rewelyng of hous 
and of oÞer e craftes. 
For as oÞer e craftes 
as smeþes craft and webbe craft 
hauyng here toles and instrumentis 
by Þe whiche Þei doun here workes, 
so rewelyng of hous neden instrumentis 
by Þe whiche it may wel rewle. 
Panne he þat wol teche connynge of smythes craft mot trete of Þe hamer and annefeld 
and of oÞere smethes instrumentes; 
and a smyth moot knowe suche instrumentes. 
So pat he pat wol teche weuyng craft mot trete of Þe l a t h e , 
of Þe s l a y , 
and of Þe heuel, 
and of Þe tredel 
and of oÞer instrumentes 
of þat craft; 
and a webbe mot knowe suche instrumentз. 
Werf ore he pat wol recche of rewelyng of hous 
mot trete of buldyng of possessioun 
and of moneye for suche ben Þe instrumentes of p i s craft. 
Panne he pat reweleþ an hous mot knowe suche thinges, 
for þerby as his owne instrumentes 
he may come to thinges 
pat nedeÞ to suffi­ sant lif. 
For craft of rewelyng of hous 
h a p 
h i s owne instrumentes 
as oÞere craftes of handwerk hauen here owne instrumentes, 
but Þe in­ strumentes ben diuerse 
as Þe philososfer 
m e n e p , primo Poleticorum. 
For instrumentes of rewelyng of hous stondeÞ 
in redy doynge and instrumentes of craft of hondwerk stondeÞ 
in | makyng of thinges. 
For col. in worchinge of hondwork 
we ben irewled by craft, 
and in rewelyng of hous oure rewle is redinesse pat hatte prudencia. 
Panne as craft is oþer þan prudencia, 
so instrumentes of crafti 
hondwork ben oÞer 
e þanne instrumentes of rewelyng of hous. 
And craft and redinesse pat h a t t e prudencia ben diuerse, 
for craft is resoun 
of riзt þynges pat ben imaad; 
for by craft is som what imaad in mater withoute. 
But redinesse pat hatte prudencia 
is riзt resoun of doynge, 
for Þerby is not imaad 
proÞerliche 
in matier withoute 
but Þerof corneþ 
som inward doynge and inward Þerfeccioun in hym pat is rewelere. 
Also instrumentes of crafty hondwerk serueÞ to make thinges, 
for Þei ben instrumentes of craft 
pat is of þinges pat ben imaad; 
but instrumentes of rewelyng of hous serueÞ to redy doyng, 
for Þei ben instrumentis of prudencia 
pat reweleth redy doynge. 
Panne craft [is] of r The G o v e r 
n a n c e of K i n g s a n d Princes rewelyng of hous, 
if it myt be cleÞed craft largelich for to sÞeke; 
but proÞerliche it scholde be cleÞed prudencia. 
By Þe twey forseide resons 
it is declared 
at Þe folle pat rewelers of hous scholde take hede of buldyng 
and of money and of possessions 
pat helÞeþ 
to sauacioun of lif 
and to suffisant lif. 
Also by Þe same resons 
it may be preued 
pat Þe rewelere of hous schulde kunne haue hymself 
wel to seruantes and to mayne, 
for seruantes ben certein instrumentes 
and serueþ 
to Þe rewelyng of hous. 
And so þe firste partie of Þe chapitre is declared 
w<h>ere it was iseid 
Þat Þe rewelere of hous 
scholde take heede of seruan| ‡tes and of thinges 
p a t helÞeth at bodiliehe nede. 
And pat Þes tweye maters [ben] annexed and þat tretyng of buldynge 
and of possessions scholde be annexed to Þe tretes 
in Þe whiche it is itreted of mynstres and of seruantes 
it may be sone iknowe. 
For possessions, hous and moneye ben instrumentes of rewlyng of hous. 
Panne eche seruant is a certeyn instrument 
and eche instrument is a certeine seruant, 
for Þe philosofer seith pat an instrument 
is a certeyne vnsouled seruant 
and a seruant is a certeyn [souled] instrument. 
Panne for an instrument 
and a seruant acordeÞ in p i s wise, 
Þese twey maters ben wel icoupled ifere. 
f. i Chapter II Primo Poleticorum, Þe philosofer makeþ 
a distinccioun of twey membres 
of alle Þe instrumentes 
of rewlyng of hous, 
and seith þat som ben isouled as seruantes 
and som vnsowled as possessioun, money, clofcynge and oþere suche pat serueþ at nede. 
And Þe philosofer seith, primo Poleticorum, 
pat as we seen in Þeere craftes, 
so it mot be in rewelyng of hous. 
And in other craftes 
is Þe double instrument, 
souled and vnsouled. 
As in craft of rewelyng of schip Þe roÞer 
is as it were an vnsouled instrument 
and so is Þe helme and ores, 
and souled instrumentes ben rowers, 
so in rewelyng of hous vnsowled instrumentes 
ben clothinge, beddes, possessioun and money; 
and mynystres and seruantes ben as it were souled instrumentes. 
Panne alle suche instrumentes acordeÞ, 
for eche of hem is possessioun in som wise. 
But Þei ben diuerse, 
for som ben souled 
and som v[n]souled. | col. 
For it is declared how instrumentes [of] rewelyng of hous ben distingwed, 
it is to tretynge how Þei ben iordeyned. 
For Þe philosofer seith pat such instrumentes 
mot ben iordeyned 
ifere so pat on instrument be tofore anoþer 
as Þe instrument with soule 
mot be tofore Þe instrument withoute soule. 
And for company of houses is kyndelich and in kyndelich kynges ‡al kynges ben iordeyned and alwey 
Þe nether ben iserued by Þe ouere and fongeÞ 
of hem manere and mesure, 
also v I I instrumentes of rewlyng of hous 
mot be ordeyned 
so pat Þe nethere instrumentes 
pat ben wifcoute soule be imeued 
and iserued 
by Þe ouere instrumentes 
pat ben with soule. 
And, primo Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer declareth this 
by liknesse of oÞere craftes, 
and seith Þere pat for Þe wrest 
harÞed not by itself 
noÞer combes kymben bi hemself, 
Þerfore for to harÞe Þe wrest nedeþ a seruant to meue it and so 
n e d e p Þe combes for to kembe. 
But as he seith if wrestes harÞen by hemself 
and if kombes kymben by hemself, 
chef craftes men 
n e d e p no mynystres noÞer lordes 
nedede seruantes. 
Þerfore chef craftes men and lordes neden mynystres and seruantes and souled instrumentes, 
for soule[s] instrumentes 
mowe not by hemself 
do Þe office pat 
Þei ben imaad fore. 
For if trestles and met bordes of kynges and of princes were suche as Þe trestles pat were in a certein temple, 
as fables m e n e p , 
for thilke tresteles putte hemself 
to Goddes seruice 
by here owne wille, 
and if alle instrumentes of hous 
were suche as was Dedalus his image 
(of Þe whiche ymage Þe 
philoso|fer reherseth a fable [in] Poletic[is], 
for by itself Þ a t image dede goode workes) 
and if alle instrumentes dede so, 
þanne nedede noon oÞere instrument, 
but mete bordes wolde araye hemself 
and whanne it were tyme gates 
and dores scholde oÞene and close hemself. 
But for it is not so 
but for soule[s] instrumentes 
mowe not meue hemself, 
Þerfore lordes and cheef craftes men nedeþ mynestres and seruantes to moue by here 
rewelyng soules instrumentes and instrumentes 
pat konneþ no resoun to do here workes. 
And it is vnworthi 
by Þe ordre of Þe world 
pat Þe heyeste scholde wiÞoute mene serue Þe lowest, 
but it is Þe lawe of Þe hoole worlde 
pat Þe heigheste serue Þe loweste by mene. 
Þe hey geste pat is in eche doyng ben chef craftes men and lordes 
and Þe lowest ben soules instrumentes, 
and Þe mene ben mynystres and seruantes pat ben 
as it were certein instrumentes. 
And it is not semelich Þat lordes and cheef craftes 
men araye mete bordes by hemself noþer by vscheres noþer porters 
nÞeer oþere suche officers, 
but it is semelich jþat Þei doun suche office 
by mene seruantes. 
Panne in a parfit hous bothe instrumentis ben nedful: souled and soules. 
And how Þei schulde be ordeyned togeders 
it is declared by thinges pat ben iseid, 
for Þe souled scholde be serued 
by Þe soules and agenward 
and be imeued 
to do here owne workes. 
f. i Chapter III 
By Þe forsaide proces 
it may be knowe pat in p i s þridde partie of Þe seconde t is to sÞekynge bothe of seruantes and of thinges 
pat serued to sauacioun | 
of lyf and to suffisant lif; 
and þynges Þat serueÞ col. 
to sauacioun of lif and to suffisant lif ben distingwed a p r e as buldyng, 
r T h e G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P r i n c e s possessioun and money. 
Panne it is to sÞekynge of foure: 
for first, 
it schal be declared 
what manere hous and habitacioun kynges and princes 
and alle citeseyns scholde haue; 
Þe seconde, 
it schal be treted of possessions; 
Þe Þridde, of moneye; 
Þe ferÞe, of seruantes. 
Among oÞere Þat scholde be knowe in buldynge, 
as Paladius seith in libro De Agricultura, 
is crafty work so pat Þe buldynge be craftyliche 
and wel imaad and temporate eyre 
so pat it stonde in good eyre. 
And pat kynges and princes scholde haue wonder hous 
and craftiliche imaad 
Þe philosofer preueþ 
by twey resons. 
Þe firste is itake 
by magnilo ficencia of a kyng. 
Þe seconde, 
by Þe puple; 
and we may putte to Þe þridde resoun, by seruantes and mayne. 
Þe firste is declared in p i s wise, 
iiii Ethicorum, capitulo De 
Magnificencia,Þephilosofer seith pat he 
Þ a t is most glorious and noble scholde be magnificus and kynges and princes scholde be most glorious and noble. 
Panne it is most semelich pat a kyng oÞer a prince be magnificus 
and oÞere pat hauen 
but mene richesse mowe be liberal for liberalite 
may be in mene sÞense and cost. 
But kynges and princes pat haue greet possessioun and richesse scholde be magnifici 
and eche of hem magnificus for magnificencia stondeÞ in greet sÞence and cost. 
But as it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
magnificus scholde make semelich housyng 
and it is not semelich housyng for hym 
þat is magnificus 
but it be wonder|liche and craftyliche imaad. 
Panne by magnificencia of a kyng f. io 
it is preued pat kynges and princes 
scholde haue housynge wonderliche and craftyliche ymaad. 
And oÞere citeseyns scholde haue hous ynge more crafty 
ofÞer lasse crafty accordyng 
to here owne richesse and catel. 
Þe seconde wey to preue 
Þe same is itake by Þe puple, 
and Þe philosofer, vi Poleticorum, 
touched p i s resoun 
and seith Þat a prince scholde make grete workes 
and suche housynge pat Þe puple pat seen it scholde be as it weere astonyed for gret wonder, 
for Þe puple is Þe lothere to arise agenste a prince 
if Þ e i seen pat Þe prynce is so magnificus. 
Magnificus is he pat makeþ greet workes 
and eche of Þe Þeple, 
if Þei seen pat he is so greet magnificus, 
troweþ pat he is so grete pat it is as it were inpossible to ouersette hym, 
and for of thing 
Þ a t is inposcible 
is no choys nother consaille and reed as Þe philosofer 
m e n e p , iii Ethicorum, 
eche of Þe puple 
wiÞdraweÞ hym and dar not make conspiracie agenst 
Þe prince for Þey seen pat he is so greet and so magnificus. 
Þe greet buldyng scholde not be made for boost and veyn glorie, 
gut for Þe puple scholde not telle litel of hem 
it is semelich pat kynges and princes make grete housynge 
as heere astaat axeth. 
Þe þridde wey is itake 
by mayne and seruantes; 
for where moche richesse is, 
Þer ben manye pat eten þerof. 
Pan in hous of kynges and princes mot be manye seruantes; 
þanne not onlich for kynges 
and v I I princes 
but also manye seruantes mowe | 
wel dwelle togedres in hous- col. 
yng of kyng and prynce, 
Þe housyng mot be solempne and greet. 
For it is iknow what manerÞe housyng scholde be touching greet work and craft, 
it is to wetyng 
in what place þei scholde stonde 
to haue good eyre and temporat. 
And Paladius, 
in Þe book of erthe telyng, 
toucheth thre bi Þe whiche we may knowe 
in what eire Þe housynge scholde stonde 
and s e i p first, 
pat in lowe valeys is not holsom 
eire for if housynge stonde in lowe valeys for Þe eire is jsicke by cause of Þe huiles pat stonden aboute 
and is not holsome. 
And we schal imagine in p i s wise pat 
as rennyng water 
is [more] holsom p a n stondyng water, 
for commonliche stondyng water 
wexe thikke and roteÞ, 
so Þe eire closed in valeyes 
‡for it hath not fre meuyng it wexeth thikke Þerfore 
and is not holsom; 
þanne for holsom 
eire me scholde take hede pat 
suche housyng be not ibuld 
in Þe lowest valeys. 
Þe seconde, it is to takynge heede pat Þe place in Þe whiche suche housyng scholde be arered be cleene withoute derkenesse of myst; 
for in som place of Þe erÞe 
by cause of mareys oÞer for som oÞer disposicioun Þe e i r e is ofte iderked by myst and vapores more þanne in Þeere place, 
wherfore Þere Þe eyre is not holsom and Þerfore 
if it may bettre bee suche housynge scholde not be ibuld Þere. 
Þe þridde, 
by Þe whiche good eire is iknowe, 
we scholde take heede of Þe men pat dwellen þerinne, 
and if we wolde bulde in eny place, 
if men wonyen þeraboute we | 
schal take hede of here bodyes, 
if Þei f. i hauen good colour and faire, 
if Þei ben hool withoute heed ache, 
if Þei hauen scharp sigt and good hurynge and cleer voice; 
for by alle Þes goode 
eire is iknowe 
and by Þe contrarie 
vnholsom eire is iknowe. 
For if men pat wonyen Þere ben sike, 
if Þei hauen not good colour 
but olwe colour, 
if Þei hauen heed ache, 
if here sight be desturbled 
and huryng not good 
and Þe voice hoos, 
by alle Þese and by certeyns tokenes and signes†|ofgood eire and clenef. Chapter IV Passynge thes twey - crafty work and temporate eire - tweyne oÞere mot be knowe in buldyng: 
hoolsom water and good disposicioun of Þe world. 
Þe philosofer seith pat water 
is comyn and nedful to Þe lif in meny maner wise. 
Þerfore it nedeÞ to knowe pat housynge scholde stonde so pat it haue water 
inowg good and holsom lest men pat wonyen gerinne take sekenesse for defaute of water 
oÞer by infeccioun þerof. 
And Paladius, 
in libro De Agricultura, 
toucheÞ sexe pat moste be iknowe 
for to knowe hoolsom water. 
Þe firste, pat water come not out of mores 
and mareys and ploddes, 
for comonliche in mores and mareys 
is stondynge water and vnholsom. 
r T h e G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d P 
r i n c e s Þe seconde, 
Þe water scholde not springe out of metal 
nofcer passe by veynes of metal. 
For vnder erÞe ben veynes of metal 
and water is igendred 
vnder erÞe and passe by 
veynes vnder erÞe, 
wherfore if water is igendred 
among veynes of metal and passeth by veynes of metal, 
Þerby þe water is infecte 
and is not ful holsom. 
For it is moyst and nesche 
and aÞeyreth sone 
and is Þerfore sone 
infecte of metal 
and I nameliche of veynes of metal 
where Þe metal 
is not clene and col. 
pure but imedled 
with som roted thinges. 
Þe þridde 
Þat mot be knowe in water 
is pat it be clere and of faire colour, 
for vnparfit colour 
is tokene of inÞerfeccioun of the watir. 
Þe ferÞe, 
pat it haue not euel sauoure 
oÞer euel smel, 
for comynliche euel sauoureo 
Þ e reuel smel of water is tokene pat pat water 
is igendred oÞer passeth by places 
þat ben infecte 
and taken smel and sauoure Þerof. 
Þe fifte, 
pat no slyme be in Þe water 
for slymy ground 
is infecte and Þerfore 
it ne may not be holsom. 
Panne of Þ I 
S fyue fenny maners 
it is to takyng heede in holsom water; 
and for men may be som tyme 
bygyled by Þes signes, 
Paladius bryngeþ forÞ 
Þe sexte singne and tokenynge 
pat we schulde hede of and seith pat we schulde take hede of disposicioun of bodies of hem 
Þat vsen pat water. Pan we schulde take hede 
if here teÞe and tonges ben clene, 
if here heedes be wiþoute ofte hede ache, 
if here wombe oÞer gottes and bowels 
oÞer sides and reynes aken oÞer swellen, 
for ofte alle Þes euels oÞer 
som of hem comen of malis of water. 
Panne housyng schulde be bulde in a place 
Þere it may haue inowg of holsom water 
with Þe condicions of jse whiche we hauen imaad mencioun. 
But if nede dryueth to bulde 
where pat holsom water lacked, 
Paladius seith Þat we schulde make a cisterne, 
as it were a manere deep welle oÞer a put to gadry water 
of reyn þerinne, 
for he seith pat reyn water 
is as it w[ere] best of waters to drynke. 
And in pat cisterne scholde fresch water 
fisch be do pat by here swymmyng Þe stondyng water 
may be meued 
and som del liche to rennyng water. | f. 
For it is iseie 
how housyng schulde be buld touching holsom water, 
it is to wetyng 
how it schulde be ibuld touching Þe ordre of [Þe world]e. 
And as it n e d e p t o bildyng in Þe ordre of Þe world, 
p r e mot be knowe: 
þe condicioun of heuene, diuerse wyndes, 
and disposicioun of groundes. 
And touchinge Þe condicioun of heuene tweyne mote be iknowe; 
first, pat it haue ligt inow in wynter. 
Þe seconde, 
pat it haue not to grete heet in somer, 
and Þat may be if Þe largere side of Þe housynge is toward Þe sone risyng in wynter. 
Panne for it is aforne Þe sonne in wynter, 
it hap ligt ynow. 
And in somer for it stondeþ aslont toward Þe southe, 
Þei scholde haue temporat heete; 
for of a sonne beem pat g o p aslont comeÞ lasse heete þanne of Þe beem pat passeth streigt. 
v o B o o k II I Þe seconde, 
in buldyng of hous 
dyuersete of wynd scholde be iknow, 
and Þat touchyng diuerse chambres. 
For Þe northerne wynd makeÞ Þe eire Þe more pure 
and Þerfore Þe e i r 
e is more holsom. 
Panne by cause of somer tyme 
in Þe whiche men eueleth faste, 
summe chambres scholde be bulde aforne 
Þe northerne wynd 
to keÞe þerinne Þe lif in Þe more heele. 
Þe þridde touching Þe ordre of Þe world, 
Þe disposicioun of grondes 
mot be knowe so pat housynge ben bulde in a place 
pat may be ny erbers and orchardes, 
for sit þerof and wandryng and walkyng gerinne helÞed to gladnesse and to heele. 
And in buldyng of oÞere hous sum 
oÞere thing scholde be iseid, 
as what manere hous 
Þe wyne seler scholde be; 
for he scholde be derk and cold and aforne Þe north and scholde also be feer 
fro waters and cisternes and reueres and fer fro stablees| 
and ovenes and dunge hulles, 
col. 
Also oÞer particuler condicions of housynge myte be distingwed, 
but suche ben to particuler and ben Þerfore iset to Þe avisement of bulders. Chapter V 
It is itreted of housynge 
in Þe ordre 
pat is iseid tofore, 
and it is to tretyng of possessions. 
And by þre weyes we may declare pat possessioun of thinges 
is in som wise kyndelich to 
man.Þefirstewey is itake 
by nede of lif. 
Þe seconde, 
by worthinesse of man. 
Þe þridde, 
by worchynge of kynde. 
if man kyndeliche [l]euen, 
and politik comynte is in som wise kyndeliche to man 
as it is declared in ‡Þefirstepartie of p i s ii book, 
in som wise sum kyndelich thinges 
mot be nedful in politik lif. And, [i] 
Polethicorum,Þe philosofer seith [ p a t p o s s e s s i o u n of p y n g e s is nedful to r e w l y n g o f h o u s , 
if m a n s c h o l d e l y u e i n p o l i t i k m a n e r , 
p a n n e Þerhy h e seith] 
pat possessioun of pynges 
is nedful to Þe lif 
and is in som wise kyndelych. 
Þe seconde wey to preue 
Þe same is itake 
by worthinesse of man. 
For by cause pat among bodilich and sencible creatures of God man 
is most worthi and hath Þerfore 
kynde lordschiÞe ouer oÞer creatures, 
wherfore it is kyndeliche to man 
to haue lordschiÞe 
ouerÞes sencible thinges 
and to haue hem 
to his owne vse and seruyce. 
And for in som wise pat 
is to haue possessioun of hem, 
Þerfore possessioun Þeroî is kyndelich to man. 
And so, primo Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer preueth 
Þat suche possession 
is kyndelich and seith pat men 
hauen kyndeliche ritful 
werre aenst bestes, for bestes scholde be soget to man 
and be iordeined to seruice of man. 
if bestis f l e e p 
Þe seruice of man, 
man fitep and werreÞ 
aenst hem 
as aenst þilke of Þe whiche man 
h a p kynde lordschiÞe. 
Panne in p i s wise man 
h a p kynde lordschiÞe of The G 
o v e r n a n c e of Kings 
a n d Princes beestes, 
and also of oÞere outward kynges. 
And it were not | so 
but f. possessioun of thinges 
were in som wise kyndelich. 
Þe þridde wey is itake by worchinge of kynde. 
For in Þe firste generacioun kynde failleÞ not in beestes 
but arayethe for hem 
Þew norsching, 
it is skilful pat kynde faille hem not whanne Þei ben parfit. 
For parfit thinges ben more worthi p 
a n inparfit 
þynges and kynde ordeynen mete and noresching for hem 
while Þei ben vnparfit, 
þanne moche more Þei scholde ordeyne for hem 
whanne Þei ben parfit. 
For som beestes leggen eyren 
and som bryngen f o r p here 
brood alyue and ful ischaÞe. 
And in beestes pat leggen eyrene 
as in bryddes and foules kynde ordeynen in Þe eyren white and olke so pat of Þe white 
Þe bryd is igendred and ifed w i p Þe olke. 
And so kynde failleÞ not w i p inne Þe schule of Þe 
ei but ordeyneÞ norsching for Þe brydde. 
Also in bestes pat ben igendred withoute eirene, 
kynde failleth not to ordeyne fedyng and norsching. 
For anon kynde is besy 
to ordeyne melk 
in Þe moder papÞes and tyttes pat bestes pat comen forÞ 
may be fed ÞerwiÞ. 
Wherfore if kynde ordeyne norschinge 
to vnparfit beestes and thinges pat 
n e d e p to Þe lif, moche more he ordeyneÞ to parfit beestes. 
Þerfore, primo Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer seith pat outward thinges 
ben ieue to vs by Þe whiche we ben ifed 
and possessioun of outward þynges 
is graunted to vs. 
Panne lordschiÞe of outward thinges 
is som del kyndelich to man 
for kynde bryngeth forÞ sencible thinges

And so we ben Þ

Panne he Þat forsakeÞ suche thinges 
and castefc to lyue 
withoute lordschiÞe of outward thinges 
casteþ not to lyue as a man 
but cheseth heuenliche lif and aboue mankynde; 
as wedloc and getyng of children 
is kyndelich good to man, 
ut som men casten to doo more good and forsaken wedloc. 
And as it is iseid tofore, 
suche lyuen not as men 
noÞer ben partie of a citee 
but Þei chesen hem a lyf aboue men 
and scholde be cleÞed betere p a n men. 
Panne it is kyndelich to man 
in pat pat he is a man 
as Þe philosofer 
m e n e p , primo Poleticorum, 
to haue possessioun and lordschiÞe of oÞere outward thinges 
for suffisant lif. 
Panne as kynde Þeuep lif to man, 
so kynde makeþ beestes, trees and herbes, 
for man scholde haue lordschiÞe and poossessioun Þerof 
and for Þei scholde haue Þew fedyng Þerof withoute 
Þe whiche oure life may not dure. 
r Chapter VI 
It was Þe oppinyoun of Socrates 
and of Plato 
as Þe philosofer reherseth, 
[ii] Poleticorum, 
pat it were good and sÞedful 
to a citee pat citeseyns hadde no propre possessions 
and if alle thinges were comyne to hem; 
and ut worse for Þei wolde pat wyues and children 
B o o k II I scholde be comyne. 
For Socrates and his disciple Plato seide Þatifno man 
hadde his owne propre wif 
but pat eche man scholde take eche womman 
at his owne wille, 
þanne scholde be most vnyte and loue 
in Þe citee for þannie 
alle men wolde loue alle wymmen 
as here owne wyues. 
And also alle men wolde loue al children 
as here owne children for men 
schold not knowe whiche were here owne children, 
as Þe fader scholde not iknowe whiche were here owne children 
but wene pat al children 
were his owne children 
[and] loue al children 
as here | f. owne children. 
In p i s wise Socrates and Plato wolde mene. 
Withinne v Þe Þridde book 
where we schal trete of rewelyng of citees, 
p i s opynyoun schal be more playneliche itreted; 
and here it is inow to wete 
what is to doynge of possession of outward thinges 
in so moche as it helÞeÞ to rewelynge of hous. 
And if men hadde not comynlich corupte 
apÞetite and desire 
and if it were not comonliche inclined to euel, 
it were sÞedful for a citee pat possessions were comyne, 
<for Þe more comyne> 
Þe good is, 
Þe betre it is. 
And Boys seith Þat good pat is imaad comyne is Þe more fayre and cleer. 
But as Þe world stondeþ now, 
it is good for a citee pat citeseins haue here owne propre possessions. 
For cyuel lyf is lif of comyne men and comynliche men 
ben not so parfit pat 
Þei wolde be apayed to lyue suche a lif. 
And of diuers place [in libro] Poleticorum we may take p r e by Þe whiche we may declare 
by p r e weyes 
Þat it is sÞedful 
to a cite pat citeseins haue here owne propre possessions. 
Þe firste wey is itake for to putte away vncurtesie, 
Þe seconde to putte away strif, 
Þe þridde to putte away euel ordinnaunce 
and schindynge of Þe citee. 
Þefirstewey is itake in p i s wise. 
For man l o u e p hymself so moche pat he careth alwey more 
for his owne profitþeannefor oÞere menne profit. 
For we seen pat in pat wise possessioun 
mygte be sone de stroyed and wasted, 
and it is so hard to trauele 
and to gete proÞer possessioun 
by proÞer wynnynge pat in Þe citee many mygt hapÞe be nedy and pore not withstondynge 
pat citeseins mowe haue here owne possessions 
and ben besy þeraboute as aboute here owne good. 
Panne if Þ e i hadde not | 
here owne proÞer possessioun 
but al in comyn, 
for col. citeseyns wolde not be so besy to gadre comyne possessions 
as Þei ben comynliche to gadery here owne, 
Þe cite pat were so iordeyned 
mygt falle in pouerte and nede so pat citeseins mygt nougt be suffisaunt 
to hemself in leuynge. 
Pan what is not good and profitable alwey is good and profitable in som caas. 
Pan as Þe worlde stondeþ now, 
it is gode to a citee pat citeseins haue here owne propre possessions ‡ lest comyne hous of citeseyns falle in pouerte and nede 
by vncurtesie and slewjse. 
Þe seconde wey for to preue 
Þe same is itake by remeuyng of strif. 
For comynlich Þere is strif and werre bytwene hem 
pat ben partiners and hauen ougt in comyn. 
And we seen pat twey breþerne of oo fader, 
The G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d Princes bytwene 
Þe whiche is kynde loue and frendschiÞe 
as Þe philosofer seith, viii Ethicorum, comynlichefigtenfor here comyn heritage. 
Panne moche more strif scholde be among citeseins bytwene 
Þe whiche is not so 
grete frendschiÞe 
if possessions were comyn to hym. 
Þe Þridde wey is itake 
by remeuynge of inordinate doynge and confusioun. 
For, ii Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer seith 
if citeseins hadde possessions in comyne, 
it scholde fare as it fareth 
whanne a certeyne doyng 
is commytted to manye seruantes. 
For whanne it is so, 
eche of hem wiÞdraweÞ hym 
and d o p not 
as he is ihoot hopynge pat another d o p it. 
Þerfore pat thing is not ido 
oÞer it is vnordinatliche ido oÞer wip confusioun. 
Panne for to do awey confusioun 
and inordinat doynge in thinges 
Þat ben sÞedful to a citee, 
it is good pat citeseins haue here owne possessions 
pat feeldes and oÞere londes pat b e r e p fruyt may be tyled 
Þe more bysiliche 
and Þe more ordenatliche | 
and wijsoute strif. 
f. r Chapter VII Primo Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer declareth pat of diuerse vse of outward thinges 
cometh diuers manere of lyuynge. 
For as we seen in beestes 
pat not alle beestes vsen Þe same kynges 
nÞeer alle beestes hauen 
Þe same maner of leuyng and so it fareth among men. 
For som bestes lyuen by herbes, 
sum by apples oÞer by fruyt, 
and sum by raueyne. 
Þerfore bestes hauen diuerse manere of lyuynge; 
for as Þe philosofer meneÞ somme lyueÞ agalya, 
pat is to menyng in companye, 
and som by hemself 
and out of companye. 
For alle manere beestes lyuen 
as it is most sÞedful 
to suffisant lyuynge 
and as Þei mowe best gete mete and norisching. 
And also men v s e p outward þynges dyuerseliche 
and not alle men hauen Þe same manere of leuyng. 
Primo Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer distingweth foure manere of symple leuyng 
of Þe whiche by combinacioun comen Þeere maneres of leuynge. 
For Þer is foure manere of leuynge, 
for som men leuen 
by erÞe telyng 
and by tame beestes 
and suche manere of leuyng 
is icleÞed vita pascualis. 
And som man lyueÞ by huntynge 
and by wilde bestes; 
[and summe lyuen by 
fyschyng;] and summe lyuen by raueyne and by Þefte. 
And p i s manere of leuynge 
may be combyned togedres 
so pat a man may haue twey maners of leuyng oÞer mo. 
For som men leuen by erÞe tylynge 
and by huntynge, 
and sum by erÞe tylynge and by fyschyng, 
and sum by huntynge 
and by raueyne 
and by Þefte. 
And somme vsen al manere of leuynge 
for som men lyuen 
by e r Þ e telynge 
and by tame beestes, 
byfischingand by huntyng 
and by raueyne. 
And of p i s foure | manere of leuynge, 
col. [leuynge] by raueyne 
is vnlaweful 
at al and Þe 
oÞere maneres of leuyng mowe be laweful. 
B o o k II I 
For leuyng by erþe telyng 
and by tame beestes 
as by scheep and oxene 
and oÞere suche 
is laweful 
for kynde ordeyneþ hem for Þe vse of mankynde. 
For alwaye lasse parfit 
ben iordeyned for þe more par[fit]; 
as water and erÞe [pat] 
ben soules ben iordeyned 
for norischyng of treen, 
herbes and gras 
as Þe lasse parfit iordeyned for Þe more parfit. 
And treen, herbes and gras 
pat hauen no felyng ben iordeyned 
for norisching of beestes pat hauen felyng; 
and al Þese pat ben soules, 
and alle Þat hauen soule 
and no felynge, 
and beestes pat hauen soule 
and felynge ben iordeyned for sustinaunce of man. 
Þerfore it is wel iseide, primo Poleticorum, 
pat kynde eueþ vs suche thinges, 
for kynde ordeyneth hem to oure vse 
and to oure lordschiÞe. 
Panne it is laweful 
to take norsching of feldes 
[and] of tame bestes, 
wherfore leuynge 
by erÞe telynge 
and by tame bestes is laweful. 
And leuyng of huntynge andfischyngeis not vnlaweful 
by kynde Þ>erof, 
for by kynde man scholde be lord 
not onlich of tame bestes 
but also of wilde bestes and of fische, 
and man h a p aenst suche ritful werre. 
Þerfore, primo Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer seith pat leuynge 
by huntyng and fisching is laweful, 
for he seith pat man 
h a p ritful werre 
aenst suche beestes. 
And for to sÞeke onliche of Þe kynde þerof, 
men mowe take suche beestes 
and ordeyne hem 
to here owne vse. 
And for to sÞeke of kynde of raueyne, 
leuynge by raueyns is vnlaweful, 
for men hauen not by kynde ritful werre aenst men. 
But if men hauen ritful werre aenst men, 
it is | for som hapÞe 
and for som men 
f. doun o Þ e r wrong. 
Pan a man d o p wrong 
if he greueÞ a man 
by euel trespace; 
and for to sÞeke of Þe kynde of doing, 
‡man doÞ not wrong 
in greuyng of bestes. 
And if wrong is in greuinge of bestes, 
pat is bi hap, 
for such greef turnith sum man 
to harme pat owiÞ Þe bestis. 
But it semeþ pat Þe philosofer wolde mene 
that a man hath ritfulle werre nout oonliche aenste bestys 
bute also aenste straunge men 
pat ben icalled barbari, 
Þat is a stronge nacioun 
and ben as Þei it were wilde men. 
And hem lakken vse of resoun 
and scholde Þerfore be soget 
to wis men and redy. 
And it semeth pat h e wolde mene pat for wise men 
scholde be kyndelich lordes 
of nyse men and foles, w[er]re is ritful aenst hem 
if Þei wollen not be soget to wise men and redy. 
And by Þ I S manere of sÞekyng citeseyns 
pat ben ful wise and redy hauen ritful werre aenst cherles 
if þei wollen not be sogettes to hem. 
Þerfore aenst suche pat wollen not be soget 
as Þei scholde, 
by Þe menynge of Þe philosofer, 
vnderstondeþ in Þ I S wise: 
it semeþ pat leuyng 
by raueyne is laweful so pat it were laweful 
not onliche to spoille hem 
and byneme hem 
what Þei hauen 
but also to take hem in here owne Þersone. But for no man scholde haue wrong for to sÞeke of kynde of raueyne, 
leuyng by raveyne is acounted vnlaweful for a man scholde lyue 
by his owne 
and not byneme oÞer menne good. 
v The G o v e r n a n c e of Kings 
a n d Princes Panne for citeseyns 
and nameliche for kynges and princes 
schulde lyue vertuous lif, 
if Þei wollen rewle here owne hous, 
[Þei] scholde knowe Þe maneres of leuynge 
and whiche Þerof is laweful 
and whiche is vnlaweful. 
For no man may lyue vertuousliche 
if | he vseth vnlawe- col. fulliche possessions and outward good. Chapter VIII Comunelich men trespassen in apÞetite and desire 
and in coueitise of possessions and of richesse, 
for comynlych men hauen neuere so moche richesse 
bot gut Þei wolde haue more. 
And, primo Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer assigneth double cause 
whi coueitise of richesse is endeles. 
Þe firste is itake 
by inordinat wille; 
Þe seconde, 
by fals estimacioun oiÞe ende. 
Þe firste wey is declared in p i s wise. 
For as he seith, 
couetise of richesse is endeles 
and Þe cause herof 
is for men ben besy to lyue and not to lyue wel. 
For al fÞat desiren richesse for to leue wel and for to helÞe 
Þe body desiren not endeles richesse; 
and al pat lyuen wel lyuen vertuousliche. 
And for men reccheþ 
not to lyue vertuousliche 
but al here besynesse 
is how Þei mow lyue 
in lust and likynge of body - 
for it semeth pat richesse 
helÞed most þerto, 
for to come by richesse to Þyng 
pat he coueyteþ and desireÞ eche man desireÞ richesse - 
and for to haue 
Þe bettre here purpos, 
men desiren richesse and hauen neuer inow Þeroi. 
Þe seconde wey for to preue Þe same is itake 
by fals estimacioun of Þe ende. 
For as Þe philosofer distingweth, primo Poleticorum, 
and as we seide 
at Þe fulle in Þe firste book, 
Þe ende and thinges pat ben iordeyned 
for Þe ende ben diuersliche desired. 
For Þe ende is endeles desireth, 
and þynges Þat ben iordeyned 
for Þe ende ben desired 
in manere and mesure of pat ende; 
as if Þe endes of phisician 
is to hele Þe sike man, 
Þ e fisician may neuere maken hym so hole 
pat he nolde make hym more hole 
if pat he mygte. 
For Þe phisician coueiteÞ 
as it were to | make endeles helÞe, 
but he g e u e Þ drynches 
by Þe manere and mesure of Þe helthe. 
Panne comynliche men hauen false trowynge of Þe ende and trowen 
þat it scholde be sette in richesse 
and desyreth endeles richesse. 
But to rewelyng of hous 
it longed not to coueyte endeles richesse 
and þat we may preue 
by twey weyes. 
Þe firste is itake 
by liknesse pat craft of housbondrye 
and of rewelyng of hous hauen to kynde, 
Þe seconde by likenesse pat craft of rewelyng of hous haÞ to Þeere craftes. 
Þefirstewey is declared in Þis wise. 
For we seen Þat kynde is not besy 
to ordeyne endeles moche norsching 
but kynde ordeyneÞ 
onliche so moche norsching 
as nedeþ to Þe beste pat schal be norsched; 
as if kynde gendreþ 
a brid of Þe white of Þe ney, 
and f e d e p hym with Þe f. r Book II I golke, 
kynde ordeyneÞ not in Þe eye endeles moche golke 
but onlich so moche 
as suffiseth to fede þe bryd. 
Also of menstruale blood 
kynde makeþ a beest; 
and while Þe beest is ifed w i p melke, 
kynde ordeyneÞ not in bestes endeles moche melk 
but onlich so moche 
as suffiseth to fede 
Þe beest pat is igendred. 
Panne for richesse 
is iordeyned 
for fedyng and norsching 
and for suffisant lif, 
as Þe golke in an ey 
is iordeyned 
for to fede Þe bryd, 
and mylk in oddernes, 
papÞes and tettes for to fede 
Þe gonge beste, 
git he pat is rewelere of hous 
wol not do agenst kynde 
but he wol rewle his hous 
by manere and ordre of kynde. 
He scholde not gete nother coueyte endeles greet richesse and possessioun; 
but whanne he h a p so moche as hym nedeþ 
for his staat to rewelyng of hous, 
he scholde hoolde hym apaied þerwith. 
Þe seconde wey is itake by 
lik|nesse pat is bytwene 
Þe craft of rewel- col. 
yng of hous and oÞer craftes. 
For possessions bien Þe instrumentes of Þe craft of rewlyng of hous, 
as annefeld and hamers 
and oÞere suche ben instrumentes of smythes craft. 
And as Þe philosofer seith, primo Poleticorum, 
no craft hath endeles manye instrumentes. 
Panne nÞeer craft of rewelyng of hous 
scholde desire endeles maynye possessions. 
Panne alle citeseyns 
and namelich kynges and princes scholde be apaied 
w i p so greet richesse and possessioun as nedeÞ 
for here astaat, 
for coueitise of endeles greet richesse 
as it is ipreued 
c o m e p of false trowynge of Þe ende oÞer of inordinat wille. 
Panne pat is worse in kynges and in princes p 
a n in Þeere men 
by so moche as kynges and princes 
scholde haue ordinat wille 
and good trowynge of Þe ende passynge oÞere men. 
For as it was iseid inÞefirstebook, 
it is worse in a kyng to haue fals trowyng of Þe ende p a n in Þe puple, 
for Þe puple 
is ireweled by Þe kyng, 
as it is worse if Þe archers knowen not Þ e marke Þan it is Þei Þe a r w e knowe not Þe mark, 
for Þe archere rewleþ Þe arwe. Chapter IX 
if Þe philosofers wordes, primo Poleticorum, 
ben iknowe, 
alle chaungynges of byggynge and sellynge ben reducte and ibrogt to p r e manere changynges. 
OonÞerof is of changynge of thinges for thinges, 
as chaungynge of whete for wyne oÞer for barliche oÞer for oÞer thinges 
pat helÞen at bodilich nede. 
Þe oÞer is chaungyng of kynges for money and agenward. 
Þe þridde is chaungynge of moneye for moneye, 
as whanne moneye of siluer 
is chaunged for moneye | of gold f. 
[oþcer agenward, 
oÞer] for money of oon land 
is changed for money of anoþer lond. 
Panne for to wete how it nedeÞ to brynge 
in suche chaungynges 
it is to wetyng 
Þat if Þer w e r 
e no comynte bot comynte of hous pat is Þe firste cominte, 
no chaungynge of byggyng 
and sillynge were nedful. 
v The G o v e r 
n a n c e of K i n g s a n d Princes 
For in hous Þe housebonde is lord 
and to hym it longeÞ to ordeyne for al pat ben in Þe hous, 
wherfore al changyng 
pat is imad to meyntene 
Þe hous is imaad by Þe housebonde 
(in his owne Þersone oÞer by mene procuratours), 
for to Þe housebonde it longeþ to releue al Þe nede of Þe hous. 
But no thing is ichaunged for itself 
n o Þ e r ibougt nofcer isolde, 
also no man changeÞ 
with hymself noþer siileÞ 
to hymselue noþer byeth of hymself. 
Panne it is wel iseid, primo Poleticorum, 
pat in Þe firste comynte pat is an hous 
nedeÞ no suche changynge. 
Panne for oÞere comyntees 
such chaungyng was ibrougt inne. 
And Þer ben oÞere comyntees 
p a n hous, 
as comynte of strete and of cite 
and of al Þe regne and prouince 
oÞer of diuers regnes 
and of diuerse prouinces. 
For sum tyme bynges pat 
n e d e p t 
o Þe lif ben not ifounde in al Þe regne, 
Þerfore it nedeÞ pat sum men passe 
in to diuerse contrees of Þe worlde 
as in to diuers regnes and regions and prouinces 
for to gete spicerie and oÞere thinges pat n e d e p t o Þe lif. 
For bi cause of diuerse 
asÞecte of sterres and of pianettes, 
in som hoot contrées 
is piente of thinges of Þe whiche 
is no piente 
in colde contrees and agenward; 
and Þerfore by cause pat men mote comyne wip oÞere not oonliche of oo strete oÞer of | oon citee oÞer of on prouince 
but also w i p men of col. diuerse prouinces 
and of diuerse regnes, 
and Þerfore Þes forseide p r e maneres of chaungynges 
ben ibrou[g]th in. 
For Þey t o Þe comynte of a strete oÞer of a citee chaungyng of thinges for thinges 
mygte suffise in som wise, 
gut to Þe comunycacioun pat is in al Þe r e g n e it 
n e d e p t o haue changynge of kynges for money and agenward. 
Also Þei in comunicacioun of al Þe rewme changynge 
of kynges for money [mygte suffise] and agenward, 
‡ git in comunicacioun pat 
is in diuerse regnes and prouinces it 
nedeÞ to haue not onliche changynge 
of þynges for money 
but also of money for money. 
For as Þe philosofer m e n e p , primo Poleticorum, 
in oolde tyme men lyuede symplyche 
and changed 
as it were oonliche thinges for thinges, 
as if oon hadde moche wyne 
and anoÞer moche whete, 
he changed wyne for whete 
and meynteyned suffisant lif 
by suche chaungyng. 
And p i s manere 
as he seith was gut ivsed 
among manye strange naciouns pat vsede no money 
but chaungede onlich thinges for thinges. 
And oon caas p i s mygte be vsed in strete oÞer in oon toun 
and in oon citee; 
but in alle a regne oÞer 
in al a prouince pat i s long and brood pis vsage mygte not wel be holde. 
For wyn and whete and Þeere suche thinges 
pat vs nedeÞ to Þe lif ben ful heuye and mowe not 
Þerfore be bore 
in to feer contrees, 
Þanne it nedeÞ to haue som what pat may wel be bore 
and is faire and profitable for Þe whiche we may haue mete and drynke. 
And namelich gold 
oÞer siluer is suche, 
for among metals gold and syluer ben fairest and most profitable and worschepful for Þerof may vessel be maad 
that ben profitable for men. 
And he pat vseth suche vessel is acounted in worschip | and honour. 
f. r B o o k II I Pannefirstsuche chaungyng of byenge and sellynge was chaungyng of thinges for metal 
onliche by Þe wit, 
as he pat wol haue so moche wyne scholde eue so moche wit of siluer oÞer of gold 
oÞer of oÞer metal 
as Þe puple and kynges wolde ordeyne in pat tyme. 
But for it was hard in eche byggyng and sellyng 
to haue alwey euene wites of metal, 
to descharge byers and sellers 
of suche weyenge and wites, 
in Þe same metal was iwrete som prynte and tokene 
as an image of a prince oÞer som oÞer printe and tokene 
Þat was iknowe by Þe 
whiche it myte be knowe 
of what wit and of what valewe pat metal scholde bee. 
Panne in p i s wise moneye was ibrout in þat is as it were oure borowe for Þe whiche we may fonge anon 
by Þe valew what nedeÞ to oure liflode. 
Panne in al oon regne, 
for men þerof scholde not be 
to swithe igreued, 
for whanne Þei scholde go out of Þe 
o syde of Þe regne 
to anÞeer most bere wip hem charges of mete and drynke, 
for to putte of pat greef money 
was ifounde pat may esiliche be ibore, 
and in chaungyng Þerof weyfaryng 
men may haue mete and drynke 
and oÞere thing pat hem nedeÞ. 
Wherfore on cas chaungyng 
of þynges for money 
and aenward myte suffice in o regne oÞer in oon prouince, 
but for in diuerse regnes 
ben diuerse lordes 
and vsen not alle o maner money, 
men pat wonyen in dyuerse londes 
al withoute changyng of thinges for thinges 
oÞer of fingis for 
m[one]y n e d e p to haue chaungyng of money for money. 
Panne it is declared how manye manere chaungynges 
Þer b e n of | col. 
byggyng and sellyng 
and how Þei ben ifounde 
and what nede it was to brynge in money. 
Panne a wise housebonde 
and a redy rewelere of hous scholde knowe how suche chaungynges come 
vp and where of heseruefþpat 
he may 
by suche knowyng kunne ordeyne Þe betere for his hous. Chapter X 
After Þe tretes of possessions 
it is skylful to trete of money, 
for wyne and corn is kyndelich richesse, 
and moneye is craftiliche richesse, 
[as Þe philosopher seith, primo Poleticorum]. 
Panne for craft is deÞendant of kynde 
and where Þe worching of kynde 
e n d e p Þere worchynge of craft bygynneÞ, 
after Þe tretes of possessions of Þe whiche comeÞ kyndeliche richesse 
it is skylful to trete of money 
pat is craftiliche richesse. 
Panne if after possessions 
it is to tretyng of money, 
after pat w e s e i d 
e what nede it was to fynde money, 
it is to sÞekynge how many maners 
Þer ben of money. 
And [in] Poletic[is] Þe philosofer distingueth foure maners of money 
pat ben icleÞed by hym naturalis, campsoria, obolostatica, takos (pat is vsurie). 
In p i s foure manere wise men 
were iwont to haue moche money. 
The G o v e r n a n c e of Kings 
a n d Princes Panne Þe firste manere of p i s money 
is icleÞed 
as it were naturalis, kyndelich money, 
and is igete by chaungynge of kyndelich thinges for money. 
Pan if a man haue moche wyne and corn pat groweÞ kyndeliche and fongeÞ money, 
Þerfore pat money is icleÞed 
as it were kyndelich moneye 
for it is ifonge for kyndeliche kynges. 
Þe seconde manere of moneye 
is icleÞede camsoria, 
as it were money of chaungyng. 
And, primo Poleticorum, 
Þe philosofer seith pat on caas 
p i s money was i|founde by hapÞe 
and †not sympliche†and f. i is afterward 
by exÞerience imaad craftiliche moneye, 
for to sÞeke of moneye 
in itsilf eche maner money 
is most worthi 
in his owne londe. 
But it hapÞed som tyme pat 
in som lond sum 
man hath money 
pat is litel worthi in pat londe 
for it is not money of pat londe. 
Panne it hapÞede 
pat he wente with pat money 
and passe in to Þe lond of Þe whiche pat was Þe money and fenge Þe more for pat money 
})anne it is worthi 
in his owne lond and for suche doynge men 
vsen changyng of money 
and of p i s hapÞe comeÞ craft of chaungyng of money 
so pat afterward men taken heede what money is worthi 
in diuerse londes 
and in what londe what money is best. 
And so by craft comeþ forth chaungynge of money 
by cause of wynnynge. 
And p i s money schal not be cleÞed kyndelich money for it 
bygynneþ not at kyndelich thinges 
noÞer endeÞ at kyndeliche thinges. 
But in p i s craft 
as Þe philosofer seith, primo Poleticorum, 
money is Þe bygynnynge and ende for Þe craft bygynneÞ at money 
pat he eueth and endeÞ at money 
pat he fongeÞ and so 
Þere money is icleÞed 
bygynnyng and ende. 
Þe Þ r i d d e manere of money [is] 
obolostatica and pat is to menynge passynge wit 
oÞir Þeise 
and was ifounde in p i s wise: 
for as moneye is imaad 
of a gadde of metal 
and h a p a comynte prynte and signe, 
and sum tyme for certeyne nede as for to make vessel oÞer for som oÞer thinges, 
of money is imaad a gad of metal 
and som tyme of so manye Þenyis is a gad imaad of more wight 
p a n s o m a n y 
Þeny|es scholde col. weye. 
And Þerof comeÞ Þe craft pat alle pans scholde be iweye 
and Þe heuyest pans 
and most of Þeyse scholde be molte 
and a gad of metal imaad Þerof for to haue wynnyng Þerby. 
Panne Þe craft obolastatica, 
passyng wit and Þeise, 
comeÞ of passyng wit and Þeyse of money 
as it were wynnynge by Þeyse money. 
Þe ferÞe manere of money hatte takos and pat word 
is to menyng b u r Þ e and gendryng. 
For it semeth pat p i s craft wolde gendre and conceyue and brynge forÞ money 
and we cleÞen comynliche p i s craft vsura for neuere thinges 
encresen in hemself 
but by generacioun, 
concepcioun and burþe. 
Asifa man hap ten scheep 
at Þe bygynnynge and twenty at Þe Þeres ende pat is for Þe scheep gendreth and enyeth. 
Panne if a man wol of ten pans haue 
after a certeyn tyme twenty pat money 
is icleÞed vsuraria as it were money igete by vserye 
as it is dediche iknowe suche a man wolde pat p i s money scholde gendre v B o o k II I (eny oÞer caluy) 
and brede more moneye. 
Panne vsura is ritful icleÞed burÞe and bredyng of money. [In] Poletic[is] Þe philosofer seith þat of Þ I 
S foure maneres of money 
oonlicheÞe firste is kyndeliche 
and is igete 
as it were by housbondrye. 
And by hym Þe oÞer p r 
e ben to blamynge, 
for al craft pat bygynneÞ 
at money and endejs at money setteÞ Þe ende in money as it semeth. 
Panne campsoria, 
pat is iwonne by chaunchyng of money, 
and obolastatica, 
pat is iwonne by passynge of wigt 
and of Þeise of moneye, 
and vsura, 
for | hestondefþas 
it were al in money, 
for Þei bygynnen at mon- f. 
ey and endeþ at money 
Þei ben Þerfore to blame, 
for Þe philosofer seith pat a man 
is to coueitous of money 
if al his workes 
bygynnen at money 
and e n d e Þ at money. 
But how it euere be of camsoria, 
wynnynge by chaungyn of money, 
and obolastatica, 
wynnynge by passyng wit and Þeyse of money, 
vsura is euel 
and to blamynge in alle poyntes, 
as it schal be declared 
in Þe nexte chapitre. 
No man scholde vse vsura; 
and Þei marchauntes 
and oÞere be isuffred 
to vse campsoria and obolastatica, 
ut kynges and princes 
pat scholde be 
as it were half goddes schulde not vse 
but Þe first maner of money, 
pat hatte yconomyca 
and is as it were kyndelich moneye 
(and is ifonge for kyndelich thinges 
pat cornþ forþ by housbondrye, 
for housbondrie hatte yconomya in Latyn). 
And kynges and prynces scholde haue grete possessions and rentes, 
and mowe for Þe fruyt fcerof haue money ynow for defence of Þe regne 
and for oÞere nedes. 
r Chapter X I 
As Þe ferÞe of moneye pat Þe philosofer 
cleÞeþ takos 
h a Þ twey manere names, 
so by twey resons we may preue pat it is euel. 
For first, it is icleÞed gendryng and burþe of pans 
by Þe whiche name Þe philosofer, primo Poleticorum, 
argeweth pat it is aenst kynde. 
For gendryng and burÞe and multeplyeng in hemself 
is aproprede to kyndelich thinges 
and is aenst kynde of crafty thinges. 
For formes, stooles and cofres ben crafty thinges, [Þei] multeplien not hemself 
be hou euere so moche togedres; 
but for beestes ben kyndelich thinges, 
Þei | gendren and col. breden and multeplien hemself 
whanne Þei ben if ere. 
Pan he Þat wol pat Þens schulde multeplien hemself - 
as he pat wolde pat ten pans scholde be twenty 
by passyng of tyme - 
wolde pat crafty thinges 
scholde gendre and brede and multeplie hemself. 
And for pat is aenst kynde of crafty thinges 
and a Þeny 
is a crafty thing, 
it is wel iseid, primo Poleticorum, 
pat vsura, vsuri, 
is euel and aenst kynde. 
Þe seconde, 
by Þe oÞere name Þ>erof we may preue pat suche moneye is euel. 
For Þe oÞer 
n a m e Þerof is vsura and vsura is raueyne of vse 
and aenst good vse. 
For in vsura Þe vse 
is raveysched and wrongfullich itake, 
for in vsurie Þe s a m e thing is isold tweyes 
for Þe vse is The G 
o v e r n a n c e of Kings 
a n d Princes isold tweyes. 
For euydence herof 
it is to wetynge pat íÞeig a thing 
and Þe vse 
of a thing ben diuerse, as an hous and wonyng 
Þerinne ben dyuerse, 
gut in som thinges graunt of Þe vse 
may neuere be departed 
fro graunt of Þe thing. 
Panne in alle thinges in Þe whiche Þe vse of Þe thing 
may be graunt 
‡ed withoute grauntynge of Þe substaunce, 
Þerof suche thinges may Þensioun and rente ‡ be take 
Þei Þe thing 
be not aÞeyred. 
But if Þe vse may not be graunted 
withoute grauntynge of Þe substaunce, 
for suche an vse scholde no Þensioun nojser rente be fonge - 
and if it is itake, 
it is vsura pat is raueyne of vse - Jsanne for vse of hous 
is wonynge gerinne 
and is not alienacioun Jserof, 
he Þat hath hous 
may graunte Þe vse Þeroi; 
for he may graunte tenantes 
to wonye gerinne 
fcoug Þei graunte hem not 
|Þesubstaunce of Þe hous. 
f. 
For Þe hous and Þe vse Þeroi 
is his owne 
and he may lawefulliche selle 
what is his owne 
and do no man wrong. 
Panne he rauescheth not noÞer doÞ wrong 
Þei he holde to hymself Þe lordschiÞe of Þe hous 
Þei he graunte oÞere men 
Þe vse and leue to wonye gerinne. 
But it fareth not so in moneye, 
for Þe propre vse of moneye 
is sÞendyng Þerof and alienacioun. 
Panne Þe propre vse of money 
may neuere be graunted 
withoute graunt of Þe substaunce fcerof, 
for in suche an vse 
Þe substaunceÞserofmot be aliened. 
Panne for accident is deÞendant of substance 
and Þe vse comeÞ of Þe thing, 
it is wel iseid 
Þat he pat oweth Þe substaunce 
o w e p Þe vse. 
Panne he pat wol take Þensioun 
and rente of Þe vse of money 
d o p vserye and wrong and ravescheth Þe vse; 
for in grauntynge Þe vse of a Þeny, 
he graunteÞ Þe Þeny. 
Panne whanne he graunteÞ Þe Þeny, 
Þe vse Þerof 
is no lengere his owne. 
Wherfore if he takeÞ Þencioun 
oÞer rente for pat vse, 
he selleÞ what is not his owne 
and takeÞ 
Þencioun and rente of thing 
Þat is not his owne, 
for Þe vse of Þe Þeny 
is no lenger his owne 
whanne he hath igraunted 
Þe Þeny to anoÞer man. 
But it is to wetynge 
as Þe philosofer seith, primo Poletik, 
Þat as it were eche thing 
hath twey manere vse: 
Þe on is propre and Þe oÞere is not propre. 
Þe propre vse of a Þeny is chaungyng and sÞendyng Þeroi and alienacioun Þeroi. 
Þe oÞer vse 
is for to make face and schewyng 
and for to be holde riche. 
Also Þe proÞer vse of hous is wonyng gerinne, 
and Þe oÞer vse Þeroi is sillyng and chaungynge Þeroi. 
For many men maken hous | 
not onlich for to wonye gerinne 
but for to col. selle. 
And of eche vse 
wher it be proÞer oÞer not proÞer may Þencioun and rente be take 
if pat vse may be graunted 
withoute grauntynge of Þe substance. 
Wherfore it is playnliche declared 
pat it is contrarie of money and of oÞer kynges; 
for [o]f Þe proÞer vse of money 
may no rente be fonge 
withoute vserie, 
for Þe vse may not be graunted 
withoute grant of Þe substance. 
v Book II PartIII 
But of þe vse 
þat is not propre 
may rente be fonge, 
as gif a man wolde schewe moche moneye 
not for to spende 
but for to be holde riche 
as marchauntes 
ddþ ofte tyme for to be holde riche 
and for opere men 
scholde do moneye 
in here warde with pe bettere wille, 
pei hauen tofore hem moche money. 
Panne a man may graunte money 
to suche vse 
wiþoute grauntynge of pe substaunce fcerof; 
gif a man taÞeķ rente of money in pat wise, 
on caas it is som manere synne 
but nathales it is not vsery. 
A n d ofte in opere thinges is pe contrarie, 
as in pe propre vse 
it [is] not vserye. 
For wonynge in hous 
is pe propre vse of hous 
and may be graunted withoute grauntynge of pe substaunce þerof, 
þei me taÞe rente of jDat vse, 
it is not vsurie. 
But gif a man selleþ an hous 
pat is not pe propre vse of hous and fongeþ 
not his money anoun, 
gififþeifongen more money for þe vse [o]f þe hous, 
it is vserie for pe vse 
is not his after pat he hap isolde pe hous. 
For þanne it is vserie for pe vse 
is igraunted and isold 
pe whiche vse its] 
not pe creaunsoures his owne, 
and pat is aenst kynde. 
Panne kynges and princes, 
if Þey wollen be kyndelich lordes, 
scholde forbede vsurie for it 
is aenst lawe of kynde. 
J | f. m Chapter XII 
Circa finem, primo Politicorum, 
pe philosofer distingweth diuerse maners 
of getyng of money, 
and pat is ido as it were in fyue manere wise. 
Pe firste þerof hatte possessioun; 
pe seconde, mercatiua; 
pe fcridde, mercenaria and conductiua; 
pe ferfce, experimentalis; 
pe fifte, artificialis. 
Pe firste manere of getyng of money hatte possessória 
and is whanne a man hap gret poscescioun 
and getefc moneye 
for þe fruyt þerof. 
For þe philosofer seith þat an housebonde 
and a rewelere of hous 
scholde be expert 
and knowe possessioun 
and whiche ben most fruitful 
and by whiche housholde scholde be holpe at nede. 
And þat is if he knoweth 
what maner richesse 
is most píente in what londes and contrées, 
as a man hath most píente of bestes in pe contre in pe whiche suche bestes 
ben best iÞept and isaued. 
A n d in what wise pat mygte be knowe 
and h o w a man scholde haue hym aboute possessions 
and how bryddes and foules 
and foure fotede bestes scholde be Þepte and isaued 
and what lond bereJ best corn 
and what lond is best for vynes 
and how tren scholde be Þepte we desposen to passe w i p silence. 
For oķ>ere hauen 
as it semeth itreted 
of suche doynges atte fülle, 
and Paladius speÞeķ moche of suche doynges. 
Pe seconde manere of getyng of money hatte mercatiua, 
and is by marchaundise by see, 
ofcer by londe, 
oķer sendee in pis manere wynnynge. 
Pat hatte mercatiua 
is ideled in pre partees 
as þe philosofer r meneþ. 
Oon hatte nauicularia 
and is by see, 
and þe oper is carriage by | col. londe, 
and þe þridde hatte astrix. 
Pe þridde maner wynnyng of money hatte mercenaria and conductiua, 
as whanne a man worchek for mede oþser for huyre. 
Pe ferþe hatte experimentalis, 
and experience is of singuler thinges. 
Panne whanne a man knoweth singuler doynges of certeyne men 
by Ipe whiche pei wynnen money, 
þanne he haþ þe maner of wynnynge 
ķat hatte experimentalis 
for he knoweth it by experience. 
A n d Ipe philosofer reherseth twey singuler doynges 
by Ipe whiche money is iwonne. 
Pe firste was Ipe doyng of oon Gallo Mellonys, 
on of þe seuene wise men 
þat bygonne first to traueille in philosofie. 
And he was poore and blamede 
and despised of manye men 
for he traueilede in philosophie, 
and me axede of hym 
whereto his philosofie was worth for alway 
he was poore and nedy. 
Not for coueitise of moneye 
but to preue þat philosofres mo we sone by riche 
if þei wolle occupie hem 
aboute suche doynge, 
he sei and knew by astronomye 
þat in þe nexte 
er þerafter scholde be moche oyle of olyue; 
he boute al pe oyle of al men of þat lond 
þat pei scholde gadere 
in þat eere and borwede money 
and af ernesse 
for al Ipe oyle of ķ>at ere. 
Panne for he hadde moche oile 
and also for no man hadde oyle but he, 
he wan moche money 
and preuede in ķat wise ķat ļ^e philosofer may so be riche. 
Pe seconde particuler doyng Ipe philosofer 
reherseth of oon Siculus, 
a man of Cicilia 
ļ)at boute al Ipe yre of a feyre 
and solde agen 
at his owne wille and wan moche money 
for no man solde ire but he. 
A n d among oJDere | maneres of wynnyng of money 
as pe philosofer f. meneþ, 
monopolia is a gret manere of wynnyng. 
ut monopolia is whan on selleþ) 
and non mo, 
for whanne onlich on selleþ 
þe setteþ þe pris 
at his owne wil. 
Pan he þat w o l wynne money 
mot haue such synguler doynge in mynde 
by þe which money is iwonne 
þat he may if he seeth his tyme wynne money 
by suche singuler 
doyng gif suche doynge were laweful. 
Pe fifte manere hatte artificialis, craft, 
whanne a man wynnel} money by þe craft 
þat he vseth. 
For þei þe ende of Ipe craft 
of cheualrie 
be þe victorie 
and of phisik by helthe, 
ut alle craftes ben iordeyned 
as it were to moneye. 
For of crafty work phisicians, smethes, carpunters, 
and also knytes 
þat ben souderes, desiren money. 
Pan eche man fcat wol lyue in laweful 
comynte scholde ordeyne for thinges þat nedeþ to hous and haue charge of getyng of money 
as his Staat axeth. 
And among kynges and princes 
onlich twey maners semen good among maners 
þat ben itouched. 
Pe twey maners ben possessória and experimentalis. 
For þei scholde in hemself oķere by oþere be expert 
and knowe singuler condicions 
of þe regne and singuler doynges of here forfadres 
by þe whiche money was iwonne and scholde 
Þepe good vsages of þe regne by Ipe whiche Ipei fongen v Book II PartIII laweful rente. 
A n d pei scholde not byneme opere menne good wrongfulliche. 
Panne knowyng of singuler doynges and of vsages is alowed 
and pe manere of experience 
is good for kynges and princes to wynne money. 
Also pe manere wynnynge 
þat hatte possessoria is good not onliche in possessions 
pat ben vnmeuable, 
as feldes and vyngerdes 
and oþere col. suche, 
but also þei schulde haue moche possessioun mouable 
and manye bestes and foules 
to helpe þe lif 
at Ipe fulle. 
For we seen pat Frederik, 
þe emperour pat was iholde so worldlych wise, 
hadde many diuers places of storre not wiþstondyng 
pat his owne lond 
was most fructuous 
and victaylles were good cheep gerinne, nathales as it were alwey he wolde haue flesch mete of his owne hope of bestes and of foules. 
A n d pat is semelich for kynges and princes 
and for oper men of Ipe regne pat it seme not pat Ipei lyue as strangers and pilgrimes, 
for he pat beggeþ) 
alle vitayles for money lyueþ more liche a straungere pa[n] a citeseyn. 
Wherfore kynges and princes schulde haue scley men and cunnynge 
ouer telyng of feldes 
and of vynegerdes 
and also ouer bestes, roķeren and schipe, 
and oper bestes 
þat helpen to pe lif - not oonlich foure fotede bestes 
but also bryddes and foules, 
as it is ofte ivsed 
in som contre to haue manye coluers 
and oper foules 
of pe whiche mete 
is itaÞe for houshold. 
A n d as pe philosofer seith [in] Poletictis] 
me scholde be besy aboute telyng 
if þe lond of þe contre is good for suche telynge. 
A n d so in couenable contrees 
w i p litel cost moche fruyt comeþ) of bueen. 
Panne schortliche to speÞe to hem pat 
w o l lyue in laweful comynte, 
alwey cyuel lif 
is bettre þan pilgrymes lif and it is bettre a man to haue mete of his owne 
þan bygge al for money. Chapter XIII 
It is iseyd tofore 
in þis þsridde partie 
pat it scholde be spoÞe of 'fouie' : 
o r housyng, of possessions, of money, | and of seruantes, 
f. Panne for pe pre ben isped, 
it is to spekyng of pe ferþe, 
as of seruantes. 
A n d first we schal declare pat som seruage 
is kyndelich [and] pat it is kyndelich spedful 
to som men 
to be soget to oþere. 
A n d þat þe þhilosofer preueth, primo Poleticorum, 
by foure euydences itaÞe 
by foure manere liknesses. 
Pe firste is itaÞe 
by liknes pat is in souleles thinges. Pe seconde, 
by pe parties of pe same beste. 
Pe þridde, 
by diuerse kynde of beestes. 
þe ferþe, 
by dyuersete of sexus in mankynde. Sexus is pe diuersete of maal and of femel. 
Pe firste euydence is declared in pis wise. 
For neuere oon is maad of m[a]neye in pew ordre 
but oon þerof haue more maystrie þan oþer - 
as if oon armonye and acorde is maad of manye voices, 
gerinne mot be r som voice pat hath maistrie by pe whiche al pe armonye is idemed. 
Also gif oo melled body 
is imaad of manye elementis, 
þer mot be som meister element 
by þe whiche þat melled body 
hap kynde meuynge and place. 
A n d þerfore it is þat 
in alle melled bodyes 
erpe haþ þe maystrie, 
for alle suche bodies ben heuye and meuen kyndeliche downward. 
Wherfore if it is so in sowleles thinges 
pat neuere oon is imaad 
kyndeliche of menye 
but som oon be mayster þerinne, 
and companye of men is kyndelich for man 
is kyndeliche a companable beest 
as it is preued tofore atte fülle, 
neuere of manye men scholde be kyndelich o companye noļser a laweful comynte 
but it were kyndelich among men 
pat som scholde be kyndelich lordes 
and somme kynde­ liche seruantes. 
Panne somme men ben kyn|deliche [lordes] 
and som col. kyndeliche seruantes. 
Pe seconde euydence 
to preue þe same is itaÞe by thinges 
that we seen in the same beeste. 
For eche beest hath essencial partes, body and soule, 
per pe soule is as it were lord and pe body 
as it were seruant and obedient. 
For pe body may not rewele itself 
to pew worÞes and dedes 
but it is reweled 
to suche worÞes 
and dedis 
by vertue of pe soule. 
Pan for many men 
ben ilikned to oþsir 
as pe body to pe soule, 
it folweþ) 
pat þei ben kyndeliche seruant for som men lacÞen wit and vnderstondyng 
and mow not rewle hemself 
in þew worÞes and dedes. 
Pan it is spedful to hem 
to be reweled by opere men 
and to be soget to oper men. 
Pan as in a vertuous man 
and wel desposed þe soule 
hath lordschipe and maystrie 
and pe body is obedient, 
so in policy and comynte was iordeyned wise men scholde be lordes 
and vnwise men obedyent. 
For vnwyse men ben ilikned to wise men 
as pe body to pe soule 
and as pe instrument 
to pe craftes man, 
nathales som tyme vnwyse men 
ben more lordes þanne wise men. 
But pat comeþ of euel policy and rewelyng; 
for as in an euel man 
pat hath an euel soule 
pe body and lust of felyng 
hath more maystrie 
pan pe soule oþer resoun, 
so in euel polecye and rewelyng vnwis men 
ben more maistres pan wise men. 
Pe þridde euydence 
is itaÞe 
by diuerse kynde of bestes, 
as by man in comparisoun to oþeve beestes. 
For as it is iseid tofore 
man is kyndelich lord of oþere beestes, 
for we seen pat many tame bestes 
as hors and houndes 
ben in many caas isaued by wit of man, 
þei mowe not saue hemself 
by here owne wit. 
Panne it is kyndelich to hem 
to be sogett to man 
for by wit of man 
þei ben ireweled and isaued. 
Panne for vnwise men 
ben ilikned to wise men 
as bestes to | men for hem lacÞeþ 
f. witte and kunneþ not rewle hemself, 
as it is kyndeliche pat bestes be seruauntes to men so it is kyndelich pat vnwise men 
be söget to wise men. 
And yi[t] it is spedful to hem 
to be söget in pat wise pat pei mowe by here wit 
be ireweled and isaued. 
v Book II PartIII 
Pe ferJDe is itaÞe 
by diuerse sexus oķer 
by diuersete of maal 
oþer of femel. 
For we seen þat for a man 
can more reson þan a womman, 
a man is maister ouer a womman. 
Primo Poleticorum, 
it is iseid þat a womman 
hath feble counsayle. 
Panne whanne we seen þat som men hauen more defaute of vse of resoun ķan oþere men passynge defaute 
þat wymmen hauen more þan men, 
anne it folweth 
þat pei scholde be kyndeliche seruantes. 
Wherfore in som wise seruyce is kyndeliche, 
and it is kyndeliche spedful to companye of mankynde 
þat summe be seruantes 
and somme be lordes 
as it was iseid 
in þe bygynnyng of þe chapitre. Chapter XIV 
As al wiþoute lawe of kynde for þe comyn profit 
it nedeļs to haue positif lawes 
by þe whiche regnes and citees schulde be rewled, 
so it semede hem þat made lawes 
þat al withoute kyndelich seruage 
by pe whiche vnwise men schulde serue wise men it nedeþ) 
to haue laweful seruage 
and as it were positif 
by þe whiche feble men 
and ouercome scholde serue victores and myti men. Primo Poleticorum, 
Ipe philosofer seith pat it is laweful rit 
þei pat ben ouercome in bataille serue hem pat ouercomen. 
A n d pe philosofer seith pat suche rit 
is positif and skilful and pat may be declared by pre euydences. 
Pe first is itaÞe 
by hem pat maÞen lawes. 
| Pe seconde, 
by Ipe defence of Ipe contray. 
Pe col. ļ)ridde, 
by sauacioun of hem pat ben ouercome in bataille. 
Pe firste euydence and skile is declared in pis wise. 
For as Ipe philos­ ofer seith [in] Polethiciis], 
Ipe lord mot in som wise passe pe seruant 
and suche passyng 
may be double - in soule oķ>er in body, 
for eche man is kyndelich imaad 
of thes tweye parties. 
And passynge in godnesse of pe soule 
may be cleped 
as it were verrey 
and passyng and parfit. 
A n d passyng 
in goodnesse of Ipe body 
it is not so parfit passynge, 
for suche godenesse is not so good 
as goodnesse of Ipe soule 
but Ipei ben lasse good pan goodnesse of pe soule. 
Perfore it is wel iseid, primo Poleticorum, 
þat if we seyen 
þat som men ben worthi 
to be lordes for Ipei passen in goodnesse of Ipe body 
as for Ipei ben faire and stronge, 
moche more pat scholde be diffyned in Ipe soule 
so pat we seiye pat som men ben worthi 
to be lordes 
for Ipei passen in goodnesse of Ipe soule, 
for ļ^e soule is bettre þanne þe body. 
Panne wit and wisdom 
and oper goodnesse of þe soule 
maÞeþ kyndelich lordschipe and parfit and wise men 
and goode lordes of vnwis men and euel. 
But cyuyl myt and bodilich strengte pat ben goodnesse of Ipe body 
and outward good 
maÞeþ not parfit 
and kyndelich lordschipe, 
but þei maÞen laweful lordschipe and positif. 
For he pat passeth in goodnesse of pe body, 
as in strengþe 
and in cyuyle myt 
and power scholde be here lord 
pat he ouercomeļ) in bataille, 
is not kyndelich rit by The G o v e r n a n c e of K i n g s a n d Princes promilgacioun and cryenge of lawe, 
nathales in som wise suche ri^t skyl|ful 
if we taÞen hede to maÞers of lawes. 
For maÞers of f. i i lawes knowen betere good 
of pe bodye and outward good 
ļ)an good of pe soule and inward good. 
For lawe scholde eue doom 
of som certeyne doynge, 
it semede hem pat af lawes pat victores in batailles 
scholde be here lordes 
ļ^at ben ouercome in bataille 
for suche passyng 
is more iknowe ķanne pe oper. 
And so pe philosofer seith pat it is more ritful 
to deme lordschipe 
by goodnesse of pe soule panne 
by goodnesse of pe body. 
But as he seith it is not ileche ligt, ethe, to knowe pe goodnesse of pe soule and of pe body. 
Pe seconde euydence and skyle is itaÞe 
by defence of pe contre. 
For by cause pat men scholde flöte strongliche 
for defence of citees and of regnes 
for fauour of pe comynte and of pe contre, 
it was ibrout in and iordeyned 
þat victores in bataille 
scholde be here lordes pat ben ouercome. 
Wherfore vertuous wise and good men 
scholde not wikstonde laweful ordenaunce 
for pe comyn profit 
is betere pan singuler profit. 
Pe þridde euydence 
and skyle is ytaÞe 
by sauacioun of hem 
pat ben ouercome in bataille, for ofte by pis lawe men ben isaued pat ben ouercome in bataille. 
For victores wolde be pe more inclyned to manslaugt 
if þei know pat pei scholde haue no profit of hem; 
but whanne pei knowen pat pei mowe haue hem seruantes, 
pei sauen hem for profit 
þat þei hopen haue of hem. 
Perfore a seruant is icleped seruus in Latyn and pis nowne seruus comeþ of seruando (sauynge, 
in o manere menyng): 
for victores in bataille 
saueķ suche men and sleeth hem not for þei wol haue hem | to seruantes, 
boþe seruynge men and wymmen. col. semeļD r Chapter XV 
We may saye pat 
per ben foure manere of seruantes, 
for som ben kyndeliche seruantes 
and somme by lawe 
and somme for huyre and mede and somme for vertue and loue. 
Panne eche seruant is barbarus 
oþer vnmyty oper ihuyred oper vertuoes. 
He is icleped barbarus 
pat is as it were wilde 
and can not rewle hymsilf 
and is ķerfore kyndelich a seruant, 
as it is declared tofore. 
For suche faillen 
in godenesse of pe soule 
and opere passen 
in goodnesse of pe soule 
and ben lordes of suche. 
Vnmyty seruantes ben seruantes by lawe, 
as gif hem lacÞen mygt and strengte and mowe not withstonde werryours 
and ben perfore here seruantes by promilgacioun of lawe. 
Huyred men ben seruantes for huyre; 
and such oon is icleped mercennarius 
for he serueth principaliche for mede and huyre. 
But goode seruauntes and vertuous seruen for vertu and for loue. 
And peio a work man 
be worthi his huyre 
and p e i no man scholde trauaille 
on his owne cost noþer 
it is skylful pat he do, 
nathales a seruant Book II PartIII 
scholde serue principalliche for good entent. 
And if he desireth worldeliche huyre, pat scholde be pe consequent folwyng. 
A n d it nedeķ) 
to haue seruyce 
for huyre and for loue 
al withoute kyndeliche seruice and laweful seruice. 
For oure appetite is corrupte 
and we holde not alwey kynde ordre, 
comynliche lordschipe is euel; 
for vnwyse men pat lacÞen goodnesse of pe soule wolle not serue wise men and redy. 
Also for it happeth som tyme pat many men 
pat ben icome of greet blood 
dop not rigtful bataille 
al | here lif tyme 
by pe whiche pei myte gete seruantes men f. and wymmen 
to helpe in housholde at nede, ķanne for suche scholde 
not be alle seruantes, 
it nedeJD to haue summe seruantes for huyre 
and som for loue and vertuous seruantes 
for loue of good entent. 
A n d to þes seruantes 
pat seruen for vertue 
and for loue kynges and princes scholde haue hemself 
as to here owne children 
and rewle hem not as seruantes 
but as here owne children. 
A n d we may by twey euydenses 
preue pat if þer ben eny suche seruantes, 
pei scholde be worschepped more pan oper. 
Pe firste euydence 
is itaÞe 
by worthinesse of seruantes. 
þe seconde, 
for þey ben ny to pe lord. 
Pe firste wey is declared in þiS wise. 
For alwey pe more worthi scholde þei haue þe more worthi benefet, 
garnie gif a vertuous seruant seruen 
for loue of honeste 
and for loue of his lord, 
he is more worthi pan he pat serueth principaliche for huyre, 
and is also more worthi pan oon pat sevuep not for loue of honeste 
but for he is ouercome in bataille, 
and is also betere pan pe seruant 
pat hatte barbarus 
and is vnkunnynge 
and can not rewle hymself 
but lacÞed vse of resoun. 
Panne by worthinesse of seruantes it is declared pat pe lord scholde rewarde suche seruantes more pan o^ere. 
Pe seconde euydence to preue pe same is itaÞe by vnyte 
and for suche seruantes 
ben ny to pe lord. 
For it is skyle 
ļ^at parties pat ben next to pe welle hauen more water pan oper, 
for eche loue hath a maner vertue of onynge 
as Denys menyth, 
De Diuinis Nominibus, iiii, seruantes of kynges and of princes ļ^at seruen not principaliche for mede 
but for loue ben more nere 
and more ioned to ļ 
þe lordes þan col. opere seruantes. 
Wherfore it is worthi pat pei haue more worschepe and bettre reward pan opere. Chapter XVI 
For in hous of kynges 
and of princes seruantes ben iset in offis so pat som arayen for mete bordes 
and som ben maystres of hors and som ben in oþere office 
as honest manere axep, 
as it longeþ to pis doynge 
pre mot be iknowe: ordre of seruynge, 
litnesse of folwynge, 
and condicioun of seruantes. 
First, 
it is to wetyng 
þat seruantes 
scholde be sette in office of hous 
so þat good ordre of seruyng be holde. 
A n d þat is ido at þe beste if neuere manye seruantes 
ben isette in on office 
but þei ben vnder on þat is chef of þat office 
and more principalich 
toÞe hede þerto 
and haþ cheef of þat office. 
And ķe cause here is assigned, 
ii Poleticorum, 
ķat it is iseide 
ķat many seruantes seruen worse kan fe we. 
For whanne many ben iset to oon office, 
ofte ķat office is forgendred 
for ofte eche of ķe seruantes 
is neggligent in Ipe seruice and troweth ķat anoķer doķ it; 
for ouer al where multitude is ķere is confusioun 
but ķat multitude be vnder on ķat is cheef ķerof. 
For as we seen in Ipe worlde 
ķat is best iordeined for Ipe multitude of thinges 
ķat ben gerinne ben vnder oon as vnder oon G o d ķat ordeyneth alle thinges, 
so eche multitude 
[i]f it schal be ordinat 
mot be vnder oon 
to Ipe whiche it is iordeyned 
oķer of ķe whiche it is iordeyned. 
Wherfore gif manye seruantes 
ben isette in oon office for ķat office 
scholde not be furgendrid 
noķer mysÞepte noķer be inordenate, 
oon mote be isette in ķat office 
cheef aboue alle Ipe oķere 
þat mot rewle and ordeyne alle þe oķere. A n d þis lore ļ is most f. 
nedful in rewelyng of hous of kynges: 
for ķerinne ben grete office, 
it nedeþ 
[þ]at manye seruantes 
ben in oon office 
for oon may not do al ķat longeķ to ķat office. 
Panne in settynge of seruantes in office ordre of seruynge mot be knowe. 
Pe seconde, litnesse of folwynge 
and of doynge mot be knowe, 
and þat is best iknowe 
if oon is sette in manye diuerse office. 
And þe resoun herof 
may be taÞe of kynges 
ķat ben iseid, 
iiii Polethicorum. 
For we schal imagine in ķis wise ķat as a grete citee 
hath itself to a litil citee, 
so a greet hous hath itself to a litel hous. 
A n d as it is iseid, 
circa finem, iiii Poleticorum, 
in a greet citee oon man scholde not haue manye diuerse office, 
for in a greet citee office 
ben grete and hauen wiķ 
so greet charge 
ķat oon persone 
may not litliche 
do manye office and diuerse. 
But in a litel citee oþer 
in a litel toun 
for þer wonyen but fewe men 
and þer þe office 
hauen no greet chaarge, 
oon may haue diuerse offices. 
Panne what is iseid of a litel citee 
and a greet schal be vnderstonde of a litel hous and a greet. 
But in a litel hous 
ķere ben fewe seruantes 
and office with litel charge 
it is not euel sittynge 
þey oon seruant haue many offices, 
for þ houshold myte be so litel ķat on seruant myte esiliche be kook and seruant 
at þe borde and porter of þe eate. 
But in hous of kynges and princes 
ķer ben manye seruantes 
and þere offices hauen greet charge, 
þe office moot nedes be departed and distingwed 
and not oon isette in manye offices lest esy spendynge of ķe office be ilette. 
Pe ķridde, 
in settynge of seruantes ļ in office ķe condicioun of hem col. 
mot be knowe, 
for comynliche seruantes faillen in tweyne. 
For som doun euel ķe work ķat Þey ben isette to, 
for as somme despisen and doun fraude 
in ķe kynges lawe. 
And somme doķ euel ķe work ķat ķei r I Part III ben isette to, 
but pat is not of euel wil for pei wolde good 
but pat is by dulnesse of wit 
for þei ben dul and vnwise. 
Perfore þou þei decerne not and doun no fraude, 
ut þei ben deceyued 
and bygeled by fraude. 
Panne where ben manye seruantes 
pei mot be trewe and wise: 
trewe in ritful wille 
fcat pei doun no fraude, 
and wise and sley of vnderstondyng 
pat is iknowe by lengķe of tyme. 
For we may not ise pe herte of a man; 
but gif he bere hym wel 
and treweliche long tyme 
and in diuerse tymes 
and in diuerse offices 
pat he hath ben inne, 
þanne he is trewe. 
Wisdom and prudencia 
is iknowe by thinges 
pat we seide in pe firste book - 
as if he hap good mynde 
and is wel avised 
and waar al aboute and oper p a t we seide ļere, 
he is iholde wise and prudens, 
and j^at as he hath more oļ^er lasse of suche condiciouns. Chapter XVII 
For þe wisdom of a kyng 
is most iknowe 
if he reweleth wel his maynye and fynden hem ordinatliche what hem nedeJD, 
and for good prouisioun of cloþyng semeļ) 
most helpliche to pe staat of worschepe, 
for kynges and princes scholde be taut how pei scholde do worschepfulliche 
and wisliche in þat doyng, 
it is to wetynge h o w clothinge scholde be ieue. 
And to euydence JDerof 
as it longeþ 
to pis doynge it is to I wetynge pat fife most be knowe: 
greet doynge of pe kyng, 
e[uen]es f. of seruantes, 
condicioun of persones, 
vsage of contrajye, 
and couenable tyme. 
For a kyng scholde be magnificus 
and do grete worÞes and dedes 
as it is ipreued tofore 
at pe fulle in pe firste book, 
he scholde bere hym semeliche 
to his seruantes 
in good araye 
and in pewe clothinge. 
For þei such thinges schulde not be do 
for brag and boost, 
ut for to Þepe kynges and princes in here astaat of greet doyng 
and also for pe puple schulde not sette litel by hem, 
it is semelich pat pei maÞe 
and do greet worÞes and dedes 
as pe philosofer preueķ, 
vi Poleticorum. 
Pe seconde, 
in clothinge euenesse 
and liknesse of seruantes moot be knowe. 
For it scholde be knowe 
pat suche seruantes ben kynges men oper princes 
oþer som oper lordes, 
sauynge pe condicioun of persones 
pat scholde most taÞe hede pat pei ben closed of sewte, 
[for] in hous of kynges and of princes 
ben many grees of persones; 
ķanne alle pat ben gerinne of oo degree, 
oper not fer atwynne, 
scholde be closed in oo sute, 
for it scholde be knowe 
by pe sewte of clofcyng 
pat pe[i] ben seruantes of on prince. 
Pe ķridde, 
in prouisioun of cloJDynge 
condiciouns of persones mot be knowe, 
for pey scholde not alle be closed iliche. 
For i n suche grete hous 
ben not onliche lewede men 
but also clerÞes 
and among eyper ben men 
of diuerse grees and Staates, 
pei scholde perfore be v dyuersliche arayed. 
And so we seen in ordre of ķe world 
ķat al ķe world is as it were oon hous of ķe heiest prince ķat is God, 
as ķe philosofer seith playnlich, 
xii Methephisice, 
and in ķis hous not | 
alle kynges ben col. arayed iliche noķer ben iliche fayre; 
but by ķe consideracioun of ķe condicioun of thinges 
summe ben more faire 
and some lasse faire 
as ordre axeth and ritwisnesse of ķe worlde, 
and ķerinne ķe wonder wisdom 
of ķe maÞere is declared. 
Wherfore in hous of kynges and princes of ķe whiche eche 
by diuerse seruantes and office 
may be cleped 
as it were a certeyn world, 
not alle seruantes ben iliche faire icloķed; 
but knowyng ķe condicioun of persones 
eche scholde be arayed 
after his owne degree 
and staat for to knowe 
Þerby ķer prouysioun 
and wisdom of ķe prince. 
Pe ferķe in ķis doynge, 
ķe vsage of ķe contre mot be knowe, 
for al ķat is not ivsed semeķ 
as it were foule and not-ordenat. 
For we louen best thingis 
ķat we vsen to see of childhood, 
it is iseid, 
vii Poleticorum, 
about ķe ende, 
ķat alway we louen ķe firste more ķan oķer. 
And comonliche we seen ķat men louen so 
moche vsages 
of here owne contrées and conuersacion of here owne lond so ķat ķei ben worse and fouler ķan oķere, 
ut ķei holden hem fairere 
and betere ķan oķere. 
Panne in clokynge 
and in al oķere aray and doynge it is to takynge heede of ķe vsage of ķe contray 
but ķe vsage be corrupt and not worth. 
And [ķe fifķe] in ķe same, 
me mot taÞe hede of couenable tyme. 
For be cause ķat þes neþer bodies 
ben irewled by ķe ouer bodies of heuene, 
as tymes chaungyng 
in þe condicions of heuene, 
mete and drynÞe and cloþing 
and oþer suche þat seruen and helpen to Þepe 
and saue ķe lif schulde be ichaunged. Chapter XVIII 
It semeth ķat curtesye hath hymself 
to gentelnesse and noblenesse of maners 
as þe vertue iusticia legalis 
hath itself to fulfillynge of þe law. 
For, 
as it schal be knowe in þe processe, 
as þat vertue iusticia legalis 
I is in som manere wise alle vertue, 
for lawe hoteþ to fulfille al vertue, 
so curtesie is in som wise al vertue 
for it is iseide ķat 
as it were eche vertue 
folwek gentilesse and noblenesse of maneres. 
And we may distyngwe double noblenesse: 
oon by trowyng and noblenesse of good blood (noblenesse to vnderstonde of greet worthinesse and gentellesse and noblenesse of blood); 
and anoķer by soķenesse 
and noblenesse of maners. 
And it semeth ķat gentelnesse 
and noblenesse 
is igrounded 
in som passynge goodnesse, 
for man scholde neuere be cleped more gentel 
and noble ķan oķere 
but he passede him in som what. 
Panne as ķer is twey manere greet good - 
for som is iholde greet good [a]s outward good, 
and som is verrey greet good 
as vertues and good of ķe soule - 
so ķer is double gentelnesse and noblenesse: 
oon f. ii r I PartIII ķat is igrounded in passynge greet good by oppynyoun and trowynge, 
and ķe oķer is igrounded 
in verrey greet good. 
For comynliche ķe comyn men 
and puple perseyuen 
not but sencible and outward good 
as greet blood, richesse, 
and cyuel myt and power. 
Panne he ķat is icome of gree[t] blood 
as of riche men and mygty 
and ķat of olde tyme 
so ķat men hauen no mynde 
whanne here forefadres were pore men, 
he is icleped a noble man of blood 
and is ķerfore iholde a noble man of blood 
and iholde a noble man among ķe puple. 
But verrey noblenesse is in passynge 
in goodnesse of maners. 
But for fame and loos 
is neuere al ilost 
and what is comynliche iseid 
may not be al fais 
as ķe philosofer meneķ, 
vii Ethicorum, 
suche ļ comyne opynyoun lynek col. 
vppoun som goodnesse. 
For we seen ķat comynliche gentil men 
and noble men of blood 
ben more noble of maners þan oþere. 
For as it is iseid, 
primo Poleticorum, 
as of man comeþ [a] man 
and of bestes comeþ a beest, 
so comynliche of good men comeķ good men 
and of wise men comen wise men. Panne for noble men [ben] comynliche with manye men 
and ben as it were expert 
and comynliche more wise 
þan oþere men, 
for comynliche manye men 
byholden in hym, 
þei ben þe more schamefast to don eny foule doynge. 
A n d for noble men 
ben in staat of blood 
in ķe whiche Staat 
it is probable and semelich 
þat þei be more wise 
þan oþere men, 
and also by cause of þe staat 
þei scholde be more noble 
þan oþere men, 
if it is probable and semelich þat of good men 
and rightewise comeþ good men and of wyse men comen wise men 
and þei þat ben icomen of gentel men and noble ben icleped gentel men and noble by opynyoun for þe opinyoun lenyek on goodnesse and, 
as it is ischewed, 
it is semelich and probable 
þat suche men ben good men and wise. 
But in stede som tyme of þis goodnesse is falshede, 
for as it is iseide [in] Poletidis], 
kynde w o l do þis 
and þat and is ofte ilette 
and may not but faille. 
For som gentil men of blood gooþ 
out of kynde and out of verrey gentilesse and ben worse of maners þan oþere men. 
Panne if gentelnesse of blood 
is gentelnesse be opynyoun and trowynge 
and gentelnesse of maneres 
is verrey gentelnesse, 
for þei þat ben iholde good scholde be good in dede, 
gentel men of bloode scholde be gentel men of maners. 
A n d it semeth 
þat þis | word curtesie comeþ of þis f. word court, 
for propreliche for to speÞe court 
is nout elles but hous of noble men and grete; 
and for noble men and grete scholde be noble men of maners, 
þerfore þei þat hauen noble maners 
ben icleped curteys men. 
Wherfore curtesye may be cleped gentelnesse and noblenesse of maners. 
Panne curtesie is in som wise eche vertue 
in comparisoun to noblenesse of maners 
as iusticia legalis 
is eche vertue 
in comparisoun to folwynge of þe lawe. 
For lawe hoteþ 
to do eche vertue 
as þe lawe hoteþ 
to do no spouse brech, 
þat is þe werk of temporatnesse 
and of v chastite; 
and hoteþ to flee not out of pe bataille, 
pat is a work of fortitudo; 
and so of oþere. 
But gentelnesse and noblenesse of maners techep eche vertue. 
Perfore in som wisecurtesie is eche vertue. 
For pey ben icleped curteyse pat euen gladliche skilful iftes, 
þat is work of liberalte. 
Also þei ben icleped courteise 
pat beren hem semeliche in greet spence and cost, 
pat is pe work of magnificencia. 
Also pei ben icleped curteise 
pat eten and drynÞen in faire manere 
pat is Ipe work of temporancia. 
Also men ben icleped curteys 
to here neighbores 
if þei doun hem no wrong 
in wyves noķer in doutres, 
pat is pe work of chastite. 
Also a man is icleped courteys in conuersacioun 
if he is good to speÞe wiþ 
and of glad chere to opere men, 
þat is þe work of goodnesse in spekynge. 
Panne for to speÞe to oon, 
in som manere wise curteise 
is eche vertue. 
Panne while doynge may come of special vertue, 
of iusticia legalis, 
and of courtesye 
as if a man eueþ 
of his good gladliche to his neighbores, 
if he dop so 
for he hap | likynge in suche doynge, 
þanne col. he is icleped liberalis; 
but if he dop so for to fulfille þe lawe 
as for þe lawe hotel) so, 
ķanne he is icleped iustus legalis; 
but if he doþ aut for it is pe manere of court and of noble men, 
þanne he is curialis, cuiteis. 
Also if pey speÞen gladliche and goodliche with opere, 
gif þei don it for suche doynge 
it is plesyng to hym, 
þanne he is icleped affabilis, 
goodlich in spekyng; 
but if þei doun so for to fulfille þe lawe, 
ķanne he is icleped iusticia legalis; 
and if þei doun so for to folwe þe maners 
of court and of gentil men, 
þanne he is icleped curialis, curteys. 
A n d manye men don worÞes of vertues and euen of here good to opere men 
and doun not so for likynge pat pei hauen in spendynge and in iftes 
as pe liberal man hath, 
noþer for to fufille pe lawe pat hoteþ 
so as iustus legalis dop, 
but for to folwe pe man[er]es of court and of gentile men 
pat scholde eue iftes. 
Perfore suche oon scholde be icleped curialis. 
But it is to wetyng 
þat þei curialitas, curtesie, 
be in som wise eche vertue, 
ut in a manere passyng wise pei pat ben large of iftes and curteise of speche ben icleped curiales; 
for in courtes and in hous of gentel men 
and noble where many men 
ben and pere is comynlich moche outward good, 
nameliche pere moot be greet cost and gentil spekyng. 
For it is declared what is curtesie, 
it may sone be iknowe 
pat seruantes of kynges and princes 
scholde be curteyse. 
For if kynges and princes, 
for þei ben in greet Staat of noblenesse, 
schulde haue good maneres 
and noble and curteyse, 
þanne þe seruantes 
þat | f. scholde folwe here lordes 
in good maners 
þei scholde also be good and courteys. 
r Book II Part III Chapter XIX 
It is declared what manere men scholde be seruantes of kynges and of princes 
for þei scholde haue good maners noble and courteys. 
For as citeseyns schulde be laweful and rigtful 
for to holde and Þepe good rewle, 
so for to holde and saue honour 
and worschep of court seruantes of lordes 
scholde be good and curteise. 
Wherfore if we knowen 
whiche þe seruantes scholde bee, 
it is to declarynge 
h o w kynges and princes and alie lordes 
scholde doo by here seruantes. 
A n d it semeþ 
þat good manere doynge 
by hem stant in fyve: first, 
þat þei ben wel isette in office; 
þe seconde, 
þat þei ben maad besy in here office; 
þe þridde, ķat me knowe how me scholde comyne wik hem; 
ķe ferķe, 
how ķei scholde knowe counsaylle and preueyte; 
þe fifte, 
it nedeþ to knowe 
how þei scholde be rewarded. 
Pe firste herof 
is som del declared tofore. 
For gif a seruant 
þat scholde be sette in office scholde be trewe 
þat he do no fraude and wise and redy 
þat no fraude be don to hym, 
þe betere his trouthe 
and his wisdome 
ben iknowe 
in þe grettere office 
þe scholde be sette. 
N o man may assay þe goodnesse and trouþe of anoþer 
atte fülle but by long tyme, 
as þe philosofer meneþ, 
vii[i] Ethicorum, 
for þere it is iseid 
in a prouerbe þat men knowen not eche oþer 
ar þei spende manye buschels of salt. 
Also þe wisdom and redynesse of a man 
is not iknowe atte fulle 
but we see hym do wisliche 
and rediliche longe tyme. 
Panne in þis wise seruantes 
scholde be isette in office: 
first þei scholde be sette in smale offices 
for to ļ knowe here trouþe 
and here redinesse; 
and col. if þei beren hem wel þerinne, 
þanne þei mowe be sette in grettere office. 
But it is besiliche to takyng hede þat as þe philosofer seith, 
i i Retoricorum, 
comynlich þei 
þat ben newedliche imaad riche and comen sone 
vp of a lowe astaat to an heigh hauen worse maners þan oþere. 
Perfore if officers of foule blood 
beren hem wel in smale office 
and semen good and trewe and don rediliche it 
þei scholde not anoon be isette 
in to greet office and high but þei scholde come vpward by diuerse grees 
and ben assayed long tyme 
or he be sette in hi office. 
It is iknowe how seruantes scholde be isette in office; 
it is to wetynge h o w þei scholde be maad besy in here offis. 
For it is not semelich 
ķat grete lordes 
noþer kynges and princes haue in here owne persones charge and besynesse of seruantes, 
for as it is iseid, primo Poleticorum, 
þat is not greet doynge. 
Perfore it is concluded 
þat eche lord scholde voide suche doynge and commaunde 
þat a procuter tak 
þat werschep, 
and þei lyuen cyuel lif oþer traueillen in philosofie. 
Panne a kyng oþer a prince 
þat scholde be magnanimus 
scholde do fewe dedes and grete, 
for þei scholde be besy aboute thinges 
þat longen streit to þe comyn profit and to rewelyng of þe regne - 
and what thinges thilÞe ben it schal be iseide 
in þe þridde book. 
For it is [not] semelich for kynges and princes 
and oķere lordes 
to be besy aboute seruantes 
noķer to entermete of al smale thinges. 
For ķis is iseie, 
it is to declaryng 
how me scholde do by hem; 
and þat in som wise the philosopher techeth, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
þere he seith þat to þe meÞe magnanimus scholde bere hym moderatliche, 
and | to hem f. ķat ben in dignité magnanimus scholde maÞe hemself greet. 
Panne a kyng oķer a prince scholde be magnanimus 
to his owne seruantes 
þat ben lowere þan he and to þe meÞe þei scholde schewe hemself moderatliche, 
for as þe philosofer seith playnliche 
þat it is not vertuous dede 
but charious to schewe hymself to hem to excellent. 
A n d how þe mene and moderat schal be taÞe 
in suche doyng 
it may be knowe by þe philosofer, 
v Poleticorum, 
þere it is iseid 
þat a prince scholde not seme cruele but reuerent. 
Panne a prince scholde not be to homlich 
and bere hym so 
þat his seruantes sette litel by hym so þat he seme 
not a reuerent persone, 
noķer ķei scholde seme so excellent ķat he seme cruel and heuy. 
For as it is iseid [in] Ethic[is], 
in alle doynges þe mene is ipreysed and defaute 
and to moche is blamed. 
But it is to wetyng ķat som homlichnesse 
is to preysyng 
in a citeseyn oþer in a knyt 
þat is not to presynge in a kyng, 
for kynges and princes scholde 
in alle wise be lasse homelich 
þan oþere and kyÞe, 
þat is teche, 
þat þei ben more reuerent persones 
and more worthi 
þan oþere - not for brag and bost, 
but for kynges dignité scholde not be despised. 
For it is declared how seruantes scholde be sette in office 
and how ķei scholde be besy 
and how me scholde do by hem, 
it is to wetynge how ķei scholde knowe consayle 
and how ķei scholde be rewarded. 
For it is iseid tofore 
þat þer ben diuerse maners of seruauntes, 
for som ben kyndelych seruantes 
and summe by lawe 
and som seruen principalliche for huyre 
and som principaliche for loue of þe prince ķan for mede. 
Panne kyndeliche seruantes scholde | not knowe preuey col. counsaille, 
for as it is iseid tofore, 
no man is kyndelich a seruant 
but he be vnwise 
and haue lacÞe of vse of resoun. 
Aboute þe ende primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer speÞeth 
of suche seruantes 
and seith ķat a womman hath feble counsaile 
and a child 
vnparfit consaille 
and a seruant hath no counsaile. 
Also seruantes by lawe scholde not comynliehe knowe preuey counsaile, 
for comynliche suche seruen more 
for drede ķan for loue; 
noķer seruantes for huyre scholde knowe preuey counsaille, 
for suche seruantes louen not principaliche ķe prince 
but huyre and mede. 
But seruantes þat seruen for loue, 
gif it is iknowe 
by assaye of long tyme 
þat þei ben wel willed, trewe, wise and redy, 
þei mowe knowe preuey counsaille more oþer lasse as ķe prince knowek 
þat þei ben trewe, 
wys and redy. 
And how seruantes scholde be rewarded for here 
traueille it was iseide 
þat it scholde be last itreted 
and may sone be iknowe. 
For kynges and princes may eue grete iftes and manye and scholde not Book II Part III 
wiþholde mede and huyre of seruantes, 
but þei scholde rewarde hem and eue hem more iftes oþer lasse 
as it is iknowe 
þat þei hauen deserued and ben worthi more oþer lasse. Chapter XX 
For it is iseide what seruauntes kynges and princes scholde haue 
and how kyngis and princis scholde haue hemself to here seruantes, 
it is to wetyng how kynges and princes 
and alle þat eten wiþ hym and seruantis schulde haue hemjself 
at mete bordes, 
in spendyng and in talkynge. 
A n d we may declare 
by twey weyes ķat at mete bordes 
of kynges and of princes 
and of alle noble men 
and of alle cyteseyns it is ! 
lacuna [not fitting for there 
to be an abundance of speech. The first way is taÞen 
from the fact that this is repugnant to natural order; 
the second from the fact that it is contrary to good morals. 
The first way becomes clear in the following manner. 
For, 
as it is said in the first book of the Politics, 
each thing is then perfected according to nature 
when one organ is ordained to one work. 
In fact, 
as there ought not to be confusion in works of nature, 
because her works are ordained by G o d Himself 
and by intelligent agents, 
if nature should create the same organ for two works, so that there be no confusion in the works 
and so that one does not impede the other, 
it is against natural order 
that we should undertaÞe 
to do one work 
by means of its organ 
if at the same time we do not cease from the other work. 
Wherefore, 
since according to the Philosopher in D e A 
n i m a , II, 
the tongue serves for two works of nature, 
namely tasting and speaking, 
it is against natural order 
when we exercise such an organ 
for the work 
that consists of tasting, 
as is done at the table at the time of eating, 
if at the same time we do not desist 
from the other work, 
which consists of speaking. 
So this is repugnant to natural order. 
In the second place, 
it is repugnant to good morals. 
For if those reclining at the table tend towards much speech, 
since wine seems to increase speech 
and men abounding in wine, 
as if heated and bold, 
gladly burst into words, 
they will seem to be drunk rather than sober. 
So kings and princes, 
whom it befits 
to be most temperate 
and by all means to observe natural order at their tables, 
ought to ordain 
that those reclining not burst into much speech. 
This is also proper for nobles in general 
and for all citizens, 
since it is fitting 
that they too should have a share of virtues and good morals. 
But if it befits those reclining, 
lest natural order be destroyed 
and they appear intemperate, 
to avoid an increase of speech, 
it so befits even the very servants, 
lest the order 
and the appropriate arrangement of serving 
be neglected and impeded. 
In fact, 
if at the tables of kings and princes some useful things were read aloud continually, 
so that at the same time as the throats 
of those reclining taÞe food their ears might receive learning, 
this w o u l d be altogether fitting and proper. 
Therefore kings and princes ought to ordain that praiseworthy customs of the kingdom, 
if such have been collected in a book or otherwise in writing, 
be read at the table; 
or also praiseworthy deeds of their predecessors, 
and especially of those who have comported themselves 
in a sacred manner 
and religiously 
with respect to divine things, 
and who have ruled the kingdom justly and in due fashion; or that there be read at the table the book D e R e g i m i n e P r i n c i p u m , 
both so that princes themselves might be instructed 
in how they should rule, 
and that others might be taught how to be obedient to princes. 
These things then or other useful things, 
reported in the common idiom 
so that all could be instructed through them, 
would be the things to be read 
at the tables of kings and princes. 
So having dealt with these matters concerning the rule of the household, 
although certain other particulars could be treated, 
nevertheless, 
since not all particulars fall under the heading of what should be reported, 
we propose to pass them by in silence, 
putting an end to this second 
n which we have dealt with the art of domestic rule 
in accordance with the small measure of our knowledge, 
supported by the help of Him 
from whom all goodness and sufficiency have come forth.] [Explicit liber secundus.] II Part I lacuna [

For eche citee 
is a certeyne comynte, 
sethe þat eche comynte 
is for f. som profite,

for som good and profit. 
A n d , primo Poleticorum, 
þe philosofer preueþ 
by twey weyes ķat a citee is iordeyned for som good and profit. 
Pe firste wey is itaÞe 
by men ķat maÞen þe citee; 
þe seconde, 
by þe citee þat is imaad. 
Pe firste wey is declared in þis wise. 
For, primo Ethicorum, 
ķe philos­ ofer seith 
ķat it semeķ ķat alle dede 
and al eleccioun desiren som certeyn good. 
And, primo Poleticorum, 
it is iwrete ķat 
by cause of som 
what ķat semeķ good, 
men doun alle here worÞes. 
Panne gif alle men ordeynen here worÞes 
[by cause of som what ķat semeķ good], 
and a citee is work of mankynde, 
by men ķat maÞen ķe citee, 
ķe cite mot be maad 
by cause of som what ķat semeķ good. 
A n d ķis schal not be vnderstonde in ķis wise so ķat a citee is maad 
by cause of good oķer of som what ķat semeķ good 
and is not imaad 
by cause of som what ķat is good in dede. 
For whanne we ordeynen owre worÞes 
to som what ķat is good, 
som tyme we ben inclyned 
to ķat good 
by kynde 
and som tyme as it were 
by corrupcioun of kynde. 
A n d þat good 
þat alle men desiren by kynde semeþ good so þat it is good in dede, 
and suche r Book III Part I 
good is makynge of a cite. 
For, primo Poleticorum, 
it is iseid ķat alle men ben inclyned 
by kynde to suche a comyntee 
as is þe comynte of a cite, 
þanne by comparisoun to men 
þat maÞen þe citée, 
for þei ben kyndelich inclyned to þe makyng herof, 
a cyte is not onlich imade 
by cause of som what þat semeþ good 
but | also by cause of som what þat col. is good in dede. 
Pe seconde wey to preue þe same is itaÞe 
by þe citee imaad 
and by comparisoun to oþere comyntees. 
For þei eche kynde comynte be ordeyned to som what þat is good, 
ut þe moste principal comynte is most iordeyned 
to þat good. 
And suche a comynte is comynte of a citee 
þat is more principal comynte þan comynte of hous 
oþer of strete. 
Wherfore if comynte of hous is iordeyned 
to som good 
and also to manye manere good, 
as it is preued 
in þe seconde book 
atte fulle, 
comynte of strete 
þat is more principal 
þan comynte of hous 
is moche more iordeyned to good. 
And ut þe comynte þat is more principal 
ķan comynte of hous 
oķer of strete is most yordeyned to good. 
And ķis is to menynge, primo Poleticorum, 
if we menen ķat al comynte is imaad 
by cause of som good 
and namelich ķe most principal of alle 
and most principalliche conteynynge aile oķere is imaad by cause of som good, 
and ķis comynte is comynte politik 
ķat is comynliche icleped ciuitas, 
a cite. 
But it is to wetynge 
ķat comynte of citee is more principal ķan comynte of hous 
oķer of strete 
and so comynte of cite 
is most principal of ķre commyntees of hous, strete and citee. 
A n d anoķer comynte is more principal ķan comynte of citee 
and ķat is comynte of regne of ķe whiche it schal be seid in his owne place. 
And we schal declare ķat comynte of regne 
is profitable to ķe lif of mankynde 
and more princi­ pal ķan comynte of citee. 
A n d it semeþ in sum wise þat comynte of regne passeķ comynte of cite 
as comynte of citee passeth [comynte of hous oþer of strete]. 
| For as a cite conteyneþ hous and strete 
and is f. 
more principal þan hous and strete 
and more suffisaunt to ķe lif þan comynte of hous and strete, 
so comynte of regne conteyneth comynte of citee 
and is more parfit 
and more suffisaunt to þe lif 
þan þat comynte. V Chapter II 
It is not inow to telle 
þat a citee 
is maad 
by cause of som good and profit, 
as it is ipreued 
in þe chapitre tofore, 
but it is declared what good 
and how manye manere good men 
hauen by makynge of cite. 
A n d as it longeþ 
to þis doynge 
þer is þre manere of suche good, 
for a cite is iordeyned 
for to lyue, 
for to wel lyue, 
and for vertuousliche lyue. 
For ķe philosofer seith þat lif of þe hole is beynge to hem þat lyuen. 
Panne as it is [other to be] 
other to bee suffisauntliche and oþer to be vertuosliche, 
so it is oþer to lyue 
[and other to lyue] 
suffisantliche and oþer to lyue vertuosliche. 
For as it is iseid in libro De Causis, 
beynge is most large, 
for þe firste of alle thinges 
þat ben imaad 
in al thinges hauen beyng in som wyse. 
But not alle thinges hauen suffisant beynge 
but onliche ķulÞe thinges hauen suffisant beynge 
ķat ben complete and parfit in here owne kynde. 
For if a kyng lacÞeķ 
eny perfeccioun ķat longeķ 
to þe kynde þerof, 
þei þat kyng mygt haue som beynge 
as vnparfit beyng 
but it is not iseide 
ķat it hath suffisaunt beynge, 
ķanne beyng is more large ķan suffisaunt beynge. 
Also suffisant beynge 
is more large ķan vertuous beynge, 
for onliche resonable thing 
with wit and vnderstondyng 
may haue vertue ķat is habitus electiuus and morale, 
of ķe whiche we thinÞen to speÞe heere (habitus electiuus 
is a sad vertue with fre choys). 
And an vnļresonable thing 
oķer soûles thing col. may haue suffisant beynge 
if he hath perfeccioun 
þat longeķ 
to e kynde þerof 
and may not haue vertuous beynge 
for it 
may not haue vertues morale. 
Panne as we distyngwe symple beynge 
and suffisant beyng and vertuos beynge, 
so we may distyngwe lyuyng 
and suffisaunt leuyng 
and vertuos leuyng. 
In what staat euere a man be, 
he hath leuynge, 
but hath no suffisaunt leuynge 
but he haue thinges 
þat suffiseth to helpe in bodilich nede. 
Panne it is oþer to lyue and oþer to lyue sufficiantliche. 
Also it is oþer to lyue sufficiantlyche 
and oþer to lyue vertuousliche, 
for manye men hauen sufficiant lifyng and reccheķ not to lyue vertuosliche for corupte appetite. 
Panne makyng of cite is cause of manye maner good 
and of manye manere greet good, 
for Þerby men hauen þe forseide þre manere good. 
For men hauen leuynge by comunycacioun politic, 
for Þerwikoute 
may not a man lyue, 
and we speÞe of a man leuyng 
as a man and streccheth politik lifynge to leuynge 
by lawes and good vsages and ordenaunce, 
he þat wol not leue 
so wol not leue as a man, 
but as it is ipreued tofore and schal be here after, 
suche oon is worse ķanne a man oþer better þanne a man for man is kyndelich a politik best and cyuyl 
as it schal be preued. 
Panne leuyng, 
for to speÞe of leuynge as a man, 
men hauen leuyng 
by comunicacioun politik 
and by makynge of citee. Pe seconde, 
by suche makynge men hauen not onliche leuynge 
but also suffisaunt leuynge. 
For in oon hous oþer in oon strete 
is not ifounde al þat suffiseth to þe lif, 
þerfore is a citee imaad 
in þe whiche | f. ben manye stretes. 
A n d in oon strete 
is smeþes craft, 
in anoķer webbe crafte 
and in anoþer oþer craft 
as vs nedeþ diuerse thinges 
to helpe vs to leuynge. 
For neuere a citee is parfit 
but þei þat dwellen þerinne mowe fynde ķerinne thinges 
ķat suffisen to ķe lif. 
Panne of a citee we hauen not oonliche leuynge 
as a man 
but also suffisant leuynge. 
For if ķe citee is parfit, 
ķerinne is al ķat suffiseth to ķe lif. 
Panne it is wel iseid, primo Poleticorum, 
ķat ķe comynte 
ķat is a cytee imaad of many stretes 
r Book III 
Parti is a parfit comynte, 
for now as it folweth suche a comyntee is imaad for to haue ķerinne al ķat suffiseth to þe lif. 
Pe þridde, 
by makynge of cite we hauen vertuos leuynge. 
For his intencio þat eueķ lawe and maÞeþ 
a citee scholde not oonliche be for cyteseyns scholde haue 
in þe cite what suffiseth to þe lif, 
but also for to leue 
w e l by lawe and vertuousliche. 
Perfore, primo Poleticorum, 
it is iseid 
þat a citee is maad 
by cause of leuynges and dureķ 
by cause of wel leuynge: 
on caas ķe first ķat meued men to maÞe 
a citee was leuynge and haue sufficiant leuynges. 
Sayeng ķat in solitarie leuyng ķei myt not be sufficiant to hemself in lif, 
ķei made a cite for on scholde helpen anoķer to sufficiant leuynge. 
A n d whanne ķe citee was imaad, 
men took better heede and sie ķat 
it is not inow to haue suffisant leuynge 
but ķer be also vertuos leuynge. 
For wikoute lawe and rightwysnese 
ķe cite mygte not stonde, 
ķei ordeyned comunycacioun politik 
ķat was imaad for leuynge 
and for to haue suffisaunt leuynge 
to lyue good lif 
and to lyue by lawe and vertuousliche. 
Panne if we hauen so moche and so many maner good | 
by makynge col. of cite, 
it is wel iseide, primo Poleticorum, 
þat þe firste ķat made cite 
was cause of most good. Chapter III 
O n caas som man wolde meue a doute 
if a cite is som what by kynde 
and if a man is kyndelich politic, 
a cyuel best. 
For king ķat is by kynde 
abideķ alwey 
and in eche place, 
as fuir hetiķ alway 
and in ech place 
if ķer is out to fonge his heete. 
Wherfor if a cite were som what by kynde and gif a man were kyndeliche a cyuel beste, 
eche man were cyuel. 
But we seen ķat many men 
forsaÞen politik companye and chesen solitarie lif and lyuen alone in desert. 
But it semeķ ķat ķese doutes 
and oķere suche comen of vnconnynge, 
for som knowen not what wise 
it is kyndeliche to man 
to be a cyuel beste. 
For ķat is not kyndelich to man 
in ķe same wise 
as it is kyndelich to ķe fyre 
for to hete 
and to a stoun 
for to meue adounward, 
for such doyng ben so kyndelyche to fuyre and stoon ķat ķei mowe not vse ķe contrarye 
but ķei ben kyndeliche 
to hem alwey 
and in eche place. 
For neuere a stoon myte 
so ofte be krowe vpward 
ķat he scholde vse by hymself to meue vpward, 
þanne alwey ķe stoon doþ 
what is in hym to meue dounward 
and þe fuyre heteþ alwey. 
But man is not in ķat wise kyndeliche a cyuel beest, 
but he is icleped kyndelych a cyuel beest 
for he hath a certeyn appetite 
and kyndelich able to lyue ciuel lyf. 
And thinges þat ben in þis wise kyndeliche mowe be lette 
by som happe oþer by som cause, 
as þei it be kyndeliche to man 
to be rit honded git 
ma[n]y men ben boķe rit honded and lift honded. 
So Þey it be kyndelich toman to lyue cyuel lyf 
and in comynte, 
ut many men forsaÞen cyuel lif and leuen in desert. 
And, primo Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer toucheķ ķre ļ wheifore 
som men forsaÞen cyuel f. ii lif and companye. 
Pe firste is fortune; 
ķe seconde, passynge schrewednesse; 
ķe ķridde, goodnesse. 
And som men leuen not cyuel lyf and ķat is by cause of fortune, 
as for ķei ben to pore and mowe not lyue cyuel lyf but ķei ben compelled to go out of ķe cite and tylye lond. 
Pe seconde, wherfore a man 
is som tyme not cyuel is passynge schrewednesse. 
For som men ben so euel willed ķat ķei mowe not lyue 
in a cyte 
by lawe and goķ 
ķerfore som tyme out of ķe citee. 
And if ķei gone not out, 
ķei ben som tyme iput out 
and somme tyme ibanesched. 
Primo [Polet]icorum <capitulo tercio>, 
þe philosofer speÞeķ 
of suche men and seide 
þat Omerus cursede hem and seide, 
Cursede be þe vnfelowlich man 
vnlaweful and mysdoere and desireþ cocky and is as it were wikoute k as bryddes and foules. 
Pe ķridde, 
som me lyuen not cyuel lif in cite for passynge good­ nesse. 
Cyuel lyf is good lyf 
and lif of wedloc 
is good lif to lyue as man. 
But som men ben so parfit ķat it is not inow to hem to lyue as men 
but þei forsaÞen wedlok 
and cyuel lyf 
and taÞen a more parfit lif. 
For þei he do wel þat wyuen and lyuen cyuel lif, 
ut he doþ bettere ķat wyuen not noķer lyuen cyuel lif for ķei 
w o l ķe more freliche lyue in Goddes seruyce 
and in contemplacioun. 
Panne man is kyndeliche a cyuel best not wikstondynge ķat som men lyuen not cyuel lyf. 
For eche man ķat lyuek not cyuel lyf, 
but it be for pouerte oķer for fortune, 
it is for he is a best 
and euel doere wikoute k 
and may not lyue 
vnder lawe noķer in companye; 
oķer he is as it were a god 
and cheseth ķe more parfit lyf. 
Perfore it is iwrete, primo Poleticorum, 
ķat he ķat may not comyne wiķ | 
oķere men noķer col. 
be in companye hath no part of a cite 
but he is a beeste oķer a god. 
v Chapter IV 
In ķe [nexte] chapitre ben contrarie obieccions and argumentes iput of by ķe whiche it semed ipreued ķat a cite 
is not kyndelich noķer man kyndelich a cyuel beste. 
Panne for it is not inow to putte of argumentes 
and contrarie obieccions 
ķat ben aenste certeyn soķenesses 
and trowÞe 
but ķer ben also propre resons 
ymaad to preue ķat soķenesses and trouthe, 
in this chapitre we thinÞen to maÞe resons to preue ķat a cite is som what by kynde and ķat a man is kyndeliche a cyuel beeste. 
And by twey weyes we may preue ķat a cyte 
is som what by kynde. 
Pe firste wey is itaÞe for a cyte ordeynek hous and strete. 
Pe seconde, 
for a cyte is ķe ende of hous and of strete, 
for Þey ben ymade 
for ķat ende to haue a cyte. Book III Parti A n d it is ipreued tofore ķat leuynge 
is kyndeliche to men 
and ķat kynde failleķ not to man 
in kynges 
þat ben nedful to suffisant lyuynge. 
Perfore al þat helpeþ 
to suffisaunt leuynge of mankynde 
mot be som what by kynde. 
Panne comynte of hous and comynte of strete ben kyndelich comyntees 
for þei helpen to suffisant lyuynge of mankynde. 
Panne for comynte of cite conteynek þes comyntees 
and helpeķ to suffisant leuynge more parfitliche þan doþ kylÞe comyntees, 
wherfore comynte of cite mot be kyndeliche comynte. 
Pe seconde wey is itaÞe for a cyte is ķe ende of ķe forseide comyntees 
and parfitnesse þerof. 
For as þe pholosofer argueķ, primo Polet­ icorum, 
ķe ende of generacioun of kyndeliche thinges 
is kyndelich 
and is ķe kynde of hem ķat ben igendred, 
as þe ende of generacioun | of f. man is kyndelich and his kynde. 
For þe ende of generacioun 
is ķe forme and schap 
and is kyndelich by a figure ķat hatte antonomasia, 
þe ende is þe silf kynde. 
A n d we seen also ķat comynte of hous 
is kyndeliche 
not onliche for it helpeth to suffisant leuynge 
but also for comyntees 
ķat maÞen hous parfit ben kyndeliche comyntees. 
And hous conteyneth comynte of housebonde and wif, 
of lord and seruant, 
of fader and sone, 
and eche þerof is kyndeliche comynte. 
Also comynte of strete is kyndelich comynte not onlyche 
for it helpeþ 
to suffisant leuynge but also for þe generacioun 
þerof is kyndelich. 
For a strete is igendred 
by encresyng of children and of nevewes, 
as þe philosofer meneķ, primo Poleticorum, 
wherfore if suche encresynge is kynde­ lich, 
a strete is also kyndelich. 
Panne a citee is kyndeliche 
for it is ķe ende of hous and strete; 
for it is þe ende of generacioun of kyndelich kynges, 
generacion of hous and strete is iordeyned to a cyte 
as to ķe ende and parfitnesse ķerof. 
For it is iknowe ķat a cyte 
is som what by kynde, 
it is to declarynge 
þat man is kyndeliche a cyuel beest and politik - ķat is to menynge desposed to d welle in cyte and in laweful comynte. 
A n d ķat we may also preue by twey weyes. 
Pe firste is itaÞe by speche. 
Pe seconde, 
by kynde inclinacioun. 
In ķe bygynnyng of þe seconde 
t is ipreued by speche ķat man is kyndelich a companable beest, 
for by speche we hauen techynge and loore. 
A n d heere we may preue by speche 
þat man is kyndelich politik and cyuel beest, 
for þe voyce of man 
þat is speche toÞeneth oþer 
wi|se þan vois of oķere beestes. Perfore ķe philosofer, primo col. Poleticorum, 
seith ķat in oķere bestes here 
kynde is so isette so 
ķat ķe voyse is so to hem tokne of likynge and displesyng so 
ķat by ķe voise ķei knowen plesynge and displesynge, 
for by ķe voyce it is iknowe 
wheÞer he be piesēd oķer greued. 
For ķe hound berÞeķ oķer wyse whanne he is iplesed 
ķanne whanne he is igreued, 
and by his berkyng oķer houndes knowen wheÞer he is iplesed oķer igreued. 
But here ouer man haķ speche 
by ķe whiche it is distinctlich iknowe what is r good and what is euel, 
what is ritful and what is wrong. 
Panne if comynte of hous is iordeyned 
for to haue ķat is good 
and to voide euel and ķerouer comynte of cyte 
is iordeyned 
to haue rit and to voyde wrong, 
comynte of hous and of cite mot be kynde comynte. 
For if kynde eueķ men speche kyndeliche, 
it is ķe comynte 
ķat is iordeyned 
to kynges ķat scholde be treted by speche. 
And rit and wronge is not propreliche 
in comynte of hous 
but in comynte of cite. 
For in a cyte 
where inne citeseyns hauen propre possessions and distincte [ben] ofte plee and stryif, 
what is right and what is wrong, 
and ķat is not proprelich 
in an hous ķere alle thinges longeķ to the housebonde. 
Cyte and hous ben diuerse 
for in a cite 
is not onliche thing 
ķat helpeķ and greueþ 
but also socour of rigt and of wrong. 
But eyÞer comynte is kynde comynte, 
bothe comynte of hous and of cite, 
for by speche þat we hauen of kynde 
we knowen good and euel, rit and wrong. 
Pe seconde wey to preue þe same 
is itaÞe by kynde inclinación, 
for alle bestes haķ kynde inclinacioun to saue kynges 
ķat ķei hauen of | f. kynde. 
Wherfore if kynde eueķ man leuynge, 
he eueķ hym kynde inclinacioun to do thinges 
by ķe whiche 
he may haue suffisant leuynge. 
And ķe philosofer seith 
that ķat may be best 
by comynte of cite, 
for a cyte scholde conteyne al ķat nedeķ to ķe lyf. 
Panne men hauen kynde 
inclynacioun to lyfe politik lif, 
laweful comynte, 
and to maÞe a cyte. 
But for thing ķat we desiren kyndeliche 
is sum 
what kyndelich and by kynde, 
a cytee moot be som what kyndelich and by kynde. ii Chapter V By ķre weyes we may preue ķat passynge comynte of cyte 
it is profitable to lif % of mankynde 
to ordeyne comynte of regne. 
Pe firste wey is itaÞe 
by suffisaunt leuyng; 
ķe seconde, 
by hauynge of vertues; 
ķe ķridde, 
by defence and wikstondynge of enemyes. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For ķe philosofer seith, primo Poleticorum, 
ķat parfit comynte ķat is a cyte imaad of manye stretes 
is ende of al ķat suffiseth 
by itself to ķe lif. 
And schal not be soo vnderstonde ķat alwey 
a cytee haþ 
of þe propre possessions 
þerof al þat nedeþ to þe lif 
but it is inow 
þat a cyte be so isette 
þat it may haue a suffisant leuynge 
by marchaundise and by cariage 
and by wyt of mankynde. 
Panne as a strete 
þat hath smyÞes craft 
haþ nede to a strete ķat haķ webbe craft, 
for to suffisaunt leuynge men neden boþe smethes and webbes, 
so for som cytees hauen inow of oon manere thing 
for somme citee hauen wyne inow and lacÞen corn 
and oþere citées hauen corn inow, 
oo citee nedeþ helpe of anoþer. 
Wherfore as it is profitable 
to þe lif of mankynde to haue diuerse stretes in oon cytee | col. 
for to haue þe sonnere 
what nedeþ to ķe lif, 
so it is profitable to haue v Book III 
Parti many citées vnder on principate oķer on regne ķat ķei mowe ķe better helpe eche oķer of thinges 
ķat nedeķ to ķe lif. 
For as diuerse lymes of ķe bodye hauen not ķe same doynge 
but oon nedeķ doynge of anoķer wherfore it is good 
ķat ķe lymes be ifere in o body 
ķat ķei mowe helpe eche oķer, 
so not for aile citées hauen píente of ķe same thinges, 
it is good ķat citées be vnder oo regne ķat ķei mowe ķe bettere helpe eche oķer of kynges 
ķat nedeķ to sufficiant leuynge. 
Pe seconde wey to preue ķe same is itaÞe by hauynge of vertues. 
For ķe entent of hym ķat eueķ lawe 
as it is iseid tofore scholde not onliche be for citeseyns scholde haue what nedeķ to helpe at bodilich nede, 
but also ķei scholde lyue by lawe and vertuousliche. 
A n d ķe betere ķe soule 
is passyng ķe body 
and more vertuous worÞes passen outward gode, 
ķe more ķ'entent of hym ķat euen ķe lawe scholde be for to lyue vertuousliche. 
Panne ķe rector of a citee mot haue cyuyl myt and power 
ķat he may compelle hem ķat w o l not lyue vertuous­ liche 
and hem ķat disturblen ķe pees 
and good astaat of ķe citeseyns. 
For euele men in a citee dar not arise aenste ķe prince 
if ķei knowen ķat he hath greet cyuel myt and power and lordschipe of manye citées. 
if it is iknowe ķat a prince rewlek ritfulliche 
and bycomek not a tyrand, 
it is spedful to citeseyns 
for to lyue vertuousliche 
and for schrewednesse of euel men 
to be gedered vnder oo regne. 
But if ķe prince 
w o l be a tyrand, 
ķe lasse myt and power 
he hath ķe better it 
is for ķe cytee. 
Pe ķridde | wey to preue ķe same is itaÞe by defense and wikstond- f. ynge of enemyes. 
For we seen ķat whanne a citee is ouersette 
w i k enemyes 
and maÞeķ confederacioun and couenant wiķ anoķer citee 
ķat he may ķe better withstonde ķe rees of enemyes; 
ķanne for a regne 
is as it were a confideracioun 
and couenant of manye citées for to be ioned vnder o kyng ķat schal defende eche partie of ķe regne and ordeyne cyuel myt and power of oķere citées to defence of eche cytee of ķe regne 
if it is ouersette wik strangers, 
for ķe better defence and socoure it is good 
of many comyntees of citées 
to ordeyne oon comynte of a regne. 
r Chapter VI 
We may assigne twey manere generacions 
of citee and of regne and eiķer ķerof 
is kyndeliche in som wise; 
nathalees ķe oon is more kyndelich ķan ķe oķer. 
Of ķe firste manere we made mencioun in ķe seconde book, ķere we seide ķat 
by encresynge of children, sones, and nevewes, 
anj hous may encrese in to a strete and a strete in to a cite 
and a cite in to a regne. 
Anoķer manere is by accord of hem 
ķat maÞen a citee oķer a regne. 
For as ķe philosofer reherseth, 
i i Poleticorum, 
in oolde tyme men wonede fer atwynne, 
as in Aristotles tyme, 
and ķat was amonge certeyne 
men ķat weren icleped Archades - 
among hem eche wonede by hymself. 
Pan men ķat wonede so desparkled accordeden in a tyme 
and made hem a cytee and wonede ķerinne ķat ķei myte ķe bettere haue what nedeķ to help to ķe lyfe. 
Panne a regne myte be maad in ķis wise [i]f manye citées and townes dreden | myt of enemyes and col. accorden to be vnder kyng. 
EyÞer of ķis maners is kyndelich, 
but ķe firste is more kyndeliche ķan ķe seconde. 
Pe firste makynge of cite 
and of regne is kyndeliche in double wise. First, 
for it is imaad 
by generacioun ķat Jis work of kynde. 
Pe seconde, 
for men hauen kynde inclinacioun 
to maÞe citee and regne. 
öif children and nevewes encresen in on hous by generacioun so ķat ķei mowe not dwelle al ifere ķerinne and maÞen hem many howses and so ķei maÞe a strete and cresseķ more and more so ķat ķei may not dwelle al in oon strete and maÞeķ hem many stretes and maÞen so citées and maÞen many citees 
and maÞen so a regne, 
% suche makynge of citee and of regne is most kyndelich not onlich for men hauen kynde inclinacioun to suche makyng 
but also for suche makynge comeķ a generacioun of children 
ķat is work of kynde. 
Pe seconde manere makynge of regne and of citee is whan men accorden to suche makynge 
and suche makynge is kyndeliche. 
Pei it be not kyndeliche 
as ķe firste manere makynge, 
nathales it is kynde­ lich. 
For by cause of leuynge men hauen kynde inclinacioun 
and accorden to maÞe a citee 
in ķe whiche is suffisant leuynge; 
and hauen also kynde inclinacioun 
to maÞe a principate and a regne, 
for by suche makynge ķei mowe lyue ķe better in pees 
and ķe bettere wikstonde here enemyes ķat wolde rese on hem wik violence. 
Panne suche inclynacioun is kyndelich; 
for as men hauen kynde inclinacioun to lyue and to haue suffisant lyuynge and ķat is by companye of cite, 
so ķei hauen kynde inclinacioun 
to lyue in pees 
and to wikstonde litliche here enemyes. 
| And ķat is by companye of principate and of regne, 
for f. i we seen ķat citées 
ķat ben not vnder kyng hauen ofte greet discord 
and stryf eche wiķ oķer. 
For twey maners of generacions of citee and of regne 
ben ireÞened and eyÞer ķerof 
may be cleped kyndelich maner of generacioun of cite and of regne, 
we may adde ķe ķridde manere ķat is as it were sympliche violent. 
For whan men wonede disparpled, 
on myte arise by tyrandise 
and be lord ouer hem by violence; 
and whanne he were lord ouer hem, 
he myte gadere hem by violence 
and maÞe hem 
maÞe a citee. 
Also a regne myte be imaad 
by violence 
and by tyrandise 
as if oon lord of citee 
ouersetteķ by tyrandise, 
by cyuel myt and power, 
and maÞen hemself kyng ķerof. 
v Book III Parti It is iknowe ķat ķer ben diuers maneres of generacioun of cite and of regne 
and it is to wetynge 
in how many parties ķe ķridde book mot be departed in ķe whiche we schal trete 
of al suche rewelyng. 
Hit is declared ķat kynde generacioun of citee and of regne is iordeyned to lyue wel 
and to lyue in pees 
and to withstonde enemyes 
ķat wolde desturble ķe pees and ouersette and taÞe citées. 
It is to declaryng 
how a citee and a regne myte 
wel be irewled in tyme of [pees, 
and how enemyes m y t e be assaied 
i n t y m e of] werre. 
But as ķe philosofer seith, 
ii Methaphisicorum, 
and aboute ķe ende Elenarum, 
no man suffiseth to hymsilf to fynde art in craft but eche mot be holpe 
by helpe of hem ķat soute tofore som knowynge of suche art. 
Perfore in suffisant art of rewelyng of citee and of regne it 
nedeķ to reherce what philosofrers 
in oold tyme menede 
of suche rewelyng | 
and how cytees were ireweled col. 
in olde tyme, 
for Þerby we schal be lad 
in som wise 
to knowe what is good 
and what is not good 
in rewelynge of regne and of citee. 
Panne aile ķis ķridde book 
we schal dele in ķre parties, 
for firste we schal telle opynyons of philosofres in rewelyng of citées 
and what ķei seide amys 
in suche rewlyng schal be repreued. 
Panne first, 
we scholde reherse ordenance 
of olde philosofres 
in suche rewelinge ķat kynges and princes mowe be lad Þerby 
how ķei scholde rewele citées and règnes. 
Pe seconde, 
it schal be declared 
whiche is best policie and rewelyng 
and what cautels princes scholde vse 
and how citee and regne scholde be rew[el]ed in tyme of pees for suffisaunt and vertuous leuynge. 
Pe ķridde, 
it schal be declared how figtynge men scholde be chose 
and h o w enemyes scholde be assaied and how schiltroms in bataille scholde be iordeyned 
and what cautels figtyng men scholde vse aenst enemyes in mortel batailles. Chapter VII 
While Socrates traueillede long in philosofie 
and aboute kyndes of thinges and seye ķat in natural science is greet difficulté, 
as ķe philoso fer telleķ in Metaphisica sua, 
he turnede hym to moral matere. 
A n d his disciple Plato folwede hym in manye doynges 
and [ pe p h i l o s o f e r ] 
clepede ķerfore Plato ķe seconde Socrates. 
Socrates and Plato tretede of moral matere 
and touchede of fyue poyntes of cite and of rewelyng of cite. First, ķei seide ķat a citee scholde be most oon, 
and trowede so oon 
caas for alwey multitude comeķ of vnyte and alwey vnyte semeth betere ķan multitude. 
Perfore for | G 
o d is most oon, 
it is argued ķat he f. is most good; 
ķanne it semeķ 
ķat a citee is most good gif it is most oon. 
Panne ķe more it drawek to vnyte, 
ķe more it neieth to ķe ende of goodnesse. 
r Pe seconde, 
ķe forseyde philosofers 
ordeyned reulyng of cite and seide ķat alle kynges scholde be comyne to ķe citeseyns 
so ķat alle possessions and wyues scholde be comyn so ķat eche man scholde taÞe eche womman 
and so ķe children scholde be comyn. 
For by cause of comyne vse of wymmen, 
ķe faders scholde be not certeyn 
of here owne children; 
but he scholde trowe ķat alle children 
were here owne children. 
For Socrates and Plato menede ķat al ķe stryf of citeseyns 
comeķ of propre possessions, 
for eche fondeķ to saye ķis is myn. 
Wherfore ķei argewede 
if possessions were comyne and citeseyns hadde nout in propre, 
plee and stryf scholde cese and so a citee were best yordeyned. 
Also ķei wolde ķat wifes scholde be comyne, 
for ķerof scholde come loue most among citeseyns. 
For if ķe wifes were not propre but comyne, 
ķanne ķe children scholde be comyn; 
and for fadres louen best here owne children, 
in ķat citee scholde be most loue 
for ķe elder men 
schulde loue al ķe ongere men 
as here owne children 
and ķe onger men 
scholde loue al ķe eldere men 
as here owne fadres. 
A n d also ķei seide ķat wifes and children 
scholde wel lyue 
in ķat wise to haue most vnyte and acord in ķe citee. 
For by cause of most vnyte and most acord is bytwene fadres and childdren, 
ķat olde men wolde trowe ķat ķei hadde most acord 
wiķ ķe ongere men 
and aenward for ķe eldere men | wolde trowe ķat ongere men were here col. owne children 
and ķe ongere wolde trowe 
ķat ķe eldere were here owne fadres. 
Pe ķridde, 
in rewelyng of citee ķe forseide philosofres seide ķat wymmen scholde lerne dedes of armes and fite in bataille as men doķ. 
And as ķe philosofer seith, 
ii Poleticorum, 
ķei broute herto doynge of oķere bestes and foules; 
for ķei seye doyng of oķere beestes 
in ķe whiche not onlich maal 
and femel fioteķ 
but also in beestes 
and in foules 
ķat leuen by raueyne 
ķe femel 
is more strong ķan ķe maal. 
For if we taÞen heede of foules 
ķat lyuen by raueyne, 
ķe femel is more greet of body 
and more blood of herte ķan ķe male, 
as it fareth of ķe goshauk, 
of ķe faucoun, 
and of ķe egle, 
and of oķere suche 
and of suche feméis 
ķat ben more worthi ķanne here owne mawles. 
Wherfore ¡f we seyen among oķere beestes ķat not onliche ķe maal fiteķ 
but also ķe femal for it semeķ most by % ķe ordre of kynde in ķe whiche we comynen with oķere beestes, 
it semeķ ķat a cite i[s] most kyndelich yordeyned gif not onliche men 
ben iordeyned to do dedes of armes 
but also wymmen. 
Pe ferķe, 
ķei seide ķat alwey ķe same men 
scholde be princes and officers in a citee so ķat ķei ķat were officers 
scholde alwey be officers 
and ķei ķat were meyres 
scholde alwey be meyres 
and so of oķer officers and baylefs. 
A n d ķei toÞe ensaumple of ķe erķe, 
for we seen ķat partes of ķe erķe ķat hauen a veyn of syluer hauen alwey suche a veyn 
and ķe parties ķat hauen a veyn of gold 
hauen alwey suche a Book III Parti veyn. 
Panne gif kynde turneķ 
not a veyne of gold 
in to a veyn ļ of siluer f. noķer in to a veyn of iren noķer agenward, 
we doun wel gif we folwen doynge of worÞes of kynde. 
A n d nameliche a citee is wel ireweled gif we folwen ķe ordre of kynde 
and change not ķe veyn of gold as ķe grete princes 
and ķe veyne of siluer as ķe lasse princes 
in to a veyn of ire so 
ķat ķe grete princes 
scholde not be sette doun 
noķer imaad sogette. 
Pe fifte, ķe forseide philosofres seide ķat eche cite scholde be deled in fif parties: 
plowg men, craftes men, men of armes, consaillours and princes. 
And ķei seide ķat plowg men were nedful to ķe citee for thinges 
ķat nedeķ to mete and drynÞe. 
Craftes men ben nedful for clokynge and hous 
and oķere thinges 
ķat nedeķ to ķe lif. 
A n d worrious ben nedful for defence of ķe citee 
and for to putte of enemyes. 
A n d ķei seide ķat a cite gif it were wel iordeyned most haue a ķousand fityng men atte leste and fif ķousand atte moste. 
And princes and consaillours 
ben nedful in a citee for to rewle ķe citeseins 
to lyue vertuousliche 
and to Þepe 
w e l ķe lawe. 
A n d ķe forseide philosofres toucheķ oķere poyntes of rewelyng % of citee of ķe whiche mencioun schal be maad gif we fynden place. Chapter VIII 
Most euenest equalite and vnite nedeķ not to be in al kynges; 
for gif al kynges were euene peres, 
ķanne ķei were nougt al thinges. 
A n d for to haue al kynges 
ķat nedeķ for to 
maÞe ķe world 
most parfit in ķe state ķerof, 
it nedeķ to haue thinges of diuerse kynde. 
For ķe hole good­ nesse of ķe world 
may not be to saue i n on maner kynde, 
it nedeķ to haue kynges of diuerce kynde; 
for i n kynges of manye maner kynde [ben] Þepte and isaued more perfeccioun ķanne onlich 
in a kyng of on kynde. 
Also a citee for to be parfite it nedeķ to haue som diuersete 
and it nedeķ not to haue ķer|inne al manere euenesse (equalite) and col. accordas Socrates and Plato wolde mené. 
And, ii Poleticorum, 
ķe philos ofer toucheķ 
as it were sex resons preuyng ķat it nedeķ not ķat a citee 
be most oon and most accordynge. 
Pe first is itaÞe 
by beynge of ķe cite. 
Pe seconde, 
by comparisoun to an oost. 
Pe ķridde, 
by comparisoun to ķe partyes. 
Pe ferķe, 
to comparisoun to princes and sogettes. 
Pe fifte, 
by comparisoun to ķe ende. 
Pe sexte, 
by comparisoun to kynges ķat we seen in oķere tuenes, acorde and melodye. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wyse, 
for on singuler man haķ more vnyte ķan al an hous and an hous more ķan a strete and a strete more ķan a citee 
and a citee more ķan a regne; 
for an hous is maad of many persones 
and a strete of many houses 
and a citee of many stretes 
and a regne of manye citées. 
Panne gif an hous 
were so ioned ķat al ķe persones 
ķerof were oo persone, 
ķan were it not on hous 
but a r r r v singuler man. 
Also if a strete were so ioned 
ķat it were on hous, 
ķanne were it not a strete. 
And in ķe same wise [i]f a citee were so iooned 
ķat it were oon strete oķer on hous, 
ķanne it were no citee, 
for in a citee nedeķ diuersite; 
and if ķat diuersite failleķ, 
ķe cite is no citee. 
Panne it is al oon to saye ķat in a citee oķer 
in a regne schulde be al manere vnyte 
and to saye ķat a cite is no citee 
and ķat a regne is no regne. 
Pe seconde wey to preue ķe same is itaÞe 
by comparisoun to an oost 
or to fitynge men arayed to fite. 
For as it is iseid, 
i i Poleticorum, 
suche arayunge and cite ben diuerse; 
for suche araye is more profitable and lasse profitable 
as it is more oķer lasse ķei it be ķe same kyng in kynde, 
for suche araye is imaad 
by cause | of help and socour. 
For as f. i manye men trauelen a schip betere ķan oon ķei ķilÞe manye men be al of oon manere and ileche and accordynge, 
so manye men fatten bettere ķan oon. 
A n d it is not so of a citee 
but a cite is iordeyned for suffisant lyuynge. 
Panne for vs nedeķ dyuerse kynges for oure leuynge, 
in a cytee moot be diuersetee. 
Pe ķridde wey declarynge 
for ķe forseide weyes 
is itaÞe 
to comparisoun of ķe parties. 
For as ķe same bodye 
nedeķ dyuerse doynges 
as goynge, touchinge, sit and huyrynge, 
ķerfore in ķe bodye 
nedeķ diuerse membres 
and lymes for dyuerse doynges. 
So for to oure leuynge vs nedeķ hous, clokynge, mete, 
and drynÞe, 
and oķere suche, 
in a citee mot be som diuersete for to haue ķerinne suffisant leuynge. 
Panne as if no diuersetee were in membres of ķe body, 
as if aile ķe membres were eyene, 
ķe body were vnparfit; 
for ķei he myte see, 
he myt noķer huyre ne goo. 
So gif most liknesse and acord were in a cytee so ķat if alle were webbes 
oķer alle coriours, 
ķe citee were vnparfit. 
For to suffisaunt leuynge vs nedeķ 
not onlich schone and clothynge 
but also vs nedeķ 
mete and drynÞe and hous 
and oķere thinges 
ķat nedeķ to ķe lif. 
Pe ferķe wey is itaÞe 
by comparisoun to prynces and sogettes. 
For by cause ķat a cite is a manere ordre of citeseyns 
to a certeyn prince and lord, 
and for in a citee mot be certeyn officers and maistres lasse and more 
and ķat may not be 
but som were lordes and somme sogettes, 
and for ķis nedeķ dyuersete, 
in a citee mot be som dyuersetee. 
Pe fifte wey is itaÞe 
by comparisoun to ķe ende 
wherfore ķe citee is imaad, 
| for ķe citee is imaad 
for to lyue wel 
and to haue suffisant coi. leuynge. 
For a citee is a comyntee 
ķat hath ende of al ķat is of itsilf suffisant lyuynge, 
but as it is iseid 
to suffisant leuynge 
nedeķ dyuerse thinges, 
ķerfore in a citee [ben] sum diuersetee and diuerse stretes 
as it is spedful to ķe lif so ķat thinges 
ķat ben not ifounde in oo strete 
may be founde in anoķer. 
Pe sexte wey is itaÞe in comparisoun to tuenes and melodye. 
For melodye ķat is ķe multitude of voyce 
is neuere wel proporciónate gif alle ķe voices ben euene ileche; 
but to good melodye nedeķ diuersete r Book III Parti of tuenes. 
Also peynture is neuere wel iordeyned 
but ķerinne be di­ uerse colours. 
So a cite is neuere wel iordeyned 
but ķerinne be diuerse officers. 
Panne kynges and princes scholde knowe ķat 
in a cite scholde be dyuersete, 
for neuere man can rewle wel a citee 
but he knowe how a cite is iordeyned 
and how ķerinne mot be diuersetee. Chapter IX 
In principlis speche mot be long, 
for a litel errour in ķe bygynnyng 
is most in ķe endyng. 
Perfore principles 
mot be longe itreted 
and declared with long speche 
lest errour falle ķere among. 
Wherfore by cause ķat in rewelyng 
of citee first polici and manere of rewelyng mot be iordeyned, 
it mot be long itreted and declared how a citee 
mot be oon 
and what diuersete 
mot be ķerinne 
and how citeseyns schal bere hemself 
eche to oķer and wheÞer alle kynges scholde be comyn to hem oķer no 
and what ķei scholde haue propre. 
For ķese ben 
as it were certeyn principles 
and preambules to kynges ķat schal be preched. 
A n d in ķis chapitre first we | 
w o l declare ķat it nedeķ not to alle f. thinges be comyne 
in a cite as Socrates ordeyned 
noķer thinges folwen ķat Socrates seide gif a citee were so iordeined. 
For ļ he trowede ķat gif alle possessions, 
wyues and children were comyne ķanne ķei scholde al strif and plee ceese, 
and gif citeseyns trowede ķat alle children 
were here owne children 
ķanne scholde be most loue in ķe citee. 
By ķre weyes we may declare ķat ķis 
is not spedful to ķe citee: 
first, 
for strif and plee scholde not ceese; 
ķe seconde, 
for citeseyns wolde not trowe 
ķat alle children were here owne; 
ķe ķridde, 
for among hem were not most loue. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For were possessions neuere so comyne, 
gut ķe vse of kynges 
ķat longeķ to ķe liflode scholde be propre; 
for as it may not be ķat gif aile ķe citeseyns 
were on real body imaad, 
so it may not be ķat ķe same mete ķat norescheķ 
ķe body of oon citeseyn scholde noresche ķe body of anoķer. 
And gif possessions were comyn, 
it were nede to dele 
to eche thinges 
ķat ķat nedeķ 
to sustenaunce of ķe body. 
A n d for a man 
is gretliche disceyued 
in his owne propre profit, 
alwey it wolde seme hym ķat he scholde fonge more ķan ķei fongen. 
And for it is inposcible 
ķat alle citeseyns 
be liehe good and liehe wys and redy 
and iliche profitable to ķe cite, 
anon ķere scholde arise stryf among citeseyns. 
For eche scholde trowe ķat ķei scholde fonge more ķan ķei fongen, 
for on citeseyn wolde holde hymself better 
ķanne anoķer 
and wolde be rewarded 
as ķei were worthi. 
A n d it were not poscible 
to Þepe suche euenesse 
and | equalite col. 
among citeseyns 
wikoute stryf and plee, 
for eche is disceyued 
and teilen mor of hemself ķan of anoķer. 
Panne comyn possessions ķat v Socrates ordeyned for to voide strif scholde be more cause of strif ķan pees. 
For, 
as we towchede tofore in ķe seconde book, 
haue nout in propre 
is ķe lif of parfit men 
and fewe men ben parfit. 
A n d lawe ķat scholde be eue to alle citeseyns 
and to aile ķe puple schulde be suche 
by ķe whiche men myte leue comynliche; 
and [in] Poleticfis] ķe phi­ losofer seith ķat citeseyns scholde not be applied to lawes 
but lawes scholde be applied to citeseyns, 
for lawes and ordenaunce of citee scholde be accordyng to al ķe puple and to ķe comyn lyuynge. 
And so is not ķe ordenaunce of Socrates, 
for it myt not be iÞepte withoute greet stryf among men 
ķat lyuen in comynte. 
A n d ut ķei possessions 
myte be comyn withoute strif, wifes and children 
myte not be comyne 
as Socrates wolde mené withoute strif. 
Pe seconde wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For gif alle thinges were comyne, 
it neded not to alle citesens trowe 
ķat alle children ben here owne; 
but for som children scholde be liehe 
to somme citeseyns 
and somme to oķere, 
eche citeseyn wolde taÞe for his owne childe ķe childe ķat were leche to hym. Perfore, ii Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer telleķ, 
as it is iseid 
in ķe seconde book, 
among som nacions wyues ben comyne 
but ķe citeseyns departen ķe children by liknesse; 
for eche of hem taÞen 
for his owne children 
ķe children ķat ben ileche to hem. 
For so it fareķ 
among oķere bestes 
ķat manye femeles bryngek | fork brood liehe to ķe fadres - 
as ķe philosofer telleķ, 
in ķe lond of Salaria 
was a certeyn mare 
and alle wey here colt was liehe to ķe fader, 
and ķerfore ķe mare was icleped Iusta, ritful. 
Panne ķei wyues were comyne, 
ut were not ķat profit ķat Socrates trowede ķat citeseyns scholde trow ķat alle children were here owne. 
Pe ķridde wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For Þey wyues were comyne, 
scholde not be so greet loue 
in a citee as Socrates wolde mené, 
for of litel kynrade ķat is certeyne 
and iknowe comeķ more loue ķan 
of gret kynrade ķat 
is in doute and vnknowe. 
For Þey ķe fader and sone be nere sibbe ķanne ķe eme, 
gif ķei knewe ķat a child is his neuew, 
wolde loue hym bettre ķan ķe fader wolde loue ķe sone gif he were skylfulliche in doute 
wheÞer he were his sone oķer no. 
A n d now is more doute 
in a citee as ķe philosofer seith, ii Poleticorum, 
ķat oon loueķ anoķer as his sone, 
anoķer an noķer 
as his broÞer, 
anoķer anoķer as his nevew, 
anoķer as his ernes sone 
and anoķer as his kynnes man, 
and so is more loue ķanne is ķe loue ķat Socrates setteķ. 
For of litel kynrade ķat is certeyn 
and iknowe comeķ more loue ķan of ķe kynrade ķat 
is bytwene fader 
and sone gif it is in doute and vnknowe 
as ķe philosofer meneķ, 
ķanne ķe comynte ķat Socrates setteķ 
is not spedful to a cite. 
Panne kynges and princes scholde besyliche taÞe hede to könne so ordeyne a cytee 
as it is spedful 
to ķe comynte of citeseyns. 
f. i r Book III Parti Chapter X Secundo Polleticorum, 
ķe philosofer preueķ 
ķat manye harmes 
scholde sewe in | a citee 
if wyfes and children were comyne. 
And as it col. longeķ 
to ķis doynge 
we may reÞene fyue harmes 
ķat ķe philosofer toucheķ ķere ķat scholde come 
of suche comynte. 
Pe firste härme is wrong of kynnes men; 
ķe seconde, despisyng of gentel men; 
ķe ķridde, forgendryng of children; 
ķe ferķe, intemporatnesse of lecherie; 
ķe fifte, mysvsynge of fader and moder in lecherie. 
Pe firste is declared in ķis wise. 
For in a cytee mot arise strif and wondes and despisynge 
and ķe nere sibbe ķe persone is ķat is in strif, wounded and despised, 
ķe worse ben ķe strif, wondes and despisyng. 
Panne for goodnesse and honeste of maneres 
it is spedful to a cite ķat faders and moders be certeyn of here owne children 
and ķat alle men ben certeyn of here owne cosynes and kynnes men leste ķer falle stryf and wrong and dispisynge by vnknowynge 
bytwene children 
and fader and moder, cosyns and kynnes men. 
Wherfore by cause ķat ķe comynte of wymmen ķat Socrates ordeyned 
bynemek certeynetee of children 
and knowyng of kynnes men, 
it is not to preisyng; 
for ķerof it folwek ķat 
by vnknowyng som men 
mygte sone doun wrong 
to here owne cosyns and kynnes men. 
Pe seconde harme is declared in ķis wise. 
For gif wifes and children were comyn, gentel men scholde be despised 
and plowg men 
and foule persones scholde be worschepped. For wyues and children myte not be comyne 
but children of gentil men and wardeynes of citées and of plow men 
and foule persones 
hadde ķe same Þepynge. 
Wherfore children of gentil men scholde be despised 
and children of foule persones iworscheped. 
Panne | were no frendschipe among f. citeseyns, 
for [in] Ethidts] ķe philosofer seith ķat euene proporcioun [/ destroyep] frendschepe. 
Panne for good men and worthi ben aboue foule men and vnworthi, 
bytwene hem [is] frendschipe 
whan eche hath hemself in proporcioun 
after his owne staat 
as whanne vnnoble men seruen noble men and noble men quyten hem by proporcioun of here seruyce. 
Panne it is al oon to desire ķat children of citeseyns be comyne, 
and haue liehe good Þepyng and charge of children 
of noble men 
and of vnnoble men; 
and to despise noble men 
and to worschepe vnnoble men 
and not saue frendschipe 
among hem al is oon. 
Pe ķridde harm is declared in ķis wise. 
For of suche comyntee comeķ forgendryng of children. 
For, viii Ethicorum, 
ķe philosofer seith ķat noon 
is frend to manye in parfit frendschipe noķer louen manye persones passyngliche, 
for passyng loue 
is more sette in oon ķanne in manye. 
Perfore in ķe same book 
ķe philosofer concludeķ ķat it is not 
ethe passyngliche to píese manye. 
Wherfore if eche citeseyn trowede ķat alle children were his owne, 
his loue were ilost; 
for among v so manye he scholde louye ech 
but litel and recche ful litel of eche. 
Also no citeseyn 
but he were a fool mygte trowe ķat alle ķe children were his owne. 
Panne gif he louede alle children 
as his owne, 
ķat were by cause of tweyne oķer ķre ķat he trowede ķat were his owne. 
A n d for thilÞe ben not certeynliche iknowe to hym, 
Socrates trowede ķat he wolde loue 
alle ķe oķere 
by cause of hem. 
But as ķe philosofer argewek, 
ii [Poletjicorum, 
it is al oon to desyre to louye 
a gret multitude of children 
as his owne children 
by cause of tweyne oķere 
of | fewe col. children 
and to do a lytel hony in moche water. 
For as a litel hony mygte not maÞe 
al a ryuer swete, 
so loue of twey children 
oķer of ķre mygte not maÞe endeles manye children 
in a cite plesynge 
and hertilich iloued. 
But gif citeseyns louede not children, ķanne children scholde not be wel iÞept noķer with besinesse. 
Pe ferķe harme is declared in ķis wise. 
For ķe vertue of generacioun is [/korrupte and so ķe appetite haķ neuere inow and ķeig a man haue but on wif, 
it is ful hard for hym bere hym wel and temporatliche to ķat oon. 
Panne as whanne glotonye is excited 
by multitude of metes 
it is hard to be abstinent, 
so whanne lecherie is excited 
by multitude of wymmen 
it is hard 
and as it were inposcible 
to be temporate. 
Pe fifķe harm may be declared in ķis wise. For gif fadres and moders 
knowen not here owne, 
sones and dougtres ligtliche may be mysvsynge in lecherie 
with fader and moder and cosyns 
so 
ķat ķe sones wolde taÞe ķe moders 
and ķe faders ķe dougters. 
But Socrates wolde voyde ķis inconuenient and seide ķat it longeķ 
to ķe rector of ķe citee to haue charge and besynesse 
ķat ķe sones do no lecherie 
by ķe moders 
noķer ķe faders by ķe dougtres. 
But as ķe philosofer seith, 
ķis [is] not inow; 
for gif sones and dougtres were comyne 
and knewe not here owne fadres and moders, ķei ķe sone were forbode to do ķe dede of lecherie 
with his moder and fater wik his dougter, 
gut is not loue of lust of likynge of lecherie 
for ķat kynrade 
is not schewed to hem. 
Panne for betwene so nyg sibbe persones not onliche ķe dede of lech­ erie is euel and detestable 
but also lust and likynge is horrible, 
Socrates his opynyoun 
was to blame of comynte of wifes | and of children. 
Panne kynges and princes scholde so ordeyne a citee and forbede comynte of wifes and of children 
for fadres and modres scholde be certeyne of here owne children. Chapter XI Secundo Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer seith ķat alle thinges to be comyn 
may be vnderstonde 
in ķre manere wise. 
For in thinges ķat seruen to liflode tweyne mot be knowe: 
ķinges ķat beren fruyt as feldes, vyngerdes, and treen, 
and fruyt ķat comeķ ķerof as wyn, corn and apples. 
Panne gif suche thinges 
ben comyn to citesens, 
kynges ķat beren fruyt f. i r Book III 
Parti ben comyne and fruyt is gadred in comyne. 
And so it was in olde tyme among certeyne nacions, 
as ķe philosofer reherseth, 
oķer ei[ķe]re is comyne, kynges ķat bereķ fruit 
and ķe fruit ķerof, 
as Socrates ordeynede. 
For as it is iseid tofore, 
he wolde mené ķat gif 
no thing were propre in a citee, 
noķer possessioun noķer fruyt noķer children noķer wyues, 
no stryf scholde arise in ķe citee. 
A n d ķe philosofer seith 
at ķe first sigt ķis ordinaunce of Socrates 
semeķ ful spedful to a citee; 
for whanne a man hireth 
ķat a cite 
is so iordeyned 
in ķe whiche is so greet comynte of citeseyns, 
Þey wenen ķat ķe cite is in welthe 
and in felicite and trowek 
ķat ķe citeseyns louen eche other atte beste and leuen withoute strif for among hem 
is so greet comynte iÞepte. 
But as it is iseid, 
ii Poleticorum, 
in particuler doynge it 
nedeķ to vse experience and assay, 
we hauen iseid ķat 
[m]e ķat hauen thinges in comyne hauen more stryf among hemsilf ķan gif eche hadde his owne in propre possessioun. 
And by ķre weyes we may preue ķat gif 
alle kynges 
were comyne to citeseyns, 
more strif | scholde rise in ķe col. 
cite ķan ķer scholde gif eche hadde his owne proper possessioun. 
Pe firste wey is itaÞe by comyn possessioun; ķe seconde, 
by parteners of suche thinges; 
ķe ķridde, 
by vneuenesse of citeseyns. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For whanne a thing is comyne to diuerse men, 
gif oon is ilette 
by anoķer of vse and [flrute of ķat comyne thing, 
ķanne ķere ariseķ strif 
and discord bytwene hem. 
For we seen ķat breķerne of on wombe hauen greet strif 
and plee for comyne heritage 
ķat ķei hauen gif ķe oon vseķ not ķat heritage 
as it semeķ to ķe oķer ķat it is spedful. 
Panne gif breķerne of o wombe 
ķat ben fewe and trowen siÞerliche ķat ķei be so nyg sibbe hauen gret strif for comyn heritage, 
moche more among alle citeseyns gif alle thinges were comyn to hem gret strif scholde arise for ķei ben manye and of diuers wille and beķ not so nyg sibbe 
as breķeren of on wombe. 
For if it were as Socrates seide ķat alle citeseyns 
for comynte of wymmen and of wifes wolde trowe 
ķat he nyg were sibbe, 
git ķeig he were so nyg sibbe in dede 
as breķeren of oon wombe, 
git ķat sibrade mygte not be certeynliche iknowe 
as it is ipreued tofore. 
Panne gif certeyn sibrade benemeķ not strif 
bytwene fewe men ķat hauen comyn heritage, 
moche more vncerteyne sibrade migte not byneme strif among alle citeseyns. 
Pe seconde wey to preue ķe same 
is itaÞe by partyners in comyn heritage. 
For ķe more men hauen in comyn, 
ķe more ķei mote be ifere. 
But men m o w not be swithe longe ifere but strif aryse bytwene hem. 
By partyners in comyne heritage, 
| for ķei mot be moche ifere comynlich, 
f. i among hem mot be strif and plee. 
Perfore, ii Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer seith ķat we ben ofte igreued with seruantes ķat ben most nedful to vs 
and ben ful wrooth wik hem for we mote haue moche speche wik hem and comyne with hem longe tyme. 
Panne gif bytwene lordes and seruantes 
ķat ben so sogette for longe comunicacioun and speche is v greet strif, 
moche more [wolde arise greet strif] 
among citeseins of ķe whiche noon 
w o l be sogette to oķer. 
And ķerfore among hem is greet stryf 
yf ķei hadde comyn heritage; 
and if ķei most comyne moche togedres, 
ķan ķere wolde arise greet stryf. 
Pe ķridde wey is itaÞe 
by euenesse of citeseyns. For gif heritage were comyne to al ķe citeseyns, 
it were ful hard and presumptuous to gete so manye strangers 
ķat myte telie so moche lond. 
Perfore it is spedful to a citee 
to be so departed 
ķat som citeseyns goo to ķe plow 
and somme Þepe ķe citee, 
and Socrates graunteķ. 
Panne for wardeyns of ķe citee ben more noble ķan plow men, 
as more noble and worthi ķei wolde trowe ķat ķei scholde fonge more of fruyt and possessioun 
ķanne plow men, 
ķanne wolde strif arise 
among hem for plow men 
trauelen more aboute poss[ess]ioun and scholde lasse fonge of ķe fruyt. 
Panne for to taÞe heede of brotelnesse of men and gif 
it is bisiliche iknowe ķat comynte of men goon out of ķe rit wey and parfite 
for no strif scholde rise among citeseyns, 
it is spedful to a citee 
ķat posses­ sions be not comyn as Socrates seide. 
if ķe manere of staat of men is iknowe, 
ķe philosoferis wey is more spedful to a cite; 
for he seith ķat possessions and kynges | of citeseyns 
scholde be propre and comyne - col. propre touching lordschipe and comyne 
for ķe vertue of libéralité. 
For if ķe condicioun of mankynde 
is besiliche iknowe, 
as men comynlich holden lawes 
and good ordinaunce, 
it is spedful to citeseyns 
to haue propre possessions 
touchynge ķe lordschipe; 
for eche lord of his owne 
is besy aboute his owne. 
A n d it is spedful 
ķat suche thinges 
be comyne by libéralité, 
for citeseyns scholde be liberal 
among hemself 
and eue of his owne good eche to oķer. 
And ķerfore as it is iseide, 
ii Poleticorum, 
among Lacedemones 
was so greet libéralité 
ķat ķei eche hadde his owne propre good, 
good touching ķe lordschipe, 
it for libéralité touchinge ķe vse were comyne to hem seruantes, hors and houndes; 
for eche citeseyn whanne hym nedede wikoute eny oķer requisicioun vsede oķeres seruantes, hors and houndes. Chapter XII 
As it is iseid tofore, 
Socrates ordeynede ķat wymmen scholde lerne dedes of armes 
and fite in bataille 
as men doķ and took ķerto ensau[m]ple of bestes 
of ķe whiche boķe maal and femel fatten. 
But ķat kynges and princes 
and aile ķat scholde rewle a citee scholde not ordeyne wymen to dedes of armes, 
but men, 
it may be preued by ķre weyes 
by ķre ķat nedeķ 
to fite in bataille: 
for fittynge men scholde be waar and wel avised in herte, 
myti and bold of herte, 
strong and stalworthe in body. Book III Parti For cautels and wisdom ben nedful in bataille 
for som tyme enemyes 
ben ouercome more by cautels and sleythe ķan by strengte. 
For fewe sleye figttynge men 
and redy ouercomen manye not by strengte 
but | f. 
by redinesse and wisdome. 
Panne for wymmen hauen feble counsaille and lacÞen vse of resoun 
and ben not sley and waar as men ben, 
ķei scholde not be ordeyned 
to dedes of armes 
for in bataille and in fíõtyng nedeķ greet cautel and sleiķe. 
For as [V]egesius, 
De Re Militari, 
seith ķat oķere dedes ķat ben mysdo mowe be putte of but happes of batailles 
ben wikoute remedye, 
ķanne by sleyÞe 
ķat nedeķ in figtynge men 
we may argue 
ķat wymmen scholde not lerne dedes of armes. 
Pe seconde wey to preue ķe same 
is itaÞe by strengķe and boldnesse 
ķat nedeķ in fitynge men. 
For as it is iseid, 
iii Eticorum, 
ķe ende of al dredful kynges { is deķ, 
and to dedes of armes neden bolde men and hardy, 
for figtynge men putten hemself to peril of deķe, 
and comynliehe wymmen ben ferful and feble, 
and ķat is boķe for frelenesse 
of ķe body 
and for coldenesse of complexioun - 
for as it is iseid tofore coold maÞeķ alwey to fere and to drede, 
for coold constreynen and wikdrawen, 
and he ķat is bold and hardy putteķ hemself to hi doynge 
and heete maÞeķ

and coold maÞeķ 
a man fereful and coward - 
wherfore wymmen ķat ben ferful and coward scholde not be ordeyned 
to dedes of armes. 
For betere it is in bataille 
to putte awey ferful men ķanne to haue hem in companye. 
Perfore for it is kyndelich for man to drede deeķ, 
stronge men and bolde dreden 
whanne ķei seen ferful men drede. 
Panne leste fitynge men be maad cowardes and ferful, 
wymmen scholde not vse dedes of armes. 
Pe ķridde wey is itaÞe by bodiliche strengķe. 
For figtynge men mote longe sufļfre 
and eue grete stroÞes 
and bere also heuy armer, 
ķerfore coi. 
it is spedful ķat ķei haue stronge scholdres 
and lendes to bere heuy ärmere and stronge armes 
to eue stronge stroÞes. 
Panne for wymmen hauen nesch flesche and lacÞen bodilich strengķe, 
ķei scholde not be ordeyned to dedes of armes. 
A n d ķe resoun ķat meueķ Socrates so for to mené, 
ķat is itaÞe of liknesse of bestes, 
is not suffisaunt; 
for as ķe philosofer seith, 
i i Poleticorum, 
bestes vsen noon housbondrye noķer resoun; 
and by good housbondrie 
and dispensacioun men 
mote ordeyne hous and citee. 
Wherfore in thinges 
ķat bestes doun 
withoute resoun we schal not folwe hem. 
r Chapter XIII Socrates seide ķat alwey ķe same men 
scholde be princes in a cytee, 
and he spaÞe of principate 
as it is itaÞe 
for eche lordschipe 
oķer for eche maistrie oķer for eche greet office. 
A n d by ķre weyes we may preue ķat it is not spedful 
to a citee ķat ķe same men 
be alwey 
in ķe same greet office. 
Pe firste wey is itaÞe by a kyng oķer by eche oķer ķat schal eue suche office and dignyte; 
ķe seconde is itaÞe by ķe officers; 
and ķe ķridde, 
by ķe citeseyns. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For as it is iseide, 
v Ethicorum, principate scheweth what a man is, 
for a[r] men ben itaÞe to dignité 
ķei ben not so iknowe wheÞer ķei ben good or euel 
as ķei ben afterward. 
For a pryuat persone ķat haķ no maystrie 
may not be so iknowe as a comyn persone 
ķat haķ myt and maystrie. 
For not so manye iene taÞeķ hede to a priuate persone 
ķat haķ no maystrie 
as doķ 
to a comyne persone 
ķat haķ maystrie, 
a man is not so iknowe | 
while he is a priuat f. persone and haķ no maystrie 
as he is afterward iknowe 
whanne he is in office and haķ maistrie. 
Panne a kyng and eche man 
ķat schal eue an office and sette officers ķerinne scholde taÞe hede and knowe what men he maÞeķ officers. 
if principat and maystrie and eche greet office scheweth what ķat a man is, 
it is spedful ķat he [ķat] eue office and maystrie ouer citeseyns assaye first 
and knowe what men he maÞeķ officers and maystris. 
A n d after experience and assaye, 
he scholde graunte hem here office 
oķer taÞe hem to grettere office 
as it semeķ ķat it is to doynge. 
Pe seconde wey to preue ķe same 
is itaÞe by officers. 
For officers of citées wolde do moche harme gif ķei knewe ķat ķei were perpetual in here office, 
and wolde spare to do suche harme gif ķei knewe ķat ķei scholde out of office. 
Pe ķridde wey is itaÞe by citeseyns 
ķat ben vnder suche officers. 
For as a leche taÞeķ no counsaille of heele 
but hele is his entent as ķe ende, 
so he ķat ordeynek 
a cite schal 
not axe counsaille of pees 
and of acord of citeseyns. 
For as it is iseid, 
ii[/] Ethicorum, 
counsaille i[s] not of ķe ende 
but of menés to come to ķe ende, 
and pees and acord scholde be ķ'entent 
of ķe reulere of a citee as ķe ende. 
Panne a citee scholde be soo desposed ķat pees may be Þepte ķerinne 
and no tresoun arise ķerinne. 
And som tyme chaungynge of officers and euyng of maystrees and principates 
to diuerse persones helpen to maÞe ķe staat of cite­ seyns 
in pees and quiete 
as ķe philosofer meneķ, ii Poleticorum. 
For if oķere were forsaÞe and alwey ķe same men [were isette] 
in greet office, oķer, seynge hemself | despised, 
wolde conspire and rise and disturble col. ķe citee. 
Secundo Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer toucheķ ķis ķridde resoun ķat dispreuen ķe ordinaunce of Socrates. For he seith ķat Socrates wolde alwey haue ķe same princes and officers, 
and ķat is cause of rysyng 
and of tresoun among hem ķat hauen no dignité. 
For seyng ķat ķei haue non dignité, 
gif ķei ben bold and hardi, 
ķei drawen togedres 
and risen and maÞen greet discord and strif. Book III Parti Chapter XIV 
For we trowen ķat philosofres 
tretynge of policies 
and of ordenance of citeseyns 
speÞe not wikoute resoun, 
ķerfore it is wel idoo to trete here 
opynyons not for boost 
but for it is nedful to ķe lore 
and wey ķat we schal teche of rewelyng of citee and of regne. 
A n d for it is iknowe what philosofer wolde mené 
in ķat mater and gif here 
opynyons ben itreted, 
it wolde be ķe more clerliche iknowe 
what is best menyng 
in suche matier of rewelynge. 
Panne for it is declared 
tofore ķat it 
is not spedful 
to a cite ķat possessions, 
wyues and children be comyne, 
as Socrates wolde mené, 
noķer it is semelich ķat wymmen be ordeyned 
to dedes of armes, 
noķer it is good 
ķat alwey ķe same officers 
be in ķe same office 
as Socrates ordeyned, 
ķanne it is to tretyng of deuysioun and delynge ķat Socrates ordeynede of a cite and of ordenaunce ķerof. 
For Socrates seide as it is iseide 
tofore ķat in a citee scholde be fyue parties - prince, counsaillers, fightyng men, craftes men and plow men - 
for he wolde ķat figttynge men 
scholde be a partye of ķe citee distynguede 
fro oķere citeseyns. 
And he ordeinede nombre and tale of fitynge men 
and seide ķat in 
eche citee scholde be fif ķousant at ķe most, 
a mille at ķe leste. 
And | ķis ordenance of fyghtyng men 
may be f. i despreued in ķre manere wise by ķre manere doynge ķat Socrates seide of fightynge men. 
For firste he seide ķat a scholde be distingwed fram oķere citeseins; 
ķe seconde, 
he ordeynede a greet multitude of figtynge men; 
ķe ķridde, 
he ordeyned hem 
in a certeyne nombre and tale. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wyse. 
For alwey comyne profit scholde be sette to[fore] a singuler profit, 
and it is kyndelich 
ķat a partie put itself to peril for aile ķe body, 
ķanne agenst ķe ordre of kynde eche citeseyn doķ gif he putte not hymself 
to peril for ķe defence of ķe contreye. 
Panne fitynge men scholde not so alwey be departed so fro Cristene men and oķere citeseyns 
so ķat oķere citeseyns 
neden not to figtee for ķe contreye. 
Panne it is bettre to seye 
ķat in a citee ben 
as manye fightynge men 
and defendours of ķe contreye 
as ķerinne ben citeseyns 
ķat may bere ärmere. 
A n d so it is bettere 
ķan departe fight­ ynge fram oķere citeseyns. 
Pe seconde wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For [to] ordeyne so manye fitynge men 
as in eche citee fyue ķousand 
or a ķousand, 
it were ful hard and greet charge to ķe citeseyns of oon citee to susteyne by comyne wages 
a ķousand men 
of ķe whiche non haķ office 
noķer can do but fite whan it is tyme. 
A n d it were more charge 
and as it were more ķan citeseyns myte bere to susteyne 
fyue ķousand in ķat wise, 
for ķat citee most haue possessions 
as it were at wille ķat it myte 
by comyn cost susteyne so many men. 
Perfore, ii Poleticorum, 
ķe philoso­ fer blameķ Socrates | 
for suche ordinaunce of cite and seith ķat ķe citee col. r so iordeyned moste be 
in ķe regne of Babilonia, 
on caas for greet desert and wildernesse ķer is pase of londes 
ķat myte fede manye men. 
For as ķe philosofer meneķ, 
it were more hard to citeseyns 
to fede hemself, seruantes, and children 
and so manye fittyng men ouer. 
Pe ķridde, Socrates trespacede ordeynynge a cite and settynge certeyn nombre 
and tale of fitynge men; 
for as ķe philosofer seith, 
ii Polet­ icorum, 
he ķat w o l sette lawes 
oķer maÞe eny ordenaunce 
in a cite scholde taÞe hede to ķre: 
to ķe men, 
to ķe contreye, 
and to place ķat ben ny aboute. 
Panne gif a man wolle ordeyne fytynge men oķere ķanne citeseyns leuynge by comune fruyt of ķe citee, 
he scholde taÞe hede to ķre. Firste, 
to ķe citeseyns; 
for if ķe citeseyns were cowardes not able tofite, 
ķanne nedede moo fitynge men of suche. 
Pe seconde, 
he scholde taÞe hede 
to ķe contray and londes; 
[for ķe moo contray and londes] 
a citee haķ, 
ķe moo fitynge men ķa[t] he may susteyne. 
Pe ķridde, 
he scholde taÞe hede to place 
ķat ben ny aboute wheÞer ķat cite haue ny aboute frendes oķer enemyes, cowardes oķer manlich men; 
for by diuerse condicions of som men 
it nedeķ to ordeyne diuerseliche of ķe nombre of fityng men. 
Panne for art and science 
may not be of particuler thinges asigned, 
he ķat w o l teche art of rewelyng of citées 
may not ordeyne certeyn nombre of fitynge men; 
but suche doynges moot stonde on ķe doom of a wise rector 
and rewelere takynge heede 
of condicions of citeseyns, 
of manere of ķe contrey, 
and circumstance | of men 
ķat ben ny aboute. Chapter XV 
It was iseide tofore ķat Socrates 
and his disciple Plato seide ķat a citee scholde be so ireweled and gouerned 
ķat citeseyns scholde haue comyne wifes, children and possessiouns. 
And ķat may not stonde 
if it is vnderstonde 
as ķe wordis stondeķ 
as it is declared tofore. 
Nathalees for Plato and his disciples 
ķat were icleped Platonici 
and hadde a manere spekynge by liknesse, 
and oon caas Socrates vsede 
ķat manere spekynge 
while Plato was his disciple, 
gif we wollen vnderstonde Socrates speche not 
as ķe wordes soneķ, 
we may saue [h]is ļposicioun. 
For it is not possible 
noķer profitable 
ķat alle kynges 
be verreyliche comyn to citeseyns, 
but by loue comynte scholde be saued ķerinne. 
For as eche citeseyn scholde loue oķer citeseyns as hymself, 
so Þey scholde loue here wyues, children and possessioun as his owne. 
Panne in ķis wise alle thinges 
scholde be comyne to citeseyns 
so ķat eche scholde loue ķe comyne profit and ķe profit of alle and be besy for possessions of oķere citeseyns 
whanne it is tyme 
as ķei it were his owne. 
In wyues and children comynte schal be saued and Þepte by loue 
but in possessions comynte scholde be Þepte not onlich by loue so ķat al citeseyns scholde loue comynliche ķe profit of eche citeseyn, 
f. i v Book III Parti 
but also by perteynynge and by libéralité. 
For eche citeseyn scholde departe and loue eue of good 
to oķere citeseyns 
as resoun axek. 
Panne as we sauen Socrates 
speche toching comyntees of citeseyns, 
so we may saue his speche touchinge vnite of a cite. 
For whanne he seide ķat most vnite scholde be in a citee, 
| on caas he vnderstood not col. 
of vnite of habitacioun and wonynge place 
so ķat alle citeseyns 
scholde wonye in oon hous, 
so ķat in a citee scholde not be % manye hous 
noķer manye stretes; 
noķer of vnite of craftes men, 
so ķat in a citee scholde 
not by diuerse craftes and diuerse craftes men; 
noķer of vnyte of kynges 
ķat neden to suffisant leuynge, 
so ķat in a citee scholde 
not be manye and diuerse kynges 
ķat nedeķ to ķe lyf. 
But on caas ķei menede of vnyte of loue and frendschipe 
so ķat a citee 
were best gif citeseyns 
were most oned and acorded in loue and frendschipe. 
Panne for Socrates menynge 
is declared of comynte of thinges 
and of vnyte of citeseyns, 
it is soķ ķat he trowede ķat in a cite scholde be most pees 
and ķat no stryf scholde rise ķerinne, 
for propre desire of loue semeķ pees and acoo[r]d. 
And ķat Socrates seide ķat wymmen 
scholde be ordeyned 
to dedes of armes 
it may be saued; 
for gif men were out of ķe citee figtyng 
in ķe feeld and enemyes fui 
on ķe citee 
in ķe mené tyme, 
ķanne for defaute of men 
wymen most defende ķe citee. 
A n d ķat he seith ķat alwey ķe same officers 
scholde be in office 
so ķat alwey ķe same scholde be meyre, bayllees and officers, 
on caas it scholde be so vnderstonde so ķat alwey ķe same manere vertues men scholde be in gret office. 
And for he deuydede and delede ķe cite in craftes men, 
plow men and fitynge men, 
he vnderstood by fiötynge men gentel men and noble ķat scholde not worche 
with here hondes. 
In a citee som men worchen wik I here hondes % 
as plow men and craftes men; 
and somme worch- f. cipaliche defende ķe contre and principaliche vse sleyÞe of armes. 
For Socrates wolde mené ķat no polici 
and comynte scholde be cleped a citee but ķerinne were atte leste a ķousand gentil men and noble, 
and he clepede hem figtynge men 
by manere excellent doynge. Chapter XVI 
Alle wikoute Socrates and Plato oon oķer ķat heet Felleas 
as ķe philosofer telleķ, 
ii Poleticorum, 
entermete of ordenaunce of citées and ordeyned 
how policy myt best be iordeyned, 
and seide ķat among oķere 
ķat ķe euere of ķe lawe and rector of polecie scholde knowe O o n is how citeseyns scholde haue ileche moche possessioun; 
for he wolde mené ķat a cite is best iordeyned 
if no citesen hath more rente noķer possessioun ķanne anoķer, and seith ķat it myt be esiliche idoo 
in ķe bygynnynge whanne a citee is imaad. 
For gif ķe nombre of citeseyns is iknow 
and ķe multitude of feldes acounted sone, 
ķe rector of ķe citee 
may dele ķe possessions euene among ķe citeseyns. 
But whanne ķe cite is imaad 
and citeseyns hauen possessions not al ileche moche, 
it is hard for to bryng hem to haue al ileche moche. 
But Felleas ordeyned ķat ķe rector 
of a citee schulde brynge hem ķerto in ķis wise 
by dowynge and ordeynede ķat ķe pore scholde be wedded to ķe riche and fonge dowynge of riche in contracte and eue noon to ķe riche. 
Panne ķe | pore fongyng greet dowyng of ķe riche coi. 
may be as riche as he. 
A n d Felleas myte by ķre resons be meued to suche ordeynyng: 
first, he myte be meued ķerto for strif scholde ceese; 
ķe seconde, 
for to putte of wrong and discord; 
ķe ķridde, 
by kynges ķat he sey in oķere polices. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For citeseyns stryuen faste for possessions and coueyten comynliche to moche to haue rente and possessioun and ķerof comeķ gret strif, 
wherfore, if citeseyns hadde alle ileche moche possessioun 
and knewe ķat no citeseyn 
myte passe oķer in possessioun, 
it were an idel for to strive 
and plede ķerfore. 
For if oon ķat pledeķ reÞeuereķ of ķe oķer, 
he schal not Þerby 
taÞe greet profit; 
for by ķe condicioun of doynge 
he mot be euene wiķ oķere citeseyns in possessioun. 
Also he ķat leseķ ķe plee schal not moche lese, 
for fongynge dowynge 
he schal be maad peere wiķ ķe oķere in richesse. 
Panne it semeķ ķat al strif 
and plee scholde ceese gif citeseyns 
were alle ileche riche. 
Pe seconde wey is itaÞe to putte of wrong 
and discord in ķe citee. 
For by cause ķat citeseyns 
wolde gladliche haue propre possessions 
and saye "ķis is 
myne," not oonliche stryf and plee ariseķ 
but also wronges, 
discord and dispisynge 
for to gete possessions, 
for ķerfore citeseyns 
don eche oķer wrong and despisen persones. 
Also in a citee is ķefte, 
robberie and manslaut 
for coueytise of possessioun; 
and [ p a n n e $ i f citeseyns 
m a y n o t passe hem i n possessions, 
and h a u e t h ileche moche r i c h e s ] it semeķ ķat al ķis scholde ceese. 
Pe ķridde wey is itaÞe by thinges 
ķat ķei | seie in oķere citeseyns. 
f. 
For in manye policies 
wel iordeyned euers of ķe lawe hadde greet charge of possessions of citeseyns, 
on caas ķerfore Felleas 
was imeued by thinges 
ķat he seie in oķere policées, 
ķat is wisdomes, 
and ordeyned to haue greet charge of possessions of citeseyns, 
willyng ķat pos­ sessions scholde bee euene 
and alle citeseyns haue ileche moche possession. 
V Chapter XVII [if ķe] speche of ķe philosofer, 
ii Poleticorum, % is iknowe touching ķis doyng, 
by ķre weyes we may preue ķat it nedeķ not ķat citeseyns haue 
alle ileche moche possessioun 
as Felles ordeyned. 
Pe firste is Book III 
Parti itaÞe 
by gendryng of children; 
ķe seconde, 
by wrong ķat myte aryse in ķe citee; 
ķe ķridde, 
by vertues ķat citeseyns scholde haue. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For to rigtful rewelyng of a cite 
may no lawe be eue 
ķat citeseyns scholde haue alle ileche moche possessioun 
but it were iordeyned 
ķat ķei scholde haue alle ileche manye children; 
for it is folie to eue a lawe ķat may not be holde. 
For, iiii Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer seith ķat 
it is not onliche to chargynge 
what lawes ben yeue 
but also ķat men ben obedient to ķe lawes. 
Panne gif alle citeseyns hauen alle ileche moche possessions 
and oon haķ moo children ķan anoķer, 
whanne ķe fader heritage 
is ideled among children 
ķanne failleķ Felleas <is> lawe for not alle citeseyns 
hauen ileche moche possessioun. 
Panne for in ķe moo parties 
a kyng is departed 
ķe lasse is eche paitiners deel ķerof, 
it may not be ķat alwey citeseyns haue ileche moche possessioun 
but eche citeseyn haue as manye children as anoķer. 
But for som mariage 
is al 
barey|ne and som col. 
hath mo children ķanne anoķer, 
it is not poscible to ordeyne 
in a citee ķat alle citeseyns haue ileche manye children. 
Wherfore by gendryng of children 
it is clerliche declared 
ķat ķe forseyde lawe 
is not skilful, 
for it may not be skilliche iholde. 
Pe seconde wey is itaÞe by wronges 
ķat myte arise 
in ķe citee of ķe whiche wronges 
he ķat eueķ ķe lawe scholde be most besiliche waar. 
For it longeķ to ķe prince 
to haue charge ķat citeseynes be not mysfarynge 
and ķat noon do oķer wrong. 
But gif it is iordeyned 
in a citee ķat ķe pore be euene wik riche men 
in possessioun fongynge gret doynge of hem 
and euynge to hem rigt noon, 
it happeķ ofte ķat riche men 
ben imaad poore and pore men riche. 
For if sum riche men 
haue [mo] children ķanne pore men, 
here possessions mot be deled 
in mo partees ķanne possessions of pore men. 
A n d so riche men children 
schal be more pore ķanne pore men children, 
and herof comeķ wrong 
in ķe citee in twey manere wise. First, 
for pore men cunne not bere fortune 
whanne ķei ben riche 
as ķe philosofer declareth playnliche, 
ii Rethorycorum, 
ķanne he wolle do oķere men wrong. 
For pore men children ben proute whanne ķei ben more riche 
ķan oķere and don oķere wrong, 
and so wrong riseķ in ķe citee. 
Also suche wrong and despisynge scholde rise among citeseyns 
not onliche 
by pore mennes children 
but also | by reche men children. 
For as it is iseid, 
i i Polet- f. icorum, 
it is nedful to pees of a citee ķat riche men children 
be not mysfarynge and outrages. 
Panne for comynliche riche men children 
louen worschep 
and ben greet herted, 
if ķei seen hemself dispised and pore men iworscheped, 
ķei mowe not forbere 
but be mysfarynge and outrages 
and do oķer men wrong. 
Pe ķridde wey to declare ķat Felleas his lawe of euene possessioun 
is not skilful 
it is itaÞe 
by vertues ķat citeseyns schuld haue, 
for citeseyns schulde be liberal and temporat. 
Pan it is not wel iseid 
that to r ķe rewling of a cite 
it is inow ķat citeseyns haue euene possessions 
but ķe quantité of possessions were in som wise isette in certeyne. 
For citeseyns myt haue so litel possessioun 
ķat ķei most lyue so scarseliche ķat ķei mite not wel do dedes of libéralité. 
Also if possessions were euene ideled among citeseyns, 
ķei myte haue so moche possessioun and lyue so likyngliche ķat ķei scholde be not temperate. Chapter XVIII Kynges and princes and aile ķat schuld yue lawe schuld eue som lawe of som possessions of citeseyns. 
For Salmon ķat was iholde wis and redi 
in euyng of lawe 
af manye lawes of possessions of citeseyns. 
Also among ķe men ķat ben icleped Locres 
as ķe philosofer seith, ii Poleticorum, 
it was ķe lawe ķat for to Þepe 
and saue ķe olde stokÞes of heritage 
al hool no man scholde selle possessions 
but he myte preue 
atte folle ķat som gret myshappe hym were byfalle. 
And manye thinges ben iordeyned in lawe of possessions, 
but it is not spedful to ordeyne 
by lawe ķat citeseyns mite | haue al ileche col. moche possession. 
And his entent ķat eueķ ķe lawe schulde not principalich be of possession, 
but his entent schulde principalliche be to abate coueitise - 
for outward possessions 
is not ķe rote of malice 
but coueitise is ķe rote of euel and malice. 
Pan gif ķei schulde recche and charge ķe rote and cause more ķan oķere kynges, rectoris of citeseyns schul charge more to abate coueitise ķa[n] oķer kynges 
as ķe philosofer preueķ, 
ii Poleticorum. 
But here of we schul speÞe more largeliche herafter. 
But we ben avised ķat we made a tretes of diuersete of ethic, rethorik, and of politik. 
And thinges ķat ben iseid 
ķer semen 
atte firste sit contrarie to thinges 
ķat we hauen now iseid, 
but inneremore ķat contrariete schal be put of. 
And now it is inow 
to knowe ķat his princi­ pal entent ķat eueķ lawe scholde not be on mesure of outward possessioun, 
and ķat we may preue by ķre weyes: 
ķe firste is itaÞe by werschep ķat men disiren, 
ķe seconde by likynge ķat men folwen, 
ķe ķridde by sorwe 
ķat men schonyen and forsaÞen. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wyse. 
For Felleas trowede ķat al stryf of a citee 
is for possessioun and lordschipe of outward thinges. 
But he was deceyued in suche trowyng; 
for ķei pore men 
for ķei hauen grete nede to outward good 
stryuen comynliche 
and pleden for out­ ward good, nathalees worschepful persones and gracious 
ben more destourbled and hauen more indignacioun 
yf ķei mow not haue Þewe werschep 
as ķei ben worthi. 
Panne for somme citeseyns ben pore persones 
and somme ben worschepful and gracious, 
ķe euere of lawes 
scholde not onliche ordeyne 
ķat possessiouns be | wel iordeyned f. 
but also ķat worschep be semelich and ritfullyche ideled. 
A n d ķe v Book III 
Parti more principaliche ķei scholde taÞe heede 
ķat wirschepe be rigtfulliche ideled 
in so moche as strif and plee 
bytwene worschepful persones 
is worse and more perelous ķanne 
bytweyn oķere persones. Pe seconde wey to preue ķe same is itaÞe by likynge 
ķat men folwen comynliche. 
For not onliche men don wronge

but also ķei doun wrong 
in dougtres and wyues of citeseyns 
for likyng and intemporatnesse. 
Panne kynges and prynces 
scholde not maÞe lawe oonliche 
for mesure of possessioun 
so ķat eche man haue his owne, 
but he scholde also maÞe manye ordenaunces 
to abate passions 
so ķat citeseyns 
be not intemporate noķer do wrong 
in wyues and doutres of oķere men. 
A n d ķe more luf wyues and doutres ben passynge oķer outward good, 
ķe more besy kynges and princes scholde be in ķat doynge. 
Pe ķridde wey is itaÞe by sorwe

For men wolde haue ioye and likynge withoute sorwe 
and don ķerfore wrong to oķere men 
not onlich to haue kynges 
ķat nedeķ to putte of hunger oķer cold, 
but also for he trowek 
ķat oķere men may lette here likynge oķer for he troweth ķat oķere men may do hem sorwe. 
Panne not onliche for possessions lawe scholde be maad as Felleas seide 
but also for oķere doynge as it is declared tofore atte folle. | col. Chapter XIX 
Alle wikoute Socrates and Felleas 
was anoķer philosofer 
ķat heet Ipodomus 
ķat entremetede of rewelyng of citées 
and made many ordenaunces perteynyng to rewelyng of citeseyns. 
And it semeķ ķat his ordinaunce 
touching suche rewelyng 
ben conteyned in sexe. 
For first, he made manye ordenaunces perteynynge 
to multitude and distinccioun of citeseyns; 
ķe seconde, 
he termyned of distinciouns of possessions; 
ķe ķridde, 
of distinccions of auditours; 
ķe ferķe, 
of distincciouns of iuges; 
ķe fifķe, 
of ķe manere of demyng; 
ķe sexte and laste, 
he made certeyne lawes touchinge diuerse persones. 
A n d Ipodomus makyng his polici, 
a j entermeted first of multitude 
and distinccioun of citeseyns, 
and seide ķat ķe best multitude 
and quantité of citeseyns 
is as it were ķe nombre of x ķousand men. 
A n d he distingwed ķis multitude 
in ķre partees - 
in figtynge men, craftes men, 
and lond tyliers. 
And he wolde ķat fitynge men 
scholde haue ärmere and no lond, 
and erķe tilers scholde haue lond and non armer, 
and craftes men no lond noķer armer. 
As it longeķ to ķis doyng, 
it semeķ ķat man nedeķ ķre: mete and drynÞe for kynde hete ķat wastek ķe moysture ķat hatte humidum radicale. 
Pe seconde, man nedeķ clothyng and oķere thinges 
imaad by craft for distemperyng of ķe ayere. 
Pe ķridde, man nedeķ defence for strange enemyes 
and for strif and discord 
ķat may falle in ķe cite. 
A n d to ķes ķre seruen ķe ķre forseyde maners of men. 
Touchinge mete and drynÞe, 
lond tilers suffisen so ķat we vn|derstonde 
by lond tiliers 
f. s al ķat tilien lond and vyneõerdes 
and alie herdes ķat Þepen bestes. 
But touchinge hous and clothynge and oķere crafty thinges craftes men suffisen. 
A n d figtynge men serueķ for ķe defence. 
Panne ķe forseyde philosofer ordeyned in ķis wise of multitude of citeseyns. 
Pe seconde, 
he entermetede hym and tretede of distinccioun of possessions and delede al ķe contraye in aile ķe demaynes of ķe citee 
in ķre parties - 
ķe holy partie, comyn, and propre - 
and asynned ķe holy parti 
to seruice of God, 
ķe comyn partie to fiõttyng men, 
and ķe propre partie to lond tileers. 
A n d he seide 
that demaynes ben best ideled gif 
a partie is assigned to hem ķat seruen G o d in temples, 
and he cleped ķat partie ķe holy partie. 
A n d ķe partie ķat is assigned for fightynge men 
is icleped ķe comyn partye, 
for fiõtynge men scholde haue in ķe comyn cost 
for defence of ķe contrey. 
And ķe partie of lond tylers 
was icleped ķe propre partie. 
A n d to craftes men 
was no partie assigned for hem, 
for ķei myte lyue by here craft. 
Also figttynge men hauen no demayne 
as it were here owne 
but me eaf hem ärmere; 
but he seide ķat he schulde be som comyne demayne certayne and ķerof fightynge men scholde haue here leuynge 
as it were of comyn tresorie. 
Pe ķridde, 
he entermetede hym of distynccioun of domes and seide ķat comyne domes 
scholde be of ķre 
as citeseyns pietek of ķre: 
of greef, of wrong, and of deķ. 
For eche ķat misdooķ 
anoķer greueķ his thinges 
and harmeķ ķe persone, 
and ķat in twey manere wise - 
oķer doyng hym schäme 
and despite oķer greuynge hym | wik stroÞes and col. wondes. 
A n d mysdoynge touchinge kynges 
he clepede nocumentum, 
greef oķer noye; 
and mysdoynge touchynge schame 
and despite he clepeķ iniuria, wrong; 
and mysdoynge wik stroÞes and wondes 
he clepede deeķ, 
for % [suche ben iordeynede to] deķ, 
for eche strong passioun 
appayrek ķe substaunce. 
Pe ferķe, 
he entermetede [hym] of % distinccioun of iuges 
and seide ķat ķer scholde be twey manere of iuges 
and twey elde halles - 
oon ordenarie and comyne 
in ķe whiche causes scholde be treted and ipleted, 
and anoķer principal to ķe whiche peles scholde be brout, 
as ķe philosofer telleķ. 
He wolde ķat in ķe principālie elde halle scholde be twey wyse men 
of lawe ichose of olde men 
so ķat if eny euel doom were igeue in ķe comyn elde halle, 
ķilÞe chosen olde men of good fame scholde do rit. 
Pe fifte, 
he entermetede of manere of demyng 
and wolde ķat in eiķer gelde halle, 
boķe in ķe principal 
and in ķe comyne, 
doom scholde be eue withoute consaillynge of iuges 
and tretyng bytwene hemself. 
For whanne ķe cause were iherd, 
eche iuge by hymself schulde avise hym 
and afterward scholde write ķe sentence in a scrowe. 
A n d gif Book III 
Parti he ķat is accused 
is condempned atte fülle, 
ķe iuge schal write a symple condempnacioun; 
and gif it is iquytte, 
he schal bere a voide scrowe. 
But gif he is som del condempned 
and som dele aquyte, 
ķe iuge schal declare ķat by writyng. 
A n d , ii Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer telleķ ķe pos[ic]ioun of ķe forseide philosofer 
and telleķ cause 
w h i Ypodomus made suche ordinaunce. 
For he trowede | ķat gif ķe iuges were com- f. 
i pellede to telle here avise, 
on caas he wolde be foriswore 
and drede to telle here 
a vice tofore oķere men. 
Perfore he ordeynede ķat eche scholde preueylich write his owne sentence. 
Pe sixte, he made certeyn lawes touchynge diuerse manere persones 
and made foure suche lawes. 
Pe firste ķerof touchede wise men; 
ķe seconde, figtynge men; 
ķe ķridde, al ķe puple; 
ķe firķe, ķe prince. 
Touchinge wise men [he] iordeyned ķat eche man 
ķat fond vp and deuysed eny thing spedful to ķe citee scholde ķerfore haue Þewe worschip. 
A n d touchinge figtynge men 
he ordeynede ķat here children 
ķat were dede in bataille for defence of ķe contrey and of ķe citee scholde fonge of ķe comune tresori. 
Pe ķridde, 
touching al ķe puple he ordeynek ķat al ķe puple, figtyng men and craftes and lond tiliers, 
schuld come ifere to choise and eleccioun of ķe prince. 
For as it semeth 
by his speche ķat he wolde not ķat ķe prince scholde be prince by heritage 
but by chois and eleccioun; 
and he assignede ķat eleccioun 
to al ķe puple. 
Pe ferķe, touchinge ķe prince ichose he ordeyned ķat ķe prince schulde haue principal charge of ķre: 
[of] comyn good, of pilgrimes, 
and of orphanes. 
A n d he clepede orphanes generalliche alle persones 
vnmygty ķat mygte not by hemself meynteyne here owne rigt. 
For it longeķ to a kyng 
and to a prince ķat scholde be Þepere of rigt to haue special charge 
of ķe comyn profit 
and of pilgrymes 
and of vnmygty persones, 
for oķere wolle soné do soche persones wrong 
for ķei mowe not defende his owne rigt. | col. Chapter XX 
Moche good we hauen of oppynyons 
of olde philosofres 
for in here 
speche ķei seide manye soth sawes. 
And ķeig ķei hadde seide not soth it here 
opynyons scholde be rehersed; 
and, ii Methaphisice, 
ķe philosof er seith ķat we schulde ķonÞe hem ķat sparen ķe sothe and discorden 
fro oure oppinyons, 
for som tyme suche doynges reķeķ oure witte. 
For ofte euel speche of som men exciten and areren ķe witte of oķer men 
to deme rigtfulliche. 
Panne we rehersen ķe opynyoun of Ypodomus, 
for in his polecye he seide manye goode sentences 
and ordeynede wel many thinges. 
But as it longeķ to ķis doynge, 
folwynge of ķe philoso­ fer, 
ii Poleticorum, 
we may blame Ypodomus for ķre: first, 
for he made v contrarie ordenance; 
)pe seconde, 
for Ipe manere 
fcat he ordeyned in demynge; 
ķ>e ķridde, 
for lawes ķ>at he made touchynge diuerse manere of persones. 
Andfirste, 
ķ>e forseide philosofer failedemakynge contrarie ordinance and statutes, 
for Ipe Staat of Ipe distinccioun of citeseyns 
may not stonde wi\> ķ>e statute of choys 
and eleccioun of Ipe prince. 
For if a citee scholde be distyngwed in JDre parties 
as he seith in fightynge men, 
[ c r a f t e s m e n , 
and l o n d t i l i e r s , 
and o n l i c h e fi&ynge men hauen armure] ļ}at myte allegge and abate strif and discord 
in Ipe citee and defende ķ>e contrey fro enemyes, 
ķanne Ipe fiõtynge moste be more myõty Ipan Ipe lond tiliers and craftes men ifere; 
for alwey Ipe more myõty men hauen Ipe maystrie and ben lordes and men doun gladliche wrong 
whanne Ipei mowe. 
Pan if it were so, craftes men and lond tiliers scholde haue no part in policie wise materes and ordenaunce of Ipe citee; 
and also Ipe fitynge men wolde not | 
suffre hem to haue voce in f. i Ipe elección of Ipe prince. 
Panne Ipe statute ķat seith ķat alle Ipe puple schulde chese Ipe prince 
may not stonde with Ipe statute of fightynge men for Ipei ben more myty ķanne alle Ipe o\>ere and oonliche Ipei hauen armure. 
Pe seconde, Ypodomus faillede in Ipe manere 
fcat he ordeyned in demyng, 
for he wolde ļsat iuges 
scholde not treete togeders 
in Þe gelde halle of Ipe sentences 
Þat scholde be eue. 
But as Ipe philosofer seith, 
he demede not Þat Ipey myte 
trete preueyliche at home. 
A n d ķ>is may be despreued 
by twey weyes. First, 
for of Þis manere demynge cornel} 
more wronge and also lasse worschep to Þe iuges, 
for iuges doun rather amys 
if pei mowen speke togedres priuelich kan to speke togederes oponlich in Ipe eld halle; 
and if pei mowe not telle eche oļ^er his avis, 
ķ>ei scholde sonnere do amys in pis manere ļ^an in ano^er wise. 
A n d so Ipe philosofer meneķ> ķat in al good 
p[ole]cies ķat bien good is iordeyned Ipe contrarie of Ypodomus his ordenaunce 
where it is iordeyned 
f>at iuges mowe speke togeders 
opunlich ķat Ipei mowe not haue counsaille 
in a preuey place. 
Also Ipe forseide manere faille^ for in som domes 
it nedep Þat iuges trete and haue colacioun togeders 
as if Ipe iuges discorden, 
it nedeķ ķat Ipei haue collacioun togeders 
and trete whos sentence is best. Pe ķridde, 
Ipe forsayde philosofer faillede in lawes 
ķat he made touchinge diuerse manere persones, 
and namliche in lawes 
fcat he made touchinge [wi]s men. 
For gif eche wise man 
ķat fyndejD eny thing 
pat is spedful schulde haue pewe worschep, 
fcanne wise men | wolde col. 
fonde to fynde newe lawes 
and to declare 
ķ>at newe lawes ben good and profitable to Ipe cite. 
[Panne gif in Ipe cite lawes scholde chaunge alwey, 
£>at is perilous to pe 
cite,] 
for lawes hauen greet effecte of longe durynge of tyme; 
wherfore gif lawes 
were al alwey inewed, pei scholde lese here vertue and effecte. 
Panne Ypodomus his statute of hym pat r Book III 
Parti fyndek t ķat is spedful 
to a citee semeķ good atte first sit, 
but it is perelous 
as ķe philosofer seith. 
Panne in ķes Ypodomus failleķ.

and oķere thinges ķat mowe bee axede in ķis matere

But it is inow

for by cause of many causes,

Incipit par[s] secundta] Egidii Qibtri] tercii. I Chapter I After ķat by help of G 
o d we hauen imaad ende of ķe firste partie of ķis ķridde book 
and rehersed certeyn preambules and nedful menés 
to ķe purpos 
and rehersed diuerse opynyons of ķe philosofer 
ķat ordeynede policies and taugte art of rewelyng of citee and of regne, 
now it is to tretyng of ķe oķere twey parties of rewelyng of cite and of regne 
in tyme of pees 
and of suche rewelyng 
in tyme of werre. 
Panne it is to wetynge ķat 
as in a tyme of werre 
a cite scholde be defended by ärmere, 
so in tyme of pees ķei scholde be reweled by rigtful lawes and vsages 
ķat ben apreued and hauen strengķe of lawe. 
Panne it semeķ ķat ärmere 
in tyme of werre 
is ilikned to lawes 
in tyme of pees. 
For it is iknowe ķat in tyme of [pees] cite 
and regne scholde be reweled 
by rigtful lawes 
and vsages apreued, 
it may be sone iknowe how many thinges 
moste be iknowe 
in suche rewelyng. 
[And it semeķ, iii Poleticorum, 
ķe philosopher toucheķ foure ķat moste be knowe in rewelyng] of cite; 
and ķes ben ķe prince, 
ķe counsaile, ķe gelde halle, and ķe puple. 
A n d by selue lawes 
by ķe whiche a citee | scholde be col. 
reweled in tyme of pees 
we may preue by twey weyes 
ķat ķes foure 
moste be knowe 
in rewelyng of citee 
in tyme of pees. 
Pe first wey is itaÞe 
by thinges 
ķat nedeķ to lawe; 
ķe seconde, 
by ķe ende wherfore ķe lawe is imaad. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For as it longeķ to ķis doynge, 
for to haue ritful rewelynge 
by lawe nedeķ foure. 
First, 
ķat ķe lawes be wel imaad by wit and wisdome. Pe seconde, ķat ķei be wel iÞepte 
by cyuel myt and powere. 
Pe ķridde, 
ķat dedes of citeseyns 
be ritfulliche 
ydemed by lawes ymaad and iÞepte. 
Pe ferķe and ķe laste, 
ķat ordenaunce ķat is conteyned in lawes 
ben wel iÞepte 
for pesible Staat of Þe puple. 
A n d good Þepynge of lawes longeķ t o Þ e prince; 
ķerfore, v Ethicorum, 
ķe philosofer seith ķat ķe prince 
scholde be Þepere of rigt. 
Pat is to menynge of riõtful lawes and statutes, 
for laweful statutes 
mowe be cleped certein lawes. 
A n d good makynge of lawes 
by witte and wisdome longeķ to ķe counsaille; 
for princes scholde haue so wise consaillours 
ķat ķei myte fynde and maÞe ordenance 
ķat ķe puple scholde Þeweliche Þepe. 
A n d good demyng by lawes 
ķat ben imaad by consaillours 
and iÞepte by ķe prince 
it longeth to Þe eld halle 
and to Þe iuges, 
and ķe puple schal deme dedes 
of ķe citeseyns 
by suche lawes. 
A n d alle citeseins 
and aile Þe puple scholde Þepe 
and holde ķe lawes. 
Wherfore if kynges ben iknowe ķat nedeķ to Þat a citee is wel irewled in tyme of pees in suche rewelynge, 
it nedeķ to maÞe mencioun 
of ķe forsaide foure. 
Pe seconde wey to | preue ķe same is itaÞe by Þe ende wherfore f. lawes ben imaad; 
for his entent ķat maÞen lawes scholde be for we schulde haue kyng ķat is good and profitable 
and voide noy and greef, 
and do rit and voide vnrit, 
and gete kyng ķat 
is to preysynge 
and leue kyng ķat is to blamyng. 
Of good doynge 
and of greuous doyng is counsaille; 
of rigt and vnrit is ķe eld halle and doom; 
but of kyng Þat is to blamynge and preysynge is commaundyng and forbedyng 
ķat may longe to al Þe puple. 
For namelich by lawes ķe puple 
scholde be brout in to do wel, 
for in lawes 
what is to preysynge is commaunded 
and what is to blamynge is forbode. 
Panne he ķat wolde termyne 
how a citee scholde be rewled 
in tyme of pees 
mot knowe not onliche 
what manere man scholde be prince 
ķat scholde eue and Þepe lawes, 
but also what manere men scholde be counsaillours 
ķat schulde knowe 
what is profitable 
and what is greuous, 
and what maner men schulde be iugis of lond ķat schuld deme what is rigt 
and what is wrong, 
and what maner men ķe pupil schulde be. 
Pe puple schulde be demed to do faire doynge ķat is to preysynge 
and to leue foule doyng ķat is to blamyng. 
Pan of al ķat forsaide foure of principate, 
of conseile, of eld hal, 
and of ķe puple, 
as it longeķ to a philosofer, 
we schal schortlich speÞe in ķis ii partie of ķis iii book; 
but first we schal speÞe of suche principate. 
v Book III Part II Chapter II Tercio Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer distingweth sex maner principatus of ķe whiche iii ben good and ķre ben euel. 
For ķe principatus 
ķat been iclepede % ķe regne (<monarchia>), aristocracia, policia ben ķre good principates; tiraundise, eligarchia, demo|graccia ben euel princi- col. pates. 
For ķere ķe philosofer techeķ 
to knowe good principates fro euele. 
For if in eny lordschipes oķer principate 
ķe comyn profit is desired and profit of alle citeseins 
after here astaat, 
ķanne it is good and rigtful; 
but if profit of certeyn men 
is desired 
and ouersettynge of oķere, 
so it is euel and vnritful. 
Panne in ķis wise 
by ķe philosofers wey we may taÞe suffisauntes principates 
to ķe wrongful and rigtful, 
for in a citee oķer in a nacioun is lord, fewe, oķer manye lordes. 
öif lord desireth comyn profit and profite of sogettes, 
ķanne ķat lordschipe is icleped monarchia and a regne: 
for a kyng scholde desire comyn profite. 
A n d if ķat oon lord desireth 
not ķe comyn profit 
but ouersetteķ oķer men 
by cyuel myt 
and powere and ordeynek alle thinges 
to his owne profit, 
he is no kyng 
but a tyraunt. 
Panne of lordschepe of oon comeķ tweyne principates - 
oon riötful whanne a kyng is lord for ķe comyn profit, 
and anoķer wrongful whanne a tyraund is prince 
for his owne profit. 
But som tyme a citee 
is irewelede not by lord bote 
by som lordes 
and ķat by fewe. 
For we seie ofte in ķe citee of Rome 
ķat whanne ķat senatours faillede, 
in ķe mené tyme 
or anoķer senatour 
was ichose alle ķe puple of Rome 
were irewled by fewe men. 
For twelf men were ichose ķat were good men 
and of good fame 
and ķei reweled al ķe citee, 
and so euel dedes were distingwed by diuersete of principates. 
A n d of som euele dede it was iseide 
ķat it was idoo 
in ķe tyme of a senatoure, 
and of som euel dede | it was iseid 
ķat it was idoo in ķe f. tyme of good men. 
if a cite is ireweled not by on alione but by fewe, 
ķanne ķilÞe fewe ben vertuous 
and goode and desiren ķe comyn profit; 
and ķanne suche a principate 
is icleped aristocracia, 
ķat is to menyng ķe pryncipate of good men and vertuous. 
And ķerof it comeķ 
ķat ķe gretteste men 
in ķe puple ķat scholde rewle puple ben icleped optimates, 
for ķei ķat scholde be ouer oķer men scholde be optimi, best. 
But [i]f ķilÞe fewe men ķat rewelen ben not vertuous noķer desiren ķe comyn profit 
but here owne wynnynge 
and ben riche and ouersetten oķer men 
and desiren here owne profit, 
suche a principate 
is icleped eligarchia 
as it were ķe principate of riche men. 
Panne of lordschipe of fewe men comeķ twey manere of principates; 
on is vertuous 
as whanne som men ben lordes for ķei ben vertuous and desiren ķe comyn profit, 
and ķe oķer is wrongful 
as whanne sum men ben lordes not for ķei ben good men 
but for ķei ben riche men 
and ouersetteķ oķer men. 
r o Pe ķridde, 
principates mowe be distingwed 
by ķat ķat manye men 
ben lordes in a citee. 
For comounliche in citées of Italie 
ben manye lordes 
as al ķe puple, 
for ķere nedeķ assent of alle ķe puple 
in makynge of statutes 
and in chesyng of lordes 
and greet officers 
and also of iuges 
to correcte trespasses. 
For alwey ķere ķei a potestate oķer a lord be ichose 
and ipledet to rewle ķe citee, 
ut ķe puple haķ more lordschepe 
of ķe cite ķanne ķe potestate and lord ķat | 
is ichose and col. icleped. 
For al ķe puple schal chese hym 
and amende hym 
if ķei doun amys, 
and ķe puple maÞen statutes 
ķat suche a lord mot nedes hoolde. 
Panne in suche a principate, 
ķere manye ben lordes 
as al ķe puple, 
is desired profit of nedy men, 
of mené persones, 
of riche men, 
and of alle men 
as heere astat axek; 
ķanne ķat principate is ritful. 
A n d for suche a principate haķ no name, 
ķe philosofer eueķ 
it a comyne name 
and clepe it policia. Policia and ordenaunce of cite is al on touchinge aile ķe principates ķat ben ķerinne, 
and principaliche ķe cheef princi­ pate ķat hath lordschipe 
of al ķe oķere. 
For polecia stondeķ more in ordre of ķe cheef principate 
ķat is in a cite. 
A n d eche ordenaunce of a cite 
may be cleped policia. 
Nathales ritful principate 
of ķe puple 
is icleped policia, 
for it hath no propre name. 
A n d gif it is ritful, 
we may clepe it suche a principate gubernacioun populi, 
rewelyng of ķe puple. 
But gif ķe puple 
ķat haķ suche lordschepe desireķ 
not profit of alle men after here owne astaat 
but tyraundisek 
and ouersetteķ riche men, 
ķanne is ķer anoķer maner principate 
and hatte democracia in Grew. 
And we may clepe suche principate 
wrongful doyng of ķe puple. 
Panne it is declared 
how manye principates 
ķer ben 
and whiche ķerof ben gcod 
and whiche ben iuel. Chapter III 
For we thinÞen to declare what is best policie 
and which is best principate, 
after that we hauen itold maners of principates 
and whiche ķerof ben rigtļful 
and whiche wrongful, 
it is to declarynge among prin- f. cipates 
which is ķe beste. 
And comynliche foure weyes ben assigned to preue ķat a regne is best principate, 
and ķat it is bettre ķat a cite oķer a prouynce be irewled 
by on ķan by manye, 
wheÞer ķilÞe manye be swiÞe manye oķer fewe. 
Pe firste wey is itaÞe 
by vnyte and pees ķat scholde be desired 
in a cite 
and in a regne as ķe ende. 
Pe seconde, 
by cyuel myt and power ķat nedeķ to ķe rewelyng of a citee. 
Pe ķridde, 
by doynge ķat we seen in kynde. 
Pe ferķe and last, 
by doynge ķat we hauen ilerned 
by experience and asay in rewelyng of citées. 
Pe firste is declared in ķis wise. 
For pees and vnytee of citeseyns scholde be his final entent 
ķat eueķ ķe lawe as heel is 
fynal entent of ķe phisician, 
and he ķat is by hymself 
on may maÞe best ķis vnyte and acord. 
For in a principate 
is more vnyte gif 
onliche oon prince is V Book III Part II lord ķanne ķei manye princes were lordes. 
For gif ķer ben manye princes in a principate, 
neuere pees may bee 
in suche a principate 
but ķulÞe manye princes 
be oned and acordyng; 
for al kyng is for som cause and ķe cause is more parfit. 
Panne if pees and acord is among citeseyns 
vnder manye princes, 
and ben as it were oon, 
ķanne if ķer were oonlich oon prince among hem, 
here pees mygte not sone be disturbled. 
Pe seconde wey to preue ķe same 
is itaÞe 
by ciuyl myt 
and power 
ķat nedeķ 
in rewelyng of citées. 
For ķe more a vertue is ioned, 
ķe more stronge it is; 
for eche vertue ioned 
is more strong ķan itself departed, 
as it is J declared 
in libro De Causis 
and in Proposicionibus Procli. 
For we col. seen ķat if manye men drawen a schep 
but ķei be oned 
and drawe alle at ones, 
Þey schulle neuere drawe ķe schip. 
But if al ķe strengķe ķat 
is in manye men drawynge 
were igadred al in to oon manere, 
ķanne ķe strengķe were more ioned 
and ķerfore pei were pe more strong in drawynge. 
Wherfore foif] 
a[l] cyuel myt 
and powere ķat 
is in manye princes 
were igadred in oon prince, 
ķanne ķat prince were more myty 
ķan ķe oķer 
and myte betere rewle ķe polecie and ķe citee. 
Pe ķridde wey is itaÞe by doynge ķat we seen in kynde. 
For in al kynde rewelyng alwey al ķat rewelyng is iordeyned 
to som oon ķat is cheef; 
as if in ķe same body 
ben diuerse membres iordeyned to diuerce office and diuerse meuynges, 
ķat is on [me]mbre of whos meuynge springeķ al ķe oķer meuynges in ķe body 
as al meuyng of oķer membris comeķ of meuyng of ķe hert. 
Also if on kyng is imade of many and diuerse elementes, 
ķer is on as ķe soule rewlyng and holdyng togeders ķe elementes 
in ķe bodi of a beest ķat ķat body of a best holde togeders. Perfore, circa finefm] primy libri De Anima, 
it is iseid ķat ķe soule conteyneth ķe body more ķan aenward. 
Also oon body of heuene 
as ķe firste meuable body 
rewlek ķe nethere meuynges 
and is cause ķerof. 
And in al ķe worlde is oon G 
o d ķat rewlek and disposeķ 
alle oķere thinges. 
Also for it is kyndelich for bene to lyue in companye, 
it is kyndelich for hem to be vnder oo kyn[g]e. 
Panne if we taÞen heede 
of alle kyndelich thinges, 
alwey we schal see ķat eche multitude 
is | reducte f. 
and ireweled by oon pat is chef. 
For as it is kyndeliche pat multitude comeķ of oon, 
so it is kyndelich ķat it be reducte in to oon 
and be ireweled by on. 
Panne ķe rewelynge of puple 
and of multitude is good 
if it is ritful, 
but ķe rewelyng of fewe is bettre 
for it comeķ nere to vnyte. 
A n d best rewelyng is monarchia ķat is ķe rewelyng of oon kyng, 
for ķerinne is more parfite vnyte. 
Pe ferķe wey is itaÞe 
by doynge ķat we seen in contrées and in citées. 
For we knowen and seen ķat citées ķat ben not vnder oon kyng ben in pouert and in meschef 
and not in pees 
but ben agreued 
w i k r stryf and werre. 
A n d citées ķat ben vnder oon kyng agenward, 
and hauen non werre 
but pees and píente. Chapter IV 
It semeth ķat ķe philosofer, iii Poleticorum, 
toucheth ķre resons 
by ķe whiche it semeth ipreued ķat betere it is ķat a citee oķer a prouynce be reweled 
by many ķan by oon. 
For ķre semeķ nedful in a prince 
to rewle wel his puple. 
For first, 
he schal haue good witte and resoun; ķe seconde, rigtful entent and desire; 
ķe ķridde, parfit stedefastnesse. 
Herby we may taÞe ķre resons to preue 
ķat it is good 
ķat many ben princes 
and not onliche oon. 
Pe firste wey is declared in pis wise. 
For manye igene mowe see more ķan oon 
and manye hondes mowe do more ķan on 
and manye wittes mowe knowe more ķan oon, 
wherfore gif many ben princes, 
resoun is ķe more cleer for Þey knowen more ķan oon prince alone. 
Perfore, iii Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer seith ķat manye suche princes 
maÞen as it | were oo man wik manye eygen and many hondes. 
Wher- col. 
fore suche principate is best, 
for suche a man ymaad in ķat wise and multitude of princes 
is most mygty in principate. 
Pe seconde wey to preue ķe same 
is itaÞe 
by ritful entent and desire pat nedeķ in a prince. 
A n d pe prince haķ good entent gif he desire 
not his owne profit 
but ķe comyn profit. 
Panne ķe lasse ķe comyn profit is desired, 
ķe worse is ķe principate. 
But if manye ben princes 
ķei he<y> desire here owne profit 
ut Þey leuen 
not al Þe desire of comyn profit. 
But gif oon is prince alone 
and he desireķ his owne profit, 
for Þe profit of oon is 
as it were pryuat benemeng profit, 
ķat desireth his owne profit 
at al forsaÞeķ 
as it were 
at al ķe desire of comyn profit. 
Panne bettere it is 
to manye be princes ķan oon. 
Pe ķridde wey is itaÞe 
by stedfastnesse 
ķat nedeķ in a prince. 
For a prince scholde be ritful 
and stedefast rewle so 
ķat he scholde not be so corrupte noķer ouercome 
by wrathe noķer 
by coueitise noķer 
by oķer passions. 
But as Þe philosofer seith, 
oon is sonnere ouercome ķanne manye. 
Panne better it is ķat manye be lordes 
Þan oon. 
Panne it is to wetynge 
Þat ķe philosofre, 
iii Poleticorum, 
treteķ ķis doute and assigneķ manye resons to preue 
ķat best it is ķat manye be lordes. 
And afterward in ķe same book 
he toucheķ certeyne poyntes 
by Þe whiche suche obieccions and argumentes mowe be assoilled. 
And it is not to vnderstondynge 
ķat ķe philosofer 
wolde mené ķat lordschepe of manye 
is sympliche bettere 
Þan lordschipe of oon gif eiķer is rigtful, 
| f. for he seith ofte in ķe same Politiķes ķat a regne is most worthi princi­ pate; 
for among rigtful principates, 
principate of on ķat is icleped a regne is best. 
A n d among euele principates of oon 
ķe principate 
ķat is comonliche icleped tiraundise is ķe worste. 
But heere of it schal be v Book III Part II 
spoÞe here after. 
For it schal be declared ķat ķe prince<ipate> 
of a kyng is best; 
so ķat to ķe more good 
ķe more euel is contrarie, 
ķe principate of a tyraunt is worst. 
A n d it is not bettre ķat manye ben lordes rigtfulliche ķan oon; 
nathalees neuere manye mowe rigtfulliche be lordes 
but in so moche as ķei holden ķe stede of on 
and hauen among hem vnite and acord. 
But as it is iseide tofore, 
eche thing is for som cause 
and ķe cause is more parfit. 
Wherfore gif manye ben lordes rigtfulliche 
in so moche as ķei holden in stede of on, 
it is more rigtful and more worthi 
ķat on haue rigtful principate 
in Þew manere ķan many. 
Panne it is to grauntynge 
ķat a regne 
is most worthi principate 
and ķat it is betere ķat oon haue rigtful lordschepe ķanne manye. 
But for to assoille ķe forsayde obieccions and argumentes 
it is to wetynge ķat for manye men 
knowen mo kynges ķan oon man doķ, 
and oon is corupte sonere ķan manye, 
and manye mowe not so erre out of ķe entencioun of Þe comyne profit 
as oon may alione, 
ķerfore gif an hool principate is imaad 
and on prince oķer on kynge is lord 
in al ķe hool principate oķer in al Þe hool regne, 
ķe philosofer, iii Poleticorum, 
seith ķat thilÞe prince oķer kyng scholde taÞe to hym manye wise men 
for to haue manye eyen, 
and manye good | men and col. vertuouse to haue manye feet and hondes, 
and scholde be so imaad 
on man 
with many eyene, many fete, 
and many hondes. 
Panne it may not be iseid 
ķat suche on prince knowe not many thynges; 
for in so moche 
as it longeķ 
to rewelyng of ķe regne, 
it semeķ ķat thilÞe prince 
oķer kyng knowek alle thinges 
ķat alle thilÞe wise men knowen. 
Noķer it may be seid 
ķat he may be sone corupte. 
For whanne a kyng desireth 
to be rigtful lord, 
it is not possible ķat he be corrupte 
but al ķe counsaille and aile ķe wyse men and good men 
Þat he % asocieth to hym ben peruerted and corrupted also. 
For suche on desireķ most ķe comyn profit. 
Perfore gif it is so, 
it is worthi ķat he be prince; 
and gif it is oķer wise 
as gif he forsaÞeķ 
consaile and companye of wise men 
and goode and folwek his owne heed 
and his owne appetite, 
ķanne he is no kynge 
but a tyraunt. 
Panne it were not bettere 
ķat suche on were a lord ķanne manye 
but his lordschipe were worst; 
for as it is declared 
tofore and schal be declared here after more playnliche, 
tyranddyse is ķe worste principate. Chapter V 
O n caas som man wolde wene ķat bettere it is ķat dignitee of kyng and of prince passe by eleccioun ķan by heritage. 
For gif ķe soķenesse of ķis doute 
is iseie atte firste sigt, 
it semeķ ķat he ķat douteķ 
wheÞer it is bettere ķat dignité 
of a kyng passe 
by elección oķer by heritage douteķ wheÞer it is better to maÞe a lord 
by art oķer by lot. 
For gif a kyng is maad by eleccioun, 
it semeķ ķat suche rewelyng is not iput in aventure and fortune 
but it is imaad by art for ķe best and wisest | 
f. i scholde be ichose. 
But gif it is ido by heritage, 
ķe rewelynge is iput apon a lot 
in auenture and fortune, 
for it is vncerteyne 
what manere man ķe child 
schal be ķat schal haue ķe heritage 
and dignyte of kyng. 
Panne sympliche for to speÞe, 
betere it is ķat a prince be maad 
by elec­ cioun ķan by heritage. 
But [for] in ķis matere 
comynliche men hauen compte appetite, 
takynge heede of beryng [and] condicions of men 
ķat we seen by assay, 
it semeķ more spedful to regne 
and to cite ķat ķe lord be maad 
by heritage ķan by eleccioun. 
And gif condicions of men ben iknowe, 
by ķre weyes we may declare ķat bettere 
it is ķat suche rewelynge passe 
by heritage ķan by eleccioun. 
Pe firste wey is itaÞe 
by ķe selue kyng 
ķat rewelek ķe puple; 
ķe seconde, 
by ķe sone Þat schal be heire; 
ķe ķridde by ķe puple 
ķat schal be so irewlet. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For, i i Poleticorum, 
ķe philos­ ofer seiķ ķat it passeķ spekynge of greet likynge it is to haue som what proper, 
for what is kyndelich 
may not be idel and veyn 
and it is kynde­ liche 
ķat eche man loue hymself; 
ķanne ķe more ķat a kyng trowek ķat a regne 
is his owne proper good, 
ķe more kyndeliche he is ķe more besy aboute ķe profit of ķe regne. 
Panne gif a kyng trowek 
ķat he schal be prince 
ouer a regne not onliche 
for his lif tyme 
but also his heritage 
in his owne children, 
so he w o l trowe ķe more ķat ķe good 
of ķe regne is his owne good 
and be more besy ķere aboute. 
And for al ķe kynde of ķe fader resteķ in children and fadres ben gret|liehe imeued to pies- col. 
ynge and likynge of ķe children, 
ķerfore a kyng wik besynesse ķat a may he is imeued to brynge and Þepe ķe regne in good estaat gif he knowek ķat his children 
schal be lordes ķerof. 
But, iii Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer treteķ of ķis mater 
and seith ķat it is hard 
ķat fadres mowe so betaÞe rewelynge of regne 
to here owne children, 
and meneķ ķat ķat it is as it were a vertue of God 
and passeķ ķe manere of mankynde. 
But on caas ķe philosofer seide so for comyn­ liche 
in olde tyme kynges 
bycome tyrantes 
and ķe heritage of ķe fader dureth 
not longe to ķe children in ķat wise. 
Oķer gif it is sympliche iseide 
ķat ķat is a vertue of God, 
but for kynges and princes bere hem­ self weel in seruice of God, 
seide ķe children regnen after here fadres, 
and gif ķe children regnen, 
vnneķe oķer neuere regneķ ķe [children] children. 
Panne by Þe kyng, 
for Þei scholde be Þe more besy aboute Þe prophit of ķe regne, 
we may argue ķat it is spedful ķat rewelyng of regne passeķ to children by heritage. 
Pe seconde wey to preue ķe same 
is itaÞe by hym ķat schal fonge ķe charge of ķe regne. 
For as here maners ķat ben neweliche imaad riche ben comynliche worse ķan here maners ķat ben riche in olde tyme, 
so here maners ķat ben newe imaad lordes 
and hauen cyuel mygt and r Book III Part II 
powere ben worse ķanne here 
maners ķat ben lordes of olde tyme. 
For suche conneķ not suffre fortune, 
for newe reryng and vpsettynge of a kyng 
is as it were a | certeyne 
vnkunnynge of dignyte of a kyng. f. i 
For comynliche suche bycomen tyrauntes 
and proute of herte 
and regnen vnwiseliche. 
But gif rewelyng of regne passeķ by heritage, 
here children ben not mysproud noķer to highe of herte, 
for ķei accounten not greet ķeig ķei haue ķat lordschepe 
ķat here fader hadde. 
Panne by ķe children 
ķat schal haue ķe fader heritage, 
for ķe regne scholde not be vnwiseliche ireweled noķer kynges rewle turne in to tyraundise, 
it is spedful ķat kynges dignité passe by heritage to ķe ofspryng. 
Pe ķridde wey is itaÞe by ķe puple 
ķat he schal be rewled 
by suche rewelynge. 
For vsage is as it were ķe oķer kynde, 
wherfore by vsage rewelyng is imade 
as it were kyndelych rewelyng. 
Panne gif ķe puple 
is obedient longe tyme 
by vsage 
to ķe fadres 
and to ķe children, 
ķei ben as it were kyndelich inclyned 
to be obedient with good wille. 
Panne for al kyng ķat is agenst wille 
is swiÞe heuy and chargous, 
for ķe puple scholde with ķe better wille be obedient 
to ķe kynges hestes, 
it is sped­ ful ķat kynges dignité passe by heritage. 
Panne settynge and hauynge a certeyne hous lynage of ķe whiche ķe kyng schal be taÞe seseķ plee and stryf, 
and doķ a wey tyraundise, 
and is as it were kynde †gift of God†. 
It seseth strif and plee, 
for ofte among chesers is strif 
for ķe eleccioun of a prince; 
ķerfore pees of Þe regne is disturbled. 
A n d it doķ awey tyraundise for, 
as it is declared tofore, 
ķei ķat regnen by eleccioun louen not so wel ķe profit of ķe regne 
as Þei ķat regnen by heritage; 
| and for a tiraund desireth not col. profit of ķe regne, 
‡ suche bycomen tyrauntes to sone. 
Also ķat maÞen a kynde†iftt† for Þe puple 
is as it were kyndeliche inclined 
to be obedient to ķe hestes 
of a kyng ķat regneķ by heritage. 
A n d herby it may be knowe ķat it is not oonliche spedful to regne 
to haue a certeyn lynage 
of ķe whiche ķe kyng schal be taÞe, 
but also it nedeķ to declare ķe persone. 
For as strif and plee riseķ gif 
it is vnknowe 
of what lynage ķe kyng scholde be taÞe, 
so riseķ strif and plee gif it is vnknowe what persone 
and what lynage scholde be kyng oķer prince. 
A n d it is not hard to declare suche a persone; 
for gif kynges dignité passe by heritage to ķe ofspring, 
it mot passe to ķe children. 
For by ķe lyne of sibradenesse children 
ben nexte to ķe fader and moder. 
A n d suche dignyte mot sonnere passe 
to maales ķan to feméis, 
for ķe maal can more resoun ķan ķe femel 
and is more bold of herte 
and lasse folwek passions. 
A n d among maales suche dignité 
mot passe raķer to ķe eldeste sone ķanne to ķe oķer; 
for as ķe philosofer seith in PoletiÞes, 
it is semelich ķat ķe gongere be obedient to ķe eldere. 
A n d also comonliche ķe faders louen most ķe eldeste sones. 
A n d for ķe kyng scholde haue more charge of ķe comyne profit of ķe regne, 
it is v spedful ķat a regne passe by heritage 
to ķe eldeste sone 
f o r Þ 
e fader scholde be more besy aboute ķe profit of ķe regne wetyng 
ķat it schal falle 
to his owne sone 
ķat he loueķ best. 
And gif me seith ķat som tyme ķe fader loueķ best ķe gongere children, 
suche resons and obieccions 
mowe be sone assoilled, 
for worÞes and particuler doynge of | mankynde falleķ 
not al vnder rigt rewle and f. i rit reÞenyng. 
Panne in suche matier 
it is inow to trete probableliche 
and to maÞe lawes 
ķat ben comynliche good and trewe. 
And for it was itouched 
tofore honde 
ķat gif kynges dignité passe by heritage, 
ķanne ķe rewelynge of ķe regne [is iput] 
vppon hap, fortune and lotte, 
for it is vnknowe 
what manere man ķe kynges sone w o l be good oķer euel, 
it schal be seid ķat 
vnneķe ben eny doynges of man­ kynde 
but ķei be som del iput in perel. 
But it nedeķ most to be waar of doynges 
ķat ben most iputte in peril. 
And we seen ķat many harmes riseķ 
where no kynde lord 
is in citées and regne, 
for som tyme ķerinne is no rewelere. 
And gif ķer is a rewelere, 
comynliche a tyrant[y]seķ. 
For we haue iseie manye harmes 
in suche rewelyng 
ķat were to longe 
to reÞene al arewe. 
Panne we may saye ķat 
it is spedful 
to ķe regne ķat ķe rewelynge passe to ķe kynges sone by heritage. 
And gif eny defaute is in ķe kynges sone ķat schal be heire, 
it may be amended by wise men 
and goode ķat ķe kyng scholde asocie to hym 
as hondes and eygene. 
But kynges and princes ben foule to blame gif ķei ben not swiÞe besy 
ķat here children 
be taugt 
in gouķe 
to haue connynge and good maners, 
for comyn profit of al ķe regne stondeķ ķerinne. 
A n d it is not inow Þat 
for Þe eldeste sone schal regne ķat ķerfore 
onlich he schulde be besyliche itaugt, for it is vnknowe what G o d ordeyneth 
and it is vnknowe wheÞere ķe eldere sone schal lyue 
and be eyre oķer noo. 
Perfore for ķe co|myn col. 
profit scholde not be in perile, 
aile ķe children scholde be besiliche iÞepte and itaugt. Chapter VI Qvynto Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer reÞeneķ ķre thinges 
in ķe whiche a kyng scholde passe oķere men, 
for he declareth ķat 
in olde tyme kynges were imaad 
by ķre manere passynge. First, 
by passynge in geuynge. 
For ķe puple perseyuek 
not but sencible good 
and ben ķerfore strongliche imeued to loue hem ķat ben liberal and geaf manye giftes and grete. 
Perfore in olde tyme manye kynges 
were imaad in ķat wise; 
for gif a man were goodlich 
to ķe puple 
and gaf hem giftes, 
Þey wolde loue hym and maÞe hym kyng. Pe seconde, 
a man may be maad kyng 
for passynge in vertuous dedes. 
For goode men and vertuous louen ķe comyn profit more ķan r Book III Part II priuate profit, 
ķerfore he ķat is iholde vertuous amonge ķe puple 
is iholde worthi to be kyng. 
Pe ķridde, 
ofte som man was imaad kyng 
for passynge in mygt and dignité. 
For it is probable to gentel men noble and mygti ben more aschamed ķan oķere men to do vile dedes, 
and for comynliche suche men ben worthi oķere ben iholde worthi to be princes, 
ķerfore in ķis wise manye were imaad kynges in olde tyme. 
Panne gif a kyng 
is igendred 
and imaad kyng for suche passynges, 
gif his generacioun is rigtful, 
it nedeķ ķat his passynge be Þe more large and p[ar]fit 
whanne he is kyng in dede. 
For we seek in kynde generaciouns ķat gif fuyre is igendred 
by rarefaccioun and strecchinge and heete, 
| for kynde worthe a fuyre 
by hetynge and strecchinge, 
it f. nedeķ ķat strecchynge 
and hete be more parfit 
in ķe fuyre whanne it is igendred 
and is fuyre in dede. 
Panne gif passynge in giftes 
and in vertuous dedes 
and in mygt and power may be cause 
w h i a man may lawefulliche be imaad kyng, 
it is semelich ķat suche passynge 
be more parfit 
in a prince whanne he is prince in dede. 
As it longeķ to ķis doyng, 
a kyng ķat w o l regne arigt scholde be besy aboute ķre: first, 
for to be loued of ķe puple; ķe seconde, 
to be besy for Þe comyne profit; 
ķe ķridde, 
for to chaste hem 
ķat meueķ stryf and discord and disturbleth ķe puple. 
Wherfore it is spedful 
for a kyng 
to haue ķe forseide 
ķre manere of passynges. 
For gif he is large of giftes, 
he schal be loued of ķe puple. 
A n d gif he passeķ in vertuous dedes, 
he schal be besy 
for ķe comyn profit; 
for gif a vertue desireķ good most, 
he desireth most good. 
Panne for ķe comyn profit 
and good is more good 
ķan eny synguler good, 
a good man and vertuous schal be more besy for ķe comyne good and profit ķan for any priuat ķat is benemyng good and propre. 
Pe ķridde, 
it is spedful ķat [he] haue greet cyuel mygt and powere for to chaste risares, scorners, 
ķat wolde desturble pees of ķe regne. 
For it is iknowe 
where inné a kyng scholde passe oķere men, 
it is to declarynge what diuersete is bytwene a kyng and a tyraunt. 
And, 
v Polet­ icorum, 
ķe philosofer toucheķ foure diuersete 
bytwene a tyraunt and a kyng. 
Pe first, 
for a kyng taÞeķ heede 
to ķe | comyne profit and a tyrand to col. his owne profit. 
For a kyngdome is a rigtful principate 
and tyraundise 
is euel and wrongful lordschipe, 
for ķe comune profit is better 
ķanne ķe profit 
of on euel and wrongful lord 
ķat forsaÞeth ķe comyne profit 
and taÞeķ hede 
to his owne profit. 
Of ķis first diuersete folwek ķe seconde, 
ķat a tyraunt desyreth likynge good 
and a kyng worschepful good. 
For as it passeķ speche how moche likynge a man haķ 
in his owne good, 
so it is as it were passynge speche 
how grete worschep folwek 
and how greet worschep he is worthi ķat desireth ķe comyn profit. 
Wherfore gif a tyraunt desire his owne profit, 
v it folwek ķat he desireth likynge good; 
but a kyng desirethworschepeful good, 
for he desireth ķe comyn profit. 
And of ķis seconde diuersete folwek ķe ķridde, 
ķat a tyraunt desireth moneye. 
For a tyraunt forsaÞeķ ķe comune profit 
and telleķ no pris 
but of his owne likynge 
and desireķ ķerfore most money trowynge by moneye 
to haue suche likynge. 
But a kyng desireķ vertue and ķat cite­ seyns be vertuous 
for ķerof comeķ 
most worschepful good and comyne profit. 
And of ķis diuersete ķe ķridde folwek ķe ferķe, 
ķat a tyraunt 
w o l not haue to warde of his bodye citeseyns ibore in his owne regne 
but he betaÞeķ to straungers 
al Þe warde and Þepyng of his body. 
But a kyng doķ agenward, 
for he knowek ķat he haķ most charge of ķe comyne profit of ķe regne 
and of ķe comunes 
and tresteķ most in hem 
Þat ben of ķe regne, 
and haķ ķerfore wardeyns 
for his body 
of his owne and not of I straungers. 
f. i Chapter VII 
By foure weyes we may declare ķat tyraundise is ķe worste lord­ schepe. 
Pe firste is itaÞe 
for suche lordschipe 
desireth lest ķe comyne profit. 
Pe seconde, 
for it is most vnkyndeliche lordschepe. 
Pe ķridde, 
for it is most greuous and neyful. 
Pe ferķe, 
for it letteķ most profit of cyteseyns. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For gif a kyng haķ lordschepe, 
he desireth ķe comyne profit; 
for he is no kyng 
but he be vertuous 
and desire ķe comyn profit. 
A n d so, iii Poleticorum, 
it is iseide ķat suche a prince 
is as ķeig 
it were departed 
in manye oķer as it were prince of multitude, 
for suche a prince desireķ profit of manye. 
Also gif manye ben lordes 
for ķei ben riche 
oķer iholde vertuous, 
oķer gif al ķe puple haķ ķe lordschipe 
for ķei ķat ben lordes 
in ķat wyse desireth 
not 
but here owne profit, 
gut in som wise ķei desiren ķe comyn profit 
for in ķat wise were manye princes 
and al profit of money 
is in som wise comyn profit. 
But gif a tyraunt is lord, 
for oon ķat is lord 
in ķat wise desireķ 
not 
but his owne profit, 
he desireķ not ķe comyn profit. 
Panne for a prin­ cipate 
is not rigtful 
but it be in som wise goddysch, 
and for ķerinne principaliche 
ķe comyn profit scholde be desired 
ķat is more goddische 
ķan eny singuler profit, 
ķe lasse comyn profit 
is desired in tyrauntes ķer is ķe worse principate. 
Circa principium quarti Poleticorum, 
ķe philos­ ofer toucheķ ķis resoun and seith ķat 
as a regne is best and worthiest policie 
(ķat is of kyng), 
so tiraundise is ķe worste. 
And ķe cause is, 
as it is iseide | ķer, 
fori tyraundise 
ys most ferre fro policie 
(ķat is wis domes col. and good ordenances) 
of ķe comyn profit. r Book III Part I I 
Pe seconde wey to preue ķe same 
is itaÞe for suche lordschipe 
is most vnkyndeliche. 
For worching is kyndeliche 
whanne me worchek 
in a thing as me scholde, 
wherfore a regne is kyndelich ireweled 
whan men ķat ben ķerinne ben ireweled 
as able to be reweled. 
And for man haķ fre w i l and resoun, 
man is kyndeliche ireweled 
as he is able to be reweled 
whanne he serueķ wilfulliche and isobedient freliche. 
Pe more wilful lordschepe of men is, ķe more kyndeliche it scholde be cleped. 
Panne tirandise is ķe worste principate, 
for it is most vnwilful 
and most agenst kynde, 
for it is most greuous to ķe sogettes. 
A n d , iiii Polet icorum, 
ķe philosofer toucheķ ķis resoun and seith 
ķat tyrandise 
is ķe worste principate, 
for no fre man suffreth wilfulliche suche principate. 
Pe ķridde wey is itaÞe 
for suche principate 
is moste noyful and greuous. 
For as ķe principate 
of a kyng is most profitable 
for it is most ioned, 
so tyraundise is most noyful and greuous. 
For whanne oon is lord in a principate, vertue and mygt is ioned ķere and is Þerfore best oķer worst principate. 
For gif ķe prince haķ rigtful desire, 
ķanne he is a kyng 
and ķe principate is best for 
by cause of mygt yoned 
for he may do moche good. 
A n d gif ķe prince hath euel desire and wrongful, 
ķanne he is a tyraunt 
and ķe principate is worst, 
for by cause ķat his mygt is ioned 
he may do moche harme. 
A n d , [v] Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer toucheķ ķis resoun 
and seith ķat tyraundise 
is | eligarchia f. extrema (Þat is Þe worst extrema), 
fanoynturef for it is most greuous to sogettes. 
T r e u y s a : 
whanne fewe men ben lordes and ben not good and vertu ous but riche and mygty and louen not ķe comune profit but desireķ here owne profite and ouersetteķ oķer men, 
suche principate 
is icleped eliga[r]chia. 
A n d here tirandise 
is icleped ķe worst eligarchia, 
for it is most greuous to sogettes. 
Pe ferķe wey is itaÞe 
for suche lor[d]schipe letteķ most profit of citesens. 
For a tyraunt fondeķ not onliche 
to do hem harme ķat ben in ķe regne 
but also he is besy 
to lette here most profit. 
And, v Polet­ icorum, 
ķe philosofer toucheķ certeyne profites 
ķe whiche a tyraunt fondeķ 
for to lette: pees, vertues and science; 
for tyrauntes wolle not 
Þat citeseyns haue pees and acord among hemsilf. 
Also Þei w o l not 
Þat citeseyns 
be magnifici and vertuous. 
(Magnifiais is he ķat maÞeķ grete worÞes). 
Also tyrauntes wolle not ķat citeseyns 
be wise and redy. 
A n d whi tirauntes letteķ 
Þe forseide good and profit in cyteseyns 
it schal be seid herafter. 
And be it inow at ķis tyme to knowe ķat tyraundise 
is ķe worste principate 
for ķe forsaide resons. 
A n d it is not hard to k 
n o w ķat kynges scholde be most besiliche ywaar 
ķat ķei be not princes by tyraundise; 
for Þe worse lordschepe a prince vseķ, 
Þe worse prince he is. 
Wherfore gif a kyng scholde do al ķe besynesse 
Þat he be not ķe worste, 
he scholde be most war 
Þat he be not lord by tyraundise, 
Þat is ķe worst principate. 
v Chapter VIII 
if a kyng oķer a prince w o l wel rewle his men and desireth to knowe 
what is his | offices, 
he schal besiliche taak hede of kyndelich col. thinges. 
For gif al kynde comeķ of G o d Þat is cheef prince 
and kyng of kynges 
and rewelek al Þe worlde and kynde moste rigtfulliche, 
by rewelyng ķat we seen springe 
in kyndeliche thinges 
and of Þat rewelynge scholde springe 
Þe rewlinge ķat scholde be itaugt 
in art of reweling of kyngis, 
for art folwek kynde. 
And in kynde we seen ķat first, 
kynde geueķ to kynges wherby 
Þei mowe come to here ende. 
Pe seconde, 
ķei geuen hem whereby ķei mowe putte of lettejs. Pe ķridde, 
by suche giftes ķei geuen hem wher­ by ķei mow come to here ende. 
As firste, 
kynde geueķ to ķe fuyre ligtnesse wherby it may meue vpward. [Pe seconde, 
kynde geueķ ķerto hete wherby it putteķ of contraries. 
Pe ķridde by ķat it taÞeķ of kynde ķe fuyre kyndeliche meueķ vpward.] Panne to good rewelyng 
and kyndeliche nedeÞ Þre. Firste, 
ķat ķe puple be so disposed 
ķat ķei mowe come to ķe ende Þat is desired. Pe seconde, 
Þat thinges be put of ķat letteķ comynge to suche an ende. 
Pe ķridde, ķat it be irewled and iholpe to suche an ende. 
For we seen of an arwe ķat schal be schote to a certeyne marÞe ķat first, 
it is imaad rigt and euene ķat it may ķe bettere come to ķe mark. 
Pe seconde, 
it is ifethered ķat it may ķe bettere Þerue ķe ayere 
ķat it be not ilet to come to ķe marÞe. 
Pe ķridde, 
it is ischote and ireweled to ķe marÞe. 
Panne a kyng and eche rewelere of puple 
is as it were an archere 
and ķe puple is as it were an arwe ķat schal be reweled to an ende as to good. 
Panne ķre longeķ 
to a kynges office, 
for first, 
ķei scholde be besy 
ķat his men haue wherby ķei mowe come to ķe ende ķat is desired. 
Pe seconde | wey, 
ķei schulde putte of lettes. 
Pe ķridde, 
f. i ķei scholde rewle his men to ķe ende. 
And kynges ķat seruen ķat puple 
may come to ķe ende ķat is desired 
and lyue wel ben ķre - vertues, 
kunynge, and outward good. 
Panne a kyng scholde be besy ķat in his regne 
be Studie of lettres 
and ķat ķer be manye wise men and slei[g]e. 
For wher is wisdom 
and welle of writyng it nedeķ ķat al ķe puple haue som lore ķerof. 
Panne for men ķat ben in ķe regne scholde not be wrapped 
in derÞenesse of vnkunnynge, 
it longeth to kynges and princes 
to be ful besy 
for Studie scole of letters. 
And as it schal be declared herafter, 
gif a lord of a regne avaunceķ not ķe Studie noķer he w o l ķat his men 
be wise and connynge, 
he is not a kyng 
but a tyrand. 
Pe seconde, 
for to come to ķe ende ķat is desired serueķ habitis, goode disposiciouns, and vertues. 
For it is not inow to knowe ķe ende 
and haue ķe inwit byschene 
but a man be vertuous 
and haue ordinate r Book III Part I I appetite ķat he may wilne to come to ķe ende. 
Panne it longeķ to ķe rector 
of a regne to ordeyne his sogettes to vertues. 
Pe ķridde, 
for to come to ķe ende ķat is desired 
in wise lif outward thinges 
helpeķ as instrumentes. 
Panne kynges and princes schulde rewle citées and règnes so 
Þat here sogettes haue inow of outward thinges [ķat] serue to lyue wel and to come to ķe ende ķat is desired in wise lif. 
And how ķat it may be do 
and how a cite scholde be ordeyned for to haue ķerinne kynges 
ķat seruen to suffisaunt lyuynge ķeig it be som deel declared tofore it it schal be more clerelich declared here after. 
For it is I iknowe Þat it longeķ 
to a kynges office 
to be besy aboute col. kynges by Þe whiche Þe puple may come to Þe ende Þat he desireķ, 
it is to declaryng how it longeķ to kynges and princes 
to putte of lettes Þat letten men 
to come to Þe ende, 
Þe whiche ben ķre. 
A n d on ķerof springeķ 
as it were of kynde; 
ķe oķer, 
of schrewednesse of men; 
ķe ķridde, 
of euel wille of enemyes. 
Pe firste is declared in ķis wise. 
For in hemself men ben dedliche 
and mot nedes dye, 
ķerfore it is ķat [for] 
ķei mowe not in hemself dure alwey, 
Þei desiren kyndeliche 
to be perpetual 
in here owne children 
wheÞer Þe children be kyndelich 
of here owne body 
oÞer ifonge oķer wise 
and icleped here children. 
(And a childe ķat is ifonge in ķat wise is icleped filius adoptiuus, 
a wel welled sone.) 
For it semeķ to a man 
ķat he mygte lyue gif he mygte ordeyne his eyre 
after his owne wille after his deķ. 
Panne ķe pesible staat 
may be disturbled and pees of Þe citee and ende ķat is desired in politik lif but kynges and princes be besy how heritage schal passe to hem ķat comeķ 
after hem ķat passeķ. 
Panne remeuyng of oon ķat most letteķ good wise lif is good ordeynynge how here heritage 
ķat deyen may come to ķe ofspringe. 
Pe seconde, pesible astaat of citee and of regne is som tyme ilette 
by schrewednesse of citeseyns. 
For som ben so schrewede ķat Þei wollen alwey greue oķere men. 
Panne for Þe pees of ķe regne 
scholde not be ilette, 
kynges and princes scholde be besy 
to destroye passynge euel doers 
and to chaste hem ķat trespassen. 
| f. i Pe ķridde, 
suche lete comeķ 
of euel wil of enemyes. 
For it were as it were not worthi 
to voide inward desese 
but outward peril were iput of, 
ķanne it longeķ 
to a kynges office 
to be so besy 
about cyuel mygt and powere 
and aboute sleyÞe of armede men 
ķat he may put of woodnesse of enemyes. 
And how Þat scholde be do it 
schal be declared playnliche 
in ķe ķridde partie of ķis ķridde 
n ķe tretis of batailles. 
For it is declared how kynges and princes scholde be besy 
how here puple scholde haue wherby 
to come to ķe ende 
Þat he desireth, 
and how ķei scholde putte of lettees, 
it is to declaryng 
how Þei scholde rewle hem to ķe ende 
and heere ben ķre. 
For 
first,Þei scholde amende ķe defautes - 
as gif ougt lacÞeķ 
to good rewelyng of Þe citee, 
ķat v scholde be amended. 
And ķat may be doo 
by counsaille of wise men, 
and herof we schul speÞe herafter. 
Pe seconde, good ordenance and good statute 
is to be Þepte and iholde. 
Pe ķridde, good doers and namelichj 
he ķat helpeth 
Þe comyn profit scholde be rewarded. 
For ķei amendyng of defautes 
and Þepyng of good ordenance 
helpe moche ķat ķe puple 
may be reweled 
to ķe ende, 
ut it semeķ ķat rewardynge 
of good dedes helpeķ most. 
For as it is iseid, 
iii Ethicorum, capitulo De Fortytudine, 
among hem ben men most fortes, 
among ķe whiche men ķat ben fortes ben most iworscheped. 
(And heere he is icleped fortis 
ķat wol fite whanne it nedeķ 
and whare it nedeķ 
and for what cause it nedeķ and aõenst wham it nedeķ 
and as it nedeķ.) 
Also among hem ķ[er] ben wise men and goode, 
among ķe whiche wise men | 
and good ben a rewarded. 
Panne it semeķ ķat it longeķ 
to a col. 
kynges office to be besy aboute ķe forsaide ķre. Chapter IX 
We may reÞene ten ķat 
a verrey kyng scholde do 
and a tyraunt fayneķ 
to do ķe same. 
And ķeig ķulÞe ten be som del conteyned in kynges 
ķat ben itreted tofore, 
nathales for as it is ofte iseide 
in moral matere general speche serueķ not no[r] profiteķ litel, 
ķerfore it is wel idoo to reÞene ķulÞe ten al arewe. Forst, 
for it longeķ ķat a verrey kyng 
to be most besy 
aboute ķe comyne profit 
and profit of ķe regne, 
and ķat ķei be besi to spende rentes 
in profite of ķe comynte 
and of ķe regne. 
And tyrauntes feynek to do ķe same, 
naķales ķei doun not ķe same. 
But as ķe philosofer seith, 
ķei spenden in hoores and strumpetes, 
in flaterers 
and in oķere vnworthie persones. Pe seconde, ķe rector of a regne scholde not onlich ordeyne 
and spende rentes 
in ķe profite of comynte of ķe regne, 
but also ķei schulde specialich Þepe and saue ķe good 
of ķe comynte 
and of Þe regne 
and ķe lawes of Þe regne. 
And ķei tirauntes feyne 
to do ķe same, 
it ķei doun it not 
butÞei pelien oķere men 
and bynemen here good. 
Pe ķridde, 
kyng and prince scholde not schewe hemself 
to dredful and cruel noķer be to homeliche, 
but ķei scholde seme sad persones and worschepful; 
and ķat may not be withoute vertue. 
Perfore a verray kyng 
is verrey vertuous, 
and a tiraunt is not vertuous 
but feynek hym self vertuous. 
Pe ferķe, 
a kyng scholde despise noon 
of his sogettes 
and do no man wrong 
noķer in douõttres noķer in wyues, 
noķer in persone | f. i noķer in oķer thinges. 
And gif it happeķ 
ķat eny of ķe regne forfeteķ, 
noķer for despit noķer for euel wil, 
but for comyn good he schal chaste hym by lawe. 
A n d tyraunt doun not so; 
but for ķei desiren moneye r Book III Part II and likynge, 
ķei don wrong to citeseyns in wyues and dougtres and reyuen hem here good. 
Pe fifte, kynges and princes scholde not onliche louye here owne mayne 
and be homelych and louye gentel men 
and noble and barouns and oķere by ķe whiche ķe good astaat of ķe regne may be saued, 
but also, 
as Þe philosofer seith in Politiķes, 
Þei scholde maÞe here owne wifes 
be hoomliche and goodlich 
to ķe wyues of ķe forsayde men. 
For wymmen drawen swiÞe here housbondes 
to here owne wille, 
for eche man is inclyned 
so ķat he w o l not displese his owne leuest. 
Wherfore gif wyfes of noble men 
and of oķere 
by ķe whiche good staat 
of ķe regne is isaued seyÞe ķat 
ķei ben dispised of ķe princes 
wif oķer of a kynges wif, 
ķei w o l maÞe here housbondes 
to meue parties 
to maÞe strif 
in ķe regne oķer in ķe principate. 
Panne a good rector of a regne oķer of a citee scholde bere hymself in ķis wise. 
A n d a tyraunt doun not so, 
but he is mysproute of herte and despisen oķere. 
Wherfore noķer he noķer persones ķat ben nyg hem ben goodlich to oķere men. 
Panne it semeķ ķat a tyraunt haķ to doyng of a verrey kyng 
but ķat is ifeyned; 
for in so moche as he is a tyraunt, 
he doķ not as verrey kyng in dede. 
Pe sixte, 
a verrey kyng scholde be moderate 
in mete and drynÞe 
and in seruice of Venus, 
for he scholde not be despised 
of his sogettes. 
For as it is iseide, 
v Ethicorum, 
he ķat is sobre 
is not despised 
but he ķat | is cc dronÞe. 
A n d tyrauntes don not so 
for ķei desiren not but here owne profit and money and lust and likynge. 
A n d for lust most and likynge 
is in mete and drynÞe 
and in sencible lecherie, 
tirauntes withoute refraynynge 
vsen such lust and likynge. 
And git worse, 
as ķe philosofer meneķ, 
v Poleticorum, 
manye tyrauntes 
not onliche ben intemporat 
but also Þey wollen be holde intemporate and trowen ķat men acounten hem 
in greet felicite gif ķei ben eche day 
in greet outrage 
of mete and drynÞe, 
in dronÞenesse 
and in greet festes. 
But ķei scholde not do in ķat wise for gif ķei 
were temporate for ķei scholde not be despised of ķe puple, 
ķei scholde not schewe intemporatnesse. 
For so[b]eyrnesse is ipreysed as intemporatnesse of lecherie and glotonie ben despised. 
Pe seuenķe, 
a verrey kyng scholde heighte and strengķe citées, casteles and townes 
ķat ben in ķe regne 
ķat it be ķe betere iknowe ķat he be procurator of ķe comyne profit 
whanne a tyraund 
is besy aboute his owne profit. 
Pe eigte, 
ķe philosofer seith ķat a verrey kyng scholde worschepe wyse men and goode and strangers 
so ķat me scholde wene ķat Þey scholde not be so yworschepped in here owne contreye ķoug ķei were at home. 
A n d so don not tyrauntes, 
and it schal be declared heerafter 
for he worschepeth not wise men 
and goode but destroyen hem. 
Pe nynÞe, 
a verrey kyng scholde not by wrong 
and vnrigt byneme oķere men lordschepe. 
For as it is iseid [in] Poletic[is] reynyng dureķ lengere ouer fewe ķan ouer manye. 
And ķat is nameliche soķ gif suche multitude of cyuel myt and power 
is ygete with may | strie and w i k f. a wrong. 
And, v Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer reherseķ 
how a certeyn kyng hadde ilefte a partye of his kyngdom on caas 
for he hadde longe holde it with wrong. 
But he was blamed of his wif 
ķat seide ķat he scholde be aschamed to leue 
a lasse regne to his children 
ķanne he hadde ifonge of his fader. 
Pe kyng answerde and seide ķat ķei he lefte hem 
a lasse regne in quantité, 
nathalees he lefte to hem 
a grettere regne 
and more induryng of tyme. 
A n d tyrauntes doķ not so; 
for ķei ķei feyne here wey to doo ritfullich, 
ut in manye doynges ķei maÞen here lordschepe more and more wrongfulliche and benemen oķere men here heritages with maystrie and with wrong. 
Pe tenķe and ķe laste, 
kynges scholde bere hem wel in Goddes seruice. 
For as ķe philosofer meneķ, 
ķe puple is söget 
at ķe folle 
to a kyng 
ķat ķei trowen ķat werschepek 
G o d and haķ G 
o d to his frend. 
For ķe puple trowen 
ķat suche a kyng doķ 
alwey ritfullich 
and no kyng wrongfulliche. 
But heerto we may maÞe anoķer betere resoun sayeng ķat gif G 
o d is a kynges frend 
by his ordenaunce ķat knowek al kyng, 
and by his myte ķat no kyng may wikstonde, as it is spedful 
for his sauacioun he schal alwey wel spede 
in his worÞes and dedes. 
Also ofte for holynesse of ķe kyng G 
o d doķ moche good to hem ķat ben in ķe regne. 
And last we saide ķat a kyng scholde bere hym wel in Goddes seruice, 
for ķat scholde be ķe ende and complement (folfillyng) of oķere, 
for ķerto alle oķere doynges ben iordey|ned. 
Panne a col. verrey kyng in dede bereķ hym wel in Goddes seruice verreyliche, 
and a tyraunt is not suche oon 
but feyne on caas ķat he is suche on. Chapter X Qvinto Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer toucheķ manye cauteles of ķe whiche 
as it longeķ to ķis doyng 
we may reÞene ten 
by ķe wyche a tyraunt fondeķ 
to Þepe hymself in his lordschipe. 
Pe firste cautel of a tyrant 
is sleynge and destroyenge of excellent men. 
For whanne a tyraunt loueķ 
not but his owne profit, 
excellent men and noble ķat ben in ķe regne mowe not suffry ķat but arisen aenst hym. 
A n d whanne ķe tyraunt knowek ķat 
he is a suche oon, 
he ķenÞeķ not but how he may destroye and slee excellent men. 
A n d ut whanne som men wolle be tyrauntes, 
he sleeth not onliche oķere excellent men 
but also ķei poysenen here owne breķeren 
and here owne nye cosyns; 
and ķat is toÞene of ķe worste tyrandise. 
But a verrey kyng doķ aenward and desireķ ķe comyn profit 
and knowek ķat he is iloued 
among ķe comyns 
of ķe regne and sleeth not 
but saueķ excellent men gentile and noble, 
and moche more his owne cosyns 
by ķe whiche ķe good Staat 
of ķe regne 
may be saued and iÞepte. Book o III Part II 
Pe seconde eau tel of a tyraund 
is destroyenge of wise men. 
For Ipei knowen ķat ķei doun 
aenst resoun and desireth not comyn profit 
but his owne, 
ķerfore Þey wolde ķat alle his sogettes 
were lewede and vnkonnynge 
lest ķei knowe 
al his wikÞednesse 
and excite puple agenst hym. 
For alwey he ķat doķ euele hateķ rit 
and loueķ not wise men, 
| f. for ķei wolde not ķat his worÞes be blamed; 
wherfore a tyraunt doķ 
euel worÞes and dedes 
and destroyen wise men 
wik al his myt. 
And a verrey kyng doķ ķe verrey contrarie knowyng 
ķat he doķ rit and resoun and saueķ wise men. 
A n d he avaunseķ and worschepek hem for ķei k[n]owen his good doynge 
and conforteķ ķe puple to louye hym. 
Pe ķridde is not suffryng studies and loore. 
For a tyraund in so moche 
as he is soche 
oon not onliche destroyeth wise men, 
but also for he barreth ķe wey 
and forbedeķ loore and studies 
lest som men be wise; 
for alwey he dredeķ 
to be vnderta 
and iblamed by wisdome. 
And a verrey kyng of ķe contrarie, 
and he avaunceķ and saueķ studies 
sayenge ķat ķe comyne profit and good staat of ķe regne is amended in so moche 
as it longeķ to ķe tente of ķe principate. 
Pe ferķe, 
he wolde not suffre felowschipes noķer gaderyng of frend­ es, 
for a tyraunt wol ķat citeseyns 
and oķere ķat ben in ķe regne 
be not felowys noķer iknowe togeders. 
For as ķe philosofer seiķ, 
knoweleche maÞeķ fey 
and trist for by cause ķat a man knowek anoķer 
and tristeķ on hym; 
and a tyrant loueķ not ķat, 
for ķei dreden lest citeseyns 
trist eche in oķer and rise 
aenst hym for wronges 
ķat he doķ hem. 
A n d a verrey kyng doķ aenward and soffreķ companye and felowschipe of citeseyns 
and w o l ķat citeseyns 
be knowe eche to oķer 
and triste eche in oķer. 
For by cause ķat he desireķ ķe profit of ķe citeseyns and of sogettes, 
it is kyndelich ķat he be loued of hem. 
Wherfore he w o l ķat ķei ben accorded and ioned 
and come togeders, 
for ķanne ķei louen ķe profit of ķe kyng ķe more wilfulļliche and wik on herte. 
For it were col. 
an iuel puple 
at al ķat knewe ķat ķei hauen a verray kyng ķat louen ķe comyn profit 
but ķei louede ķe kyng aenward. 
Pe fifte cautel of a tyraunt 
is to haue manye spies 
and assaye and knowe alle thinges 
ķat [cjiteseyns don. 
For whanne tyrauntes 
J knowe ķat ķei ben not beloued of ķe puple 
for ķei don hem 
moche harme and greuen hem 
in manye maner wise, 
ķei wollen haue manye spies 
ķat ķei mote mete wik hym gif eny of Ipe puple 
casteķ out aenst hem 
ķat ben tirantes. 
For whanne citeseyns trowen 
ķat a tiraunt haķ manye spies, 
ķei dar not come togeders 
to caste out aest hym. 
For ķei no spie be among hem so igadred, 
ut alwey ķei dreden 
lest som spies be among hem. 
A n d a verrey kyng Þepeķ not haue suche spies 
among citeseyns 
and among hem 
ķat ben in ķe regne 
but among enemyes and strangers. 
A n d whether kynges scholde haue spies 
in ķe regne for oķer cause ķan for risyng of ķe puple aenste hem 
it schal be seide here after. 
At ķis tyme it is inow to knowe ķat a kyng nedeķ not spies 
as a tyraunt nedeķ. 
Pe sixte cautel of a tyraunt 
[is] not oonliche he w o l not suffre felowschipe and companyes and frendschipe, 
but also felawschepe and frend schipe ķat is imaad ķei wolle desturble and destroye. 
For by frendes tyrauntes 
w o l destroye frendes, 
and ķe puple by grete men, 
and lordes by hemself. 
For ķei seen while discord 
is among citeseyns 
and among riche men, 
his powere may not sone be withstonde | 
for ķanne eche partye dreden oķere 
so ķat noķer partye arisen aenst ķe tyraunt. 
And a verrey kyng doÞ aenward, 
disturbleķ not hem ķat ben in Þe regne 
but norscheth pees 
and acord amonfg] hem. 
For elles he were not a verrey kyng, 
for elles he desireķ not ķe comyn profit. 
Pe seuenķe, 
he w o l maÞe his sogettes 
so pore ķat ķe tiraunt nedeķ no warde. 
For tyrauntes wollen ķat here sogettes 
be so pore ķat ķei ben so ioccupied to gete here 
liflode ķanne ķei mowe not a while to caste out aenst ķe tyrauntes 
and ķat tyrauntes nedeķ nout to haue warde 
by cause of ķe cely sogettes. 
And for a verray kyng desireķ profit of ķe sogettes, 
he greueth hem not noķer maÞeķ hem pore but fondeķ for to do hem good and profite. 
Pe eite cautel, 
a tyraunt procureth werrek, 
and sendeķ fittynge men 
to straunge contrées, 
and alwey to maÞe 
hem fite ķat ben in ķe regne so ķat ķei ben alwey ioccupied 
with charge of werre 
so ķat ķei mowe not a while to caste out aenst ķe tyraunt. 
And a verrey kyng greueķ 
not ķe sogettes meuynge werre and bataille, 
for he loueķ ķe comyn profit 
and wol not ķerfore ķat ķei ķat ben in ķe regne ta f. i worre 
but for deffence of ķe regne oķer for som ritful cause. 
Pe nynÞe is warde of his body 
not by hem ķat ben of ķe regne, 
for ķei tristen not on hem, 
but by strangers. 
And a verrey kyng doķ ķe con­ traríe 
as it is playnlich iseid tofore. 
Pe tenķe cautel of a tyraunt [is] whanne he haķ maad strif 
and partees in ķe regne, 
by oon partie he 
w o l destroye anoķer 
and departe ķe loue. 
A n d | a kyng doķ ķe contrarie 
and maÞeķ non diuysions and coi. 
partees in ķe regne. 
But gif ķere be dyuysions 
and parties ķerinne, 
he fondeķ to amende it. Chapter XI Aile ķe cautels of tyrantes 
ķat we reÞened in ķe chapitre tofore ķe philosofer reducte to foure, 
for tyrauntes desiren foure. First, 
ķat here sogettes be vnkonnynge. 
Pe seconde, ķat ķei be cowardes 
and feynt of herte. 
Pe ķridde, 
ķat noon of hem triste on oķer. 
Pe ferķe, 
ķat ķei ben so pore 
and so ouersette 
ķat ķei mowe not rise aenste tirauntes. 
To ķis foure aile ķe forseide ben redu[c]te. 
v Book III Part II 
For as it longeķ to ķis doynge gif 
eny man scholde arise oķer cast 
t aenst a tyraunt, 
it comeķ of oon of ķe forseide foure. 
A n d first, 
it may come of grete hert so ķat ķe riser is so gret of hert 
ķat he acounteķ 
no ķingges greet. 
Pe seconde, 
of wit and of sleyÞe so ķat he trowek to caste and deuyse 
so manye weyes and wiles 
ķat he may destroye ķe tyrant. 
Pe ķridde, 
it may come of myt and power so ķat ķe risere trowek and tristeķ 
in oķere citeseyns 
ķat ķei wolle helpe hym wik ciuel myt and power to rise 
and to destroye ķe tyraunt. 
P[e ferkle, 
it may come of gret idelnesse 
as gif citeseyns ben fui riche and ful idel; 
for ķe ķout of mankynde 
may not ben idel, 
whan citeseyns 
ben not ioccupied 
to gete here liflode Þey bythenÞen and casten 
in what wise ķei mowe maak partie 
and desturble ķe citee and rise aenst gouernours of citeseyns. 
Panne aenst ķis foure tyrantes fonden to destroye excellent men 
ķat Þeyre sogettes 
be not bold of herte; 
and fondeķ to destroye wyse men 
and lette scooles and studies ķat ķei ķat ļ 
ben in ķe regne ben f. io lewede and vnkonnynge; 
and suffreķ not companye and felowschipe among citeseyns 
for noon of hem scholde triste on oķer; 
and fondeķ to maÞe hem pore 
and to occupie hem 
in werre and in oķer doynge ķat ķei ben not idel. 
Pes ben ķe cautels of tyrauntes. 
But on caas no man is ful tiraunt, 
for euel destroyeth itself; 
and gif any were ful tyraunt, 
it mygt not be suffred 
as it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum. 
A n d on caas vnneķe oķere 
is eny ful kyng 
but he do som tiraundise; 
for gif a kyng dede no tyraundise, 
he were as it were an half god. 
Perfore it is ķat lordes 
hauen som what of cautels of tyrauntes 
and som what of good doyng of kynges. 
A n d ķe nere a lordschepe is to kyngdom 
and ķe ferķere fro tyrantdise, 
ķe better it is. 
A n d we wollen reÞene 
ķe worÞes of eiķer 
and discreuen cautels of eyÞer. 
For contraries isette nyg togeders 
ben ķe bettere iknowe, 
ķe worÞes of a kyng ben iknowe for best gif 
ķe contrarie worÞes 
of a tyraunt ben declared worst. 
A n d it is best iknowe ķat kynges scholde forsaÞe tiraundise, 
for ķe worste is more to forsakynge 
and ķe best is most to folowyng. Chapter XII Wittes of men ben [so] inclined to euel 
ķat it is ful good and profitable [in] ķe wey of J maners and Þewes 
to declare by manye weyes 
and to preue by manye resouns 
ķat euel and vices ben iuel and vile of hem­ self 
and to forsakyng, 
so who ķat is not inclined 
by oon wey may be brougt in 
by anoķer to forsaÞe euel. 
A n d after ķat we hauen declared ķat tiraundise 
is most to forsakynge of kynges and princes, 
we wollen preue ķat kynges and princes schjolde be most besiliche ware ķat ķei coi. r become not tirauntes 
for al corupcioun and wrong in oķere principates 
is holiche igadred in tyraundise. 
And as it is declared tofore, 
ķ[r]e principatees ben good and ķre euel. 
For it was iseid 
ķat gif oon is lord for ķe comyn profit, 
ķe principate is rigtful 
and is icleped regnum, a regne; 
and gif on is lord 
for his owne profit, 
ķe principate is euel 
and is icleped [tyraundise. 
A n d gif fewe ben lordes for ķei ben vertuous, 
ķe principate is rigtful 
and is icleped aristocracia 
oķer principate of good men. 
A n d gif ķei ben lordes not for ķei ben good 
but for ķei ben riche, 
ķe principate is euel 
and is icleped] elegarchia. 
A n d gif al ķe puple haķ ķe lordschipe and desireth ķe profit of al, 
boķe riche and of oķere, 
ķe principate is rigtful; 
and gif ķe puple doķ tiraundise and ouersetteķ riche men 
ķe principate is euel 
and is icleped democracia, 
and is to menyng wikÞede 
and euele principate of ķe puple. 
Panne tyraundise and wikÞed principate of riche men 
and euel lordschipe of ķe puple 
ben euel principates 
and euele rewelynges, 
but tiraundise is ķe worste principate. 
For as ķe philosofer preueķ, 
v Poleticorum, 
al ķe euel ķat 
is in euel principate 
of riche men oķer in euel lordschipe of ķe puple 
is hoolliche igedred in tyraundyse. 
A n d ķat is declared in ķis wise. 
For gif riche men hauen lordschipe wrongfulliche, 
as it longeķ to ķis doynge, 
ķei desiren ķre: moneye, lordliche likynge, 
and warde of body. 
Pei desiren moneye, 
for eche prince desireķ echyng of kyng 
by ķe whiche he is prince. 
Panne gif a man is prince 
for he is good and vertuous, 
he desireth bettere worÞes 
for to be ķe betre and ķe more vertuous; 
but gif he is prince for he is riche, 
ķat he may ķe bettere be prince 
ķei desiren echyng and gaderynge of richesse. 
Wherfore gif riche men ben | wron[g]fulliche lordes, 
ķei ben not princes 
for ķei ben f. goode 
but for ķei ben riche, 
and al here entent is to gaderi money. 
Also riche men ķat ben wrongfulliche princes 
desiren bodiliche likynge and sencible lust. 
For gif a man wol ougt for a certeyn cause, 
ķei wol more ķe cause - 
as gif a man wol haue a drenche for to haue heele, he desireķ more ķe heele ķan ķe drynche. 
Panne for comynliche men 
and nameliche men of euel 
w i l ordeynen money 
and richesse 
to bodilich likynge 
and to sencible lust, 
it folwek ķat riche men 
ķat ben wrongfulliche lordes 
and desiren not ķe comyn profit 
but money desir­ eķ bodilich likynge. 
Pe ķridde, riche men ķat ben princes 
in ķat wise 
ben most besy aboute Þepyng of ķe bodye. 
For no man forsaÞeķ ķe comyn profit 
and desireķ moneye and likyng 
but he greue ķe puple 
in manye manere wise, 
for suche oon pileķÞe citeseyns 
for to haue moneye; and for to haue likynge, 
he doķ Þe citeseyns wrong 
and despit in wyues and dougtres. 
Panne he knowek ķat he is ihated among ķe puple 
and tristeķ not to hem 
and is most besi to Þepe ķe body. V Book III Part II 
And al suche euel doynge in principate, 
ķat is to say lordschip 
ķat is in euel principate of riche men, 
is igedred in to tyraundise. 
For as it is iseid tofore, 
a tiraunt desireķ 
not ķe comyn profit but moneye. 
Also he desireķ not werschepful good 
but likynge good. 
Pe ķridde, 
a tyraunt is most besy aboute warde of his bodi, 
for he knowek ķat ķei hauen igreued many men. 
And it is irad of a tiraunt ķat was al day iblamed 
of his | owne brother col. 
for he was alway elynge and heuy and schewede neuere glad chere. 
A n d ķis tyraunt wolde 
maÞe his broÞer knowe ķe cause 
and let strype hym naÞed and honge ouer his heed 
a wel scherp swerd 
by a wel smale ķreed 
and made men stonde aboute hym 
with alblastres ibend and quarelles ķerinne. 
A n d whanne his brother 
was swyÞe sore aferd and dradde sore ķe swerde ķat heng 
ouer his heed 
and ķe alblastres 
ķat were ibent aboute hym, 
ķanne ķe tiraund seide, 
"BroÞer, 
be glad and schew good cheere." 
A n d he seide ķat he mygte not 
for he was in so greet perile. "Ne," iquod ķe tyraunt, 
"may I be glad, 
for I am in more peril; 
for I haue greued men 
in so manye manere wise ķat alwey I drede ķe deķ." 
Panne it is ful spedful 
to a kyng to be war ķat he bycome not a tyraunt, 
for tyrauntes leesen ķe lif 
withoute ende and hauen ķerto vnneķe oon good day in ķis world; 
for ķei knowen ķat ķei ben alwey in perel. 
Also tyrauntes hauen not so moche moneye as verrey kynges, 
for hem nedede to spende moche in veyn. 
And also verrey kynges ben lordes by loue 
and hauen more good by loue 
ķan tyrauntes hauen 
by spoylynge of Þe puple. 
For we hauen iknowe tyrantes 
ķat hauen ileued in more desese 
and nede ķan verrey kynges. 
Panne tyrauntes hauen not so moche bodiliche likynge as verrey kynges. 
For to haue manye frendes 
and be loued of ķe puple 
is most likyng, 
and trist in no man and trowe to be hated of ķe puple is most sorweful, 
ķanne a tyraunt is priued of most likyng for ķei knowen 
ķat he is hated of ķe puple. 
Hit I is iknowe ķat it nedeķ to be waar of tiraundise for ķe euele of f. i i an euel principate 
and [a principate of riche men 
is igedred ķerinne. 
Panne it is to knowe ķat it nedeķ to be waar of ķe] eueles of euel 
prin­ cipate of puple igedred ķerinne. 
For whanne ķe puple 
hauen principate wicÞedliche, 
ķei desiren not to saue eche man in his owne estaat, 
but Þey fonden to ouersette gentil men and noble and so doÞ a tyraunt. 
For as it is declared tofore, 
he fondeķ wik al his mygt 
to ouersette ex­ cellent men 
and to destroye and slee riche men, gentle and noble. 
Panne it is most nedful to kynges 
to be war of tyrandise 
in whiche ben so manye euele doynges igadered. 
r Chapter XIII 
For we maÞe ķis book 
for lore of kynges and of princes 
ķat Þei mowe ritfulliche and streit rewle ķe puple 
ķat is vnder hem, 
for leuyng ritful rewelyng is ido tiraundise and wrong to sogettes 
and not desire ķe comyn profit. 
Pei we haue declared 
by manye weyes by Þynges 
Þat ben iseid 
Þat it is euel 
and perelous 
to a kyng to do tiraundise 
and rewle not 
Þe puple arit, 
ut it slewthek vs not to brynge 
ne we resouns to preue ķe same. 
And we wollen declare in ķis chapitre 
ķat for manye causes sogettes arisen aenst tirauntes, 
and for tyrauntes lif was ful perelous and leuynge of ritful rewelyng, 
ķerfore kynges scholde besiliche Studie 
ķat ķei forsaÞe not ritful rewelynge 
noķer do tyraundise. 
And, V Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer reÞeneķ sex causes 
w h i sogettes risen aenst tyrauntes. 
Pe firste is for drede. 
For manye ben feynt hertede, 
and whanne ķei dreden to moche and trowen not to scape 
and ben in | wanhope, 
a j reseķ ķerfore 
in oķere men 
and ben imaad col. bolde men and hardye. 
Perfore it is iseid 
in a prouerbe ķat he ķat chaseķ to swyÞe a ferful man 
maÞen hem hardy. 
A n d so oķere bestes comonliche dreden man; 
and but ķei trowede ķat man 
wolde do hem 
harm,Þei wolde seide oķer neuere rese on man. 
Pan comonlich for drede bestes liggen in awayte on man and reseķ on hem, 
and ofte in ķis wise sogettes 
arisen aenst ķe tyrant and sleek hym dredyng ķat he wol do hem harme. 
Pe seconde cause wherfore sogettes risen aenst ķe tiraunt 
is for to be 
wroÞe of ķe wrong 
ķat he doķ hem, 
for it is kyndeliche to desire wreche. 
Perfore Omerus seide ķat wreche 
is swettere ķan hony, 
for it is desire of peyne for wreche. 
Panne for it is likynge in ķat wise to desire wreche, 
manye arysen aenste a tyraunt and reseķ on hym som tyme for strong wrathe to be wroÞe of wronges ķat he doķ. 
Pe ķridde, 
som men arisen aenst a tyraunt 
and sleeth hym som tyme, 
for comynliche tyrauntes don kynges 
wherfore ķei ben despised. 
For Þei desiren not Þe comyn profit 
but bodilich likynge, 
comynliche ķei ben not sobre but glotons 
and not chaast but lechours 
and ben ķerfore despised 
and sone men risen o n hem. 
Here of w e hauen ensaumple 
as ķe philosofer reherseth, 
v Poleticorum, 
of oon Sardanapallus 
and of anoķer Dionysius. 
For Sardanapallus forsook ķe comyn profit 
and af hym al to lecherie. 
And a certeyn duk despisede hym for his bestial lif and resede on hym | and sclow hym. 
A n d so Dionisius f. 
was a tyrant and tolde more pris of glotonye ķanne of Þe comyn profit 
and was despised of sogetes, 
for he was as ķei 
he were alwey dronÞe. 
A n d oon Dyon sei hym 
as it were dronÞe alwey 
and hadde despit of hym 
and roos aenst hym. 
v Book III Part II 
Pe ferķe, 
men risen agenst a tyraunt 
for to haue worschep and wynnynge. 
For worschep and honour is acounted most good 
among out­ ward good, manye, seynge ķat a tyrant loue [ o n l i c h e h i s o w n e h o n o u r 
and worschep and h o n o u r 
n o t h i s sogettes and l o u e ] not ķe comyne profit and desireķ 
to haue honour and worschep 
as ķei seen 
ķat ķe tiraunt haķ, 
a reseķ on hym and sleek hym. 
Also manye men acounteķ money most good, 
and seek ķat ķe tiraunt desireķ 
not but his owne wynyng and gaderyng of moneye and reseķ 
on hym and taÞeķ his tresour. Perfore, v Poleticorum, 
it is iseid ķat som men reseķ 
on tirauntes seyng ķat ķei hauen greet wynnynge and werschep. 
Pe fifķe, 
som men arisen agenst tirauntes not for to haue ķe princi­ pate 
but for to be holde men of singuler dedes. 
For som men wolde haue a greet name and doķ ķerfore 
som wonderful and singuler dede. 
And for ķei acounten risynge agenste

Pe sexte,

For ķese causes men risen agenst a tiraunt. 
Panne for no risynge scholde be agenst a kyng

ķei scholde most besiliche be waar ķat he bycome not a tyrant. 
For gif he doķ sogettes non wrong, 
he is continent and sobre and lyuek not bestial lyf ķat is to despisyng; 
he werschepek gentel men and oķere ķat ben in ķe regne as heere astaat axek; 
ķei spoylen hem not noķer ouersetten hem, 
but he bereķ hym 
in alle thinges 
not as a tyraunt 
but as a verrey kyng; 
and maÞeķ al men ķat ben in ķe regne louye hym 
and bynemen hem al malice and cause w h i ķei scholde rise agenste hym. Chapter XIV 
Theyg we haue itaugt kynges and princes in manye chapitres 
tofore ķat ķei do not tyrandise 
but ķat ķei rewle here puple arigt, 
gut in ķis chapitre 
we w o l brynge fork 
oķere resons to preue ķat gif kynges de­ siren 
ķat here lordschepe dure, 
ķei scholde be bysyliche waar ķat ķei bicorne not tyrauntes. 
For tyraundise and euel principate 
is destroyed in mo diuers maneres ķan a rigtful principate of a verrey kyng. 
A n d , v Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer reÞeneķ ķre maners of destroynge of tyrauntes, 
and seith ķat tyraundise destroyek [itself, 
and on tyraundise destroyek] anoķer, 
and a regne destroyek t[i]raundise. 
Tiraundise destroyek itself. 
For as it is iseid tofore, 
euel destroyeth itself; 
and gif it is hool, 
it may not be suffred. 
And for wykÞednesse 
and euel ķat is igadred in tyrantdise it may not longe dure. 
Perfore it is iseid in Poleticis 
Þat ķe grettere ķe tyraundise is, 
ķe lasse tyme it dureķ, 
for rigtwisnesse saueķ citées and principate. 
Wherfore whanne rigtwisnesse is forsaÞe, 
a wey is imaade 
to destroye ķat principate. 
Panne ķe more a polocie and ordenaunce 
forsaÞeķ rigtwisnesse, 
ķe sonere of it I self it is destroyed. 
Panne gif kynges and princes 
w o l ķat here 
f. i lordschepe dure, 
ķei scholde be bisiliche war 
ķat ķei forsaÞe not rigtwisnesse 
noķer go out of ķe wey noķer bycome tyrauntes. 
And gif it happeķ in eny wise Þat Þei doun tirauntdise, 
ķei mote abate tiraundise 
with al here mygt. 
For Þe lasse Þe tyraundise is, 
ķe more durable is ķe principate. [Pe seconde], 
on tiraundise destroyek anoķer ķat is contrarie ķerto; 
for ķei good be not contrarie to good 
for it is good in [on] wise, 
gut euel may be contrarie to euel 
for euel is in many maner wise. 
For a man may hit ķe mark 
but in on maner wise, 
and ķerfore ķerinne 
is noon euel noķer contrarienesse. 
But he may fayle of ķe mark 
in manye maner wise; 
wherfore faylynges may be contrarie, as gif ķe schot 
is to long oķer to schort. 
A n d so a schot ouer ķe marÞe 
is contrarie to a schot 
Þat comeķ not fulliche to ķe marÞe, 
and a schot to fere in ķe on side 
is contrarie to a schot in Þe oķer side. 
A n d so in oure purpos 
oo rigtful principate 
is not contrarie 
to anoķer rigtful principate, 
but a wrongful principate 
is contrarie 
to anoķer principate wrongful. 
Panne on tyraun­ dise 
may be contrarie 
to anoķer tiraundise and destroye it, 
as tiraundise of ķe puple 
is contrarie to tyraundise of an euel prince [and on euel prince] 
is contrarie to ķe tirandise of anoķer euel prince. 
For whanne oon prince oķer anoķer ķat is prince alone doun tyrandise on ķe puple, 
[ķe puple] ķat is ouersette 
w o l not be ouer[sette] 
of suche a prince 
[and] wolle rysen agenst hym % 
and don tyraundise agenste hym and putteķ hym out and sleeth hym. 
Panne is al ķe puple imaad 
as ķei it were oo tyraunt, 
wherfore | principate and tyraundise col. 
of ķe puple destroyen tyraundise of a prince. 
A n d also tyraundise of a prince 
distroyeth tirandise of anoķer prince. 
For of te on prince is a tirant 
and riseķ agenst another tirant 
and bynemek hym his princi­ pate. 
Panne kynges and princes scholde be besiliche 
iwar ķat ķei do no tyraundise, 
for principate of tyraundise 
is destroyed 
in so manye manere wise. 
Pe ķridde, tiraundise is distroyed not oonliche by itself oķer by oķer tyrandise 
but also by a regne. 
For not onliche euel 
is contraríe to euel, 
but also good is contrarie to euel; 
and <nogt> onliche a tiraunt 
is contrarie to a tyraunt, 
but also a kyng riseķ agenst 
a tyrant gif he seek ķat it is to doynge. 
Panne a tyraunt is in so manye manere periles 
and his principate is destroyed 
in so manye manere wise. 
And lordschipe of a kyng 
is not in so many perels 
noķer is distroyed in so mani maner wise. 
For ķeig a tirant fonde wiÞ al his mygt 
to ouersette a verrey kyng, 
git no verrey r Book III Part II kyng [greueķ a verrey kyng]; 
for no good man and vertuous pursewek 
oķer good men and vertuos 
but saueķ hym 
and helpeķ 
with al his mygt. 
For gif enny gode men 
oķer vertuos greuede good men and vertuos ķan he leueķ to be good and vertuos. 
Panne a kyng scholde be besilich iware of tyrandise leste he fal in to ķe forsaide perels. Chapter XV Qvynto Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer toucheķ x ķat saueķ polecie, wisdom, and ordinance 
and ķat a kyng mote do Þepe hymself 
in his regne oķer principate. 
Pe firste, 
he schal not suffre smale trespaces in his regne, 
for [many smale trespasses, 
as ķe philosofer seiķ, 
maÞen oon greet, 
as] many smale costes m[aÞen] 
thereto oon greet cost. 
For many smale trespasses disposen, 
ķat is to say m[a]Þen redy, 
to grete trespasse. (For ķe grettest trespace of al is to defiende God 
and his lordschipe to grete trespasse.) | f. i He ķat reccheķ 
not of ķe leste falleķ litel and litel in to ķe moste. 
Panne ķe principies 
scholde be wikstonde and wronges 
scholde be forbode ķei it were for [Alte. 
Pe seconde ķat saueķ policie, wisdome, 
in rewelyng of kynges 
is wel doynge to hem ķat ben in ķe regne, 
bryngynge hem to som princi­ pate 
and do hem worschepe and no wrong. 
For as ķe philosofer seith in Politicis doynge good 
to citeseyns not onliche saueķ ritful policie (wisdome), 
but also Þerby ķe principate 
is ķe more durable ķei som wrong be medled ķerinne. 
Pe ķridde, 
for to maÞe hem aferd 
ķat ben in policie (wisdome); 
for harme ķat is f[e]r in dede and ni in drede saueķ policie (wisdome). 
For citeseyns ben ķe more söget and obedient to ķe prince gif ķei dreden harme of straungers, 
for outward werre aleyķ inward strif 
and maÞeķ citeseyns ķe more acorded. 
Herof we hauen ensample of ķe Romayns. 
For whanne hem failede outward werre, 
ķei bygunne to haue werre among hemself. 
A n d ķis cautel 
is profitable onliche to twey pryncipates: 
to a principate [ķat] is imade of men 
ķat ben ivsed to werre, 
and to a principate in ķe whiche 
on bygynnek newliche to regne. 
For men ķat ben ivsed to werre 
and reccheķ not of oķere vertues 
but onliche of fortitudo, staleworknesse, 
ben by ķe philosofres, 
vii Polet­ icorum, 
ilikned to ire ķat is cleer and bryt 
while it is ivsede | 
and rusteķ col. 
gif it be not ivsed. 
And so [s]oche fityng men ben obedient to ķe prince 
while ķei vsen werre, 
and konneķ not haue hemself 
in Þew manere gif ķei l[e]uen werre. Panne alwey me schal maÞe suche aferd of werre 
and of harme of straungers. 
Also gif oon bygynnek neweliche to be prince, 
me w o l arise sone agenst suche a prince. 
Panne leste citeseyns arise agenste ķe prince, 
and also for to be ķe more acorded 
to be obedient to ķe prince, 
me v scholde maÞe hem aferd of perels of straungers. 
But gif ķe regne haķ longe istonde in pees 
and gif ķat lord 
is kyndelich lord 
so ķat it is as it were out of mynde 
whan his forfadres 
bygonne to regne, 
ķan ķe forsaide cautel is litel work. 
Pe ferķe ķat saueķ polecie, wisdome, 
is for to be waar of rysynges 
and strif of gentil men and noble; 
and ķat geuyng to hem lawes, 
for lawes ben not sone withseide. 
A n d suche lawes scholde be maad in a regne 
by ķe whiche strif of gentil men 
mygt be assaied; 
for gif barouns stryuen, 
ķan ķer ben parties imaad in ķe regne, 
and so is a way imaad 
to destroye ķe principate of ķe kyng. 
Pe fifte is takyng besiliche heede how ķei beren hemself 
ķat ķe kyng haķ ķe worschepe 
and avaunsede to som greet office oķer to som principate. 
For no thing so Þepeķ and saueķ polecie 
as for to avaunse good men 
and vertuous 
and geue hem lordschepe and principate. 
Wherfore most sauacioun of polecie, wisdome, 
is gif Þe kyng 
taÞeķ besiliche heede 
wha[m] he avaunceķ and setteķ 
in greet office and dignité: 
and gif ķei doun wel, 
maÞe hem grettere lordes; 
and gif ķei doun euel, 
maÞe here lordschepe lasse. 
A n d ķei mygte do so geuele ķat ķei scholde lese al here lordschepe 
and on caas here lyf also. 
Pe sixte is for | to geue no man to swithe gret lordschipe. 
For grete f. lordschipe of greet goodnesse of fortune corrumpeķ comynliche menne hertes 
and maÞen hem trespasse agenst rigtwisenesse. 
And ķis cautel is most profitable touchinge men ķe whiche ķe kyng haķ not assayed 
and iknowe longe tyme. 
Perfore it is most nede to be waar ķat no man be sodeynliche isette vp in Þe gretteste principate. 
Pe seuenķe ķat saueķ polecie, wisdome, 
and regne is gif 
Þe kyng oķer Þe prince louede Þe comyn profit of ķe regne 
and Þe polecie (wisdome) 
in ķe whiche he is prince. 
For eche man [Þat] loueķ is besi and dredeķ lest eny thyng falle amys in kyng ķat he loueķ. 
A n d drede maÞeķ 
men to haue good counsaile 
as it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum. 
For where many counsaills ben, 
ķere is greet sauacioun. 
Wherfore gif ķe kyng loueķ 
Þe comyn profit of Þe regne, 
Þe regne schal be saued. 
For dredynge euel ķat mygte falle in ķe regne, 
he w o l haue manye counsaylles 
in what wise he may helpe Þe comyn profit of ķe regne 
and wikstonde perils ķat mygte befalle. 
Pe eigtķe ķat saueķ ķe regne 
and polecie is cyuel mygt and powere. For as it is iseid in Magnis Moralibus, 
rigtwisnesse saueķ citées and comyntees. 
But rigtwisnesse in a regne 
may not be saued 
but ķei ķat trespassen agenst rigtwisnesse be ponesched 
by laweful mygt and 
powere.if a kyng oķer a prince wol 
saue rigtwisnesse and ponysche hem 
Þat trespassen, 
Þei scholde haue manye spies 
to spie and waite dedes of citeseyns, 
where Þei hauen Þat Þei spenden, 
and | how Þey col. 
mowe geue reÞenynge of here liflode. 
For he ķat may not geue suche reÞenyng 
it is a toÞene ķat he lyuek 
by ķefte oķer 
by euel gete good. r Book III Part II 
And in ķis wise he may saue rigtwisnesse and Þepe 
and saue ķe regne 
fro euele doers and fro men ķat trespassen agenst rigtwisnesse. 
Pe nynÞe ķat saueķ ķe regne 
is a good kyng and vertuous. 
For as it is iseid, 
v Poleticorum, 
more vertue nedeķ 
in Þepyng of citee and regne ķan 
in a duk of an oste. 
[ F o r a d u k o f a n oste] 
nedeķ principalliche experience and assay; 
but ķe wardeyn of citee 
and of regne mot be vertuous and epeiÞes, 
ķat is to menyng passyng rigtful. 
For suche on schal be 
as it were an half god; 
for as he passeķ oķere men in dignité and in mygt, 
so Þey scholde passe hem in goodnesse. 
A n d ķis schal īo most saue ķe regne and polecie gif ķe kyng is good and vertuous, 
for ķanne he loueķ most ķe comyn profit of ķe regne. 
Pe tenķe is ķat ķe kyng knowe ķe polecie 
by ķe whiche he is prince 
and what may destroye Þat wisdome 
and what may saue it. 
A n d suche thinges 
may best be iknowe 
by experience and assaye. 
For whanne a man haķ longe assayed 
and iknowe ķe nedes of ķe regne, 
it may be sone iknowe what saueķ 
Þe good staat of ķe regne 
and what destroyek it. 
Panne a kyng scholde ofte 
byÞenÞe and haue mynde of kynges 
Þat were idoun in ķe regne 
in olde tyme 
and how it was irewled 
in olde tyme 
and how ķe good state of ķe regne 
was best isaued in olde tyme 
that he may knowe 
how he scholde be prince 
and what destroyek oÞer saueķ ķe regne 
in ķe rewelynge ķerof. 
But suche kynges | may be f. knowe ķe regne

It is iseid tofore ķat foure scholde be knowe 
in rewelyng of a citee ķe prince,

Panne after ķat we hauen 
by helpe of G 
o d termyned of ķe prynce and distyngwed 
h o w manye maner principates ķer ben, 
and whiche ķerof ben rigtful 
and whiche wrongful, 
and declared Þat a regne 
is best principate 
and tiraundise worst principate, 
and declared what is Þe office of a kyng 
and what hym nedeķ for to do for to rewle his puple arigt: 
f ķ e ķriddef, 
we preuede with manye resons 
ķat a kyng scholde be bysiliche ware 
ķat he bycomek not a tyraunt, 
and as it longeķ to ķis doynge,

atte fülle kynges

Panne it is to tretynge of counsaile 
and of kynges ķat scholde be treted touchynge counsaille. 
But for Þe philosofer,

Kind Kind First, 
al kyng Þat is inmutable

For we taÞen consaille

in oure dedes and nedes 
and for to voide euel 
and for | to haue good. 
Pan kynges ķat may a not ben voided and kynges ķat may not be changed falleķ not vnder counsaille. 
Perfore, iii Ethicorum, 
it is iseid ķat of euere lastynge kynges

for kynges ķat meueķ alwey

For of kynges ķat ben necessarie and nedful

but of kynges ķat may be indifferentliche come

Perfore it is iseid, 
iii Ethicorum, 
Þat of kynges ķat ben alwey

For Þei Þe sierres meue,

A n d gif any counsaille schulde be taÞe of suche doyng,

Perfore of rayn ķat falleķ ofte

for no kyng ķat we desiren fynaliche to haue 
by oure owne 
worÞes fallen vnder counsaile, 
for consaille is not of ķe ende 
but of menés to come to ķe ende. 
For in counsaille it nedeķ to suppose a fynal ende 
ķat is fynaliche desired 
and not taÞe counsaille

but of menés 
by Þe whiche we may come to Þat ende. 
A fisycian desireķ fynalliche heele

But he taÞeķ for certayne ķat Þe siÞe scholde be heled

Panne counsaille

Eche counsaile

he Þat taÞeķ counsaile 
wel oÞer euel axek 
som what for to maÞe resons. 
Perfore eche man 
Þat consaileķ axek, 
but not agenward. 
For as it is iseide, iii Ethicorum, 
ķei eche consail be a questioun, 
gut not eche questioun 
is a counsaile. 
For gif consaille 
is itaÞe onliche of thinges 
ķat stonden in oure dedes, 
consaille is a questioun 
not of alle thinges 
but oo[n]liche of doynge 
and dedes of mankynde. 
Of spéculatif thinges

and of oķere thinges of kynde 
Þat may not chaunge

doynge and dedes of mankynde 
ben icleped agibilia. 
Hit is declared what is counsaile, 
for counsaile is a questioun of doynge 
and dedes of mankynde. 
And it is to wetynge 
in what wise consaile scholde be itaÞe 
and what maner doyng we scholde haue ķerinne. 
And as it longeķ to ķis doynge 
for to wite 
how counsaile scholde be taÞe,

Pe firste is ķe more a kyng is in certeyn, 
ķe lasse it nedeķ to haue counsaile ķerof; 
and if it is al in certeyne, 
ķanne nedeķ no counsaille. 
Perfore it is iseid, 
iii Ethicorum, 
ķat of certayn 
worÞes of lore is no counsaille; 
as of lettres ķe writere 
taÞeķ no counsail 
but he be al vnkunnynge 
how Þey scholde write ķe letters, 
for he knowek ķat wel by craft of writynge. 
Panne counsaille is itaÞe of kynges 
ķat we may do 
and ben not al certeyn 
how ķei scholde be do; 
ķerfore we | douten and col. 
taÞen counsaille ķerof. 
A n d it is ivsed in consaille takynge 
Þat whan eny nede of ķe regne [is] ipurposed,

and ķe lees certeyne weyes it hath, 
ķe more it nedeķ to taÞe counsaile 
for to chese ķe beste of kylÞe weyes. Pe seconde, 
it is to knowynge 
ķat in consaille we scholde not axe consaile 
of al smale thinges 
but of grete thinges. 
For as is iseid tofore ķat drede maÞeķ men taÞe counsaille, 
ķanne it semeķ 
ķat he ķat taÞeķ counsaile dredeķ and douteķ leste he faile 
by som happe of ķe beste good oķer leste he haue som damage oķer euel. 
Panne consaile scholde not be taÞe of ful smale thinges 
of ķe whiche comeķ 
but litel good oķer lette of litel harme. 
Panne in counsaile ķe manere scholde be knowe ķat we scholde taÞe consaile of grete thinges. 
Pe ķridde, 
whanne we wolle taÞe counsaile, 
we schal taÞe oķere men to vs and trete ķe mater among hem. 
For Þey a man myte 
of his owne wit fynde weyes and maners 
to do wel and wiseliche in certeyne dedes, 
it he is vnwise ķat tristeķ 
al to his owne witt 
[and] he w o l not huyre menynge of oķere men. 
For in consailles ķis is a greet wisdome 
for to trete wik oķere men 
ķat is to doynge, 
and ķis may be declared by twey weyes. 
For as it is iseide tofore, 
counsaile scholde be of grete thinges; 
and in suche kynges eche man scholde clepe oķere men 
to counsaile wetynge 
ķat manye men 
mowe knowe moo kynges ķan on man may knowe. 
Wherfore it is iseid, 
iii Ethicorum, 
ķat we taÞen counsaillours in grete thinges, 
as it were |vntrowynge| 
ķat we be not | 
f. siffisaunt to deme arit. 
Also ķe same is declared for consaile 
is of particular doynge, 
and ķerinne experience is moche worth. 
For as it is r Book III Part II iseid, primo Methaphisicorum, 
in suche doynges he ķat is expert 
and haķ asayed doķ more profit ķanne a craftes man. 
Panne for manye men 
ben more expert 
and hauen more assaied ķan on man alone, 
to suche doyng oķere men schulde be cleped ķat ķe beste wey may be chose 
by here counsaille. 
A n d what counsaillours scholde be cleped it schal be declared in ķe processe. 
Pe ferķe, 
it is to wetynge what is iseid in counsaille scholde be prevey. 
For manye nedes ben ilett 
by wriyng and tellyng out of coun­ saille. 
A n d on caas counsaille 
haķ ķerfore ķis name consilium, 
for som men wolde mené ķat concilium 
is al oon for in counsaille many sitteķ togeders. 
But on caas we may bettere saye ķat ķis name consilium 
is componed of con ķat 
is to menyng togeders, 
and of silio, siles, ķat is to menynge be stille in scilence. 
So ķat consilium 
ķat is consaille scholde be what manye men knowen 
and ben stille and speÞeķ not ķerof. 
A n d in consaile ķis doynge scholde be most iholde, 
and nameliche whan comune nedes and doynge of ķe regne ben itreted, 
so ķat eche consaillour forsaÞeķ 
Þe doynge of singuler profit 
and haue eye onliche to ķe comyn profit. 
A n d what is iseide 
in suche counsaille scholde be preuey 
for profit 
of ķe regne scholde not be lett. 
For among ķe Romayns trouķe of consaillours eched ķe empire 
and ķe lordschipe, 
for ķei were so preuei ķat al ķat ķei herde 
was as preuey as thei had neuer iherd. Perof | Valerius Maximus, 
ii libro De Factis Memorialibus, col. capitulo De Institutis Antiquis, 
preysek Þe consaillours of Rome and seiķ Þat Þe preuey consistorie of ķe empire was trewe and IÍ and iwarded wik stille and preuey helfulnesse; 
and Þei Þat come in to ķe tligtf ķerof forsoÞe 
priuat loue and louede so 
ķe comyne profit so 
ķat I schal not seye ķat [n]oon 
but ķat oon herde trowynge 
Þat manye men hurde. 
Pe fifte, 
in counsaile it is to wetynge 
Þat me scholde not speÞe plesynge wordes 
but sothe and trewe. 
For whanne flaterers fonden to plese ķe kyng oķer prince, 
ķei sparen ķe sothe and trewÞe and speÞen flateryng wordes and putten al ķe principate 
and regne in peril. 
Perfore a wis man ķat heet Aristides seide ķat counsailours 
scholde haue twey condiciouns 
so ķat ķei scholde not be playne 
and telle out counsaille, 
noķer flaterers and more charge 
to speÞe plesynge wordes 
ķan soÞe wordes and trewe. 
Also as ķe philosofer reherseth, 
iii Rethoricorum, 
a poet ķat heet Alexander seyg in counsailles 
ķat oon was preuey 
and soķ seggere and preysede hym and saide, 
"ķis is a 
counsaillour,"as ķei he w o l mené in comparisoun to hym 
Þe oķere scholde not be cleped counsaillours but on caas flaterers. 
Pe sexte is ķat in counsaille 
it is to doynge ķat men taÞe counsaile 
to do in dede anoon 
as it is icounsailled 
gif it is good tyme. 
For gif it is good tyme of doyng, 
gif we wille to do arit 
a certeyne dede 
and we doun it nout, 
ķat is for we knowen not 
whether it be spedful oķer no. 
Panne it is wel idoo 
to trete besiliche 
a grete dede wheÞer | it be to f. doynge oķer no. 
But after ķat it is wel iknowe 
by longe consaile what is to doynge, 
it scholde be doun anoon gif ķer is good tyme of doynge. 
Panne it is wel iseid, 
vi Ethicorum, 
ķat we counsaillen longe tyme and worchek anoun, 
and ķat it nedeķ 
to consaille slowliche and to do and werche swyftliche 
as ķe consaille demeķ. 
v Chapter XVIII 
Aile ķat he scholde haue in [se]mynge 
ķat maÞeķ good euydences and persuasions 
and is wel itrowed, 
a good counsaillour scholde haue in dede. 
For by cause a man maÞeķ good euedences 
in counsailes 
and is itrowed, 
for he is iholde a good counsaillour 
to maÞe good euedences. 
But ķeig a man be holde good and wel to trowynge, 
it nedeķ not ķat he be suche on in dede; 
but it is inow 
ķat he be holde suche on, 
for man demeķ what he knowek outward 
by ķe skylful euedences. 
Perfore man haķ suffisaunt euydence 
and fey by oon 
ķat is wel to trowynge 
gif he holde hym a good counsaillour. 
But for to be a good consaillour 
it is not inow to seme suche oon, 
but it nedeķ ķat he be suche oon in dede. 
Panne it is wel iseid 
ķat eche ķat maÞeķ euedences 
and hath a good consaillour in semyng mot haue suche oon in dede. 
Wherfore gif we wolle knowe what consaillours 
a kyng scholde haue 
and what thinges 
and how manye ben nedful in counsaille, 
it is spedful to knowe 
in how manye manere wise per­ suasions and euedences 
ben imaad to meue men 
to trowe wordes 
ķat ķei hyren. 
A n d ķes ben ķre 
as in eche speche mote be ķre - ķei ķat speÞen, 
and ķe auditoure | 
to wham Þey speÞen, 
and ķe kyng of ķe col. 
which ķe speche is. 
And first, 
it may be ķat ķe auditour haķ euydence 
and is imeued to trowe wordes 
ķat he ahireķ 
by cause of hym ķat speÞeķ, 
and Þat is 'gif he~ ķat aspeÞeķ is good oķere iholde good. 
For good men ben itrowed 
ķoug ķei conne maÞe non resouns. 
But suche fey and trowyng comeķ 
of hym Þat speÞeķ, 
for by cause ķat men ben good 
and wollen not lye 
Þei ben sone itrowed. 
Pe seconde, 
auditours mowe by hemself 
haue suche fey and trowyng and ķat may be gif he ķat speÞeķ 
is goodliche and frend, 
and nameliche iholde goodliche and frend. 
For as men ben comynlich disceyued of hemself, 
trowyng ķat ķei ben more worthi and more wis Þan Þei ben, 
and comynliche in nedes 
and causes men trowen ķat ķei seen more ķan ķei seen 
and ķat ķei speÞen more to purpos Þan Þei don, 
so for a man is iholde a frend, 
comynliche men ben disceyued of frendes. 
For as it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
louynge and hatynge demeķ diuerseliche, 
for comynliche we demen good of dedes of frendes 
and euel dedes of enemyes. 
For we ben passionate touchinge oure frendes r l Book III Part II 
as we ben touchinge vsself so ķat we trowen Þat Þei ben bettere and more worth Þan Þei ben. 
Wherfore gif auditours trowen goodliche men and frendes and men 
Þat ben suche iholde, 
suche trowynge comeķ of Þe silf auditours 
to Þe whiche Þe speche is imaad 
and ben passionate of hemself 
and inclined 
to trowe hemÞat ben frendes. 
Pe ķridde trowynge comeķ 
of ķe selue thinges, 
and ķat is gif ķe speÞere 
is wise oķer iholde wis, 
for a | wise man knowek ķe thinges 
f. i and nedes and causes. 
For it is iseid, primo Ethicorum, 
ķat eche man demeķ wel of kynges ķat he knowek. 
Panne of nedes and kynges ķat a wise man speÞeķ of comeķ fey and trowynge, 
and ķis trowynge and persuasioun is of itself. 
For gif a man maÞeķ hymself wel itrowed 
and maÞeķ good euydence by hymself, 
it comeķ of kynges and nedes of ķe whiche he speÞeķ 
and cunnynge of mankynde of resouns 
and of argu­ mentes 
by ķe whiche auditours 
ben imeued to trowynge. 
A n d for wise men 
conneķ do so 
and it is itrowed 
ķat ķei ķat ben iholde wise cunneķ do so, 
ķerfore gif a man maÞeķ trowynge by thinges 
ķat ķei speÞen of, [oķer he] mot be wise oķer iholde wis. 
Panne eche Þat maÞeķ wel euedences 
and is wel itrowed mot be good oķer a frend oķer wise ķeig 
he be not so in dede 
but iholde such oon. 
Also it is iseid 
Þat Þynges 
Þat he Þat maÞeķ good euedences 
and is itrowed scholde haue in semynge, 
a good consaillour scholde haue in dede. 
It is declared atte fülle what manere consaillours 
a kyng scholde haue, 
for ķei scholde haue consaillours 
ķat ben good frendes and wise. 
For gif ķei ben good, 
a J lyeth not 
by cause of hemsilf, for good men haten al euel 
and al ķat is to hatynge; 
for as it is seid, 
iiii Ethicorum, 
lesynge is euel of itself 
and is to hatynge. 
Pe seconde, consaillours scholde not be oonliche good 
but also frendes; 
and so not onliche % ķei lyen not by cause of hem ķat speÞeķ and geueķ counsaille, 
[but also by cause of hym ķat ķei speÞeķ 
to and geueķ counsaille]: 
for frendes consailleķ 
frendes good and trowk | 
wik al here mygt. 
Pe ķridde, 
con- col. saillours schulde be wyse, 
for ķei lien not of thinges 
ķat ķei speÞen of but knowen ķe nedes ķat ben to doynge and weten how it scholde be do. 
Panne ķes ķre ben nedful in counsailours: goodnesse, frendschepe [and wisdome]. 
For to counsaile arigt, 
as it is iseid, 
ķei scholde be good frendes and wise. Chapter XIX öif ķe philosofres wordes, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
ben iknowe, 
of fyue men taÞen counsaile: 
of rente and payementes, 
of food, of warde of citées, 
of pees and of werre, 
of geuynge of lawe. 
Touchynge this fyue, 
consaillours mot be wis and cunnynge. 
r For first consaille is of paiement and fongyng 
in ķe whiche tweyne most be knowe. First, 
ķat ķe kyng taÞe no payementes wrongfulliche 
of his citeseyns, 
for it is ipreuede tofore ķat a kyng scholde be good and vertuous and avaunce and werschepe hem 
ķat ben in ķe regne and loue policye. 
A n d Þat may not be gif ķei bynemen hem here good wrongfulliche. 
Also it is to wetynge 
and to be waar ķat ķe kyng 
be not deceyued 
in payment and fongynge. 
For it is spedful ķat ķe kynges counsaille 
saue his rigt wik al here mygt, 
for suche good is iordeyned 
for ķe comyn profit 
and for ķe defence of ķe regne and for ķe good astaat ķerof. 
Panne consaillours scholde knowe rentes, prouentes, profites, and paymentes of ķe regne ķat scholde come to ķe kyng, 
what payement and how greet, 
so ķat gif eny payement 
is to moche and wrongfulliche itaÞe, 
it scholde be abated; 
and gif it is to litel 
and | to f. uc scarse, 
it sholde be ieched and imaad more. 
Pe seconde consaile is of foode. 
For to knowe gif a citee oķer a regne ķat haķ a prince and a rector be suffisaunt to itself 
in vitailes 
and in seruantes 
to suffisaunt leuynge, me scholde taÞe heede what store of vittailles 
is in ķe regne 
and in eche citee ķerof, 
and how moche may be b[r]ougt ķerto, 
and how and by wham 
it may be brougt ķerto, 
so ķat goode counsaile and good ordinaunce 
may be maad in ķis mater. 
Hit is not to takyng litel heede of vitailles 
so ķat eche citee haue suffisaunt lyuynge, 
for elles it were not a cite. 
A n d also in suche thinges 
ķat ben suffisaunt to ķe lif 
scholde be chaunge and byggynge and sellynge. 
Also it is to takynge hede of mesures and wigtes of sellers; 
and whanne it is spedful, 
ķe prise of sellynge scholde be taxed gif sellers wolde selle derrere ķan ķei scholde. 
Pe ķridde counsaille scholde be of warde 
and Þepynge of citee and of regne, 
and ķat in twey maner wise. 
For ķe firste nedeķ warde and Þepynge 
ķat strif and risyng 
and euel doynge arise not ķerinne. 
Perfore it is besiliche 
to takynge heede whiche citeseyns ben iholde goode 
and whiche euel, 
so ķat ķe euel scholde be besiliche aspied and awayted. 
And gif Þei ben itaÞe wik euel doynge, 
Þei scholde be iponysched oķer ido to deķe; 
for kynges and princes scholde not suffry passyng euel doers alyue. 
Also ķe place scholde be aspied in ķe whiche Þei vsen most to do harme. 
For as som men don more harme ķan oķere, 
so som places ben more accordyng 
to do harme inne ķan oķere. 
As in a citee sum stretes | col. 
ben more suspecte ķan oķere 
and ķerinne euele doers 
mowe betere be hid 
and ascape hym Þat pursewen hem. 
Also withoute citées ben wodes 
and places with schadewes more accordyng ķan oķere to do harm inne. 
Panne counsaille scholde be taÞe ķat suche place scholde be wel iÞepte. 
Also in Þepynge of citee 
and of regne consaile scholde be taÞe not oonliche for citeseyns 
and for hem ķat ben in ķe regne lest oon do Book III Part II oķer wrong, 
but also for straungers. 
For it is to takynge heede [gi]f ķe regne 
in eny side 
mygte be ouersette wik enemyes, 
and gif eny cite of ķe regne 
mygt taÞe harme of enemyes. 
Perfore straungers schold not be maad wardeynes 
noķer Þepers of passages, 
of hauenes, 
noķer of stroyte entrees 
noķer of oķer suche place 
by ķe whiche straungers 
and aliens mygte entre, 
but suche place of entryng 
scholde be besiliche iÞepte and iwarded. 
Pe ferķe counsaile [is of pees and of werre ķat] 
is not to takynge of pees 
and of werre [of citeseyns]. 
For pes of citeseyns is finalliche desired 
and werre is contrarie ķerto, 
and no man of rigt witte taÞeķ counsail of ķe fynal ende for consaile 
is not but of thinges ķat ben in doute. 
For counsaile is as it were a certeyne questioun 
and as a certeyne proporciounÞat is in doute. 
A n d of ķe ende Þat is principatliche desired 
no man douteķ whether it be to pursewynge oķer no, 
and eche man knowek ķat ķe contrarie 
is to voidynge. 
Perfore pees of citeseynes scholde be Þepte 
and isaued by mygt and strengthe, 
and here strif and werre scholde be voyded with mygt and strengthe. 
A n d herof is no questioun noķer counsaile scholde be taÞe. 
But wheÞer | f. we schul haue pees oķer werre wik straungers 
it is to doute 
oķer may be doute, 
and ķerof counsaile scholde be taÞe. 
A n d in ķis doynge tweyn ben to wetynge; 
first, 
ķat neuere wrongful werre be itaÞe. 
For doyng wrong to oķere men and ouersette hem wrongfulliche 
is euel of itself 
and scholde be forsaÞe. 
Panne gif ķe werre semeķ rigtful, 
it is to takyng hede of mygt 
and strengthe of ķe regne oķer citee ķat w o l werre, 
how greet ķe mygt is 
and how greet helpe may come ķerto of outward place. 
Also it is to takyng hede of mygt of aduersaries; 
for as ķe philosofer seith, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
we scholde haue pees with goode men 
and with euele men 
we scholde figte oķer not figte. 
if ķei ben strengere ķan we so ķat we mow not withstonde hem gif ķei mysdok vs, 
it is wisdom 
ķat we rise not agenst hem 
but we see oure tyme 
whanne we may taÞe wreche of hem. 
Pe fifte of ķe whiche consaille scholde be taÞe is geuynge of lawes. 
For as it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
sauacioun of citées 
stondeķ in lawes, 
for citées and règnes ben isaued by rigtful lawes. 
For wikoute rigtwisnesse 
may not a regne stonde. 
A n d kynges scholde knowe h 
o w manye manere lordschipes ķer ben 
and how manye manere princi­ pates, 
and what principate is most durable, 
and how ķe principate in ķe whiche a manj [is] lorde may be saued and destroyed. 
A n d chesynge ķe beste manere of principate 
ķei scholde geue rigtful lawes 
by ķe whiche ķat principate may be saued. 
A n d I whiche is ķe beste manere of principate 
and what is a kynges col. office 
and how a kyng scholde Þepe and saue hymself 
in his lordschipe 
tofore it is declared. 
Wherfore by thinges ķat ben iseid 
by help of assaye 
and experience of particuler doynges 
ķat ben alway iseie 
in r courtis of kyngis and of princes, 
aj rector of a citee and of regne may lerne how counsaille scholde be take 
in euynge of lawes 
and what lawes scholde be igeue to saue his principate. 
In chapitres ķat folwen we thinke to make grete inquisiciouns of lawes 
so ķat by thinges 
ķat ben iseid 
and schal be seid soķ and trowke may be ķe betere iknowe. Chapter XX 
For in ķe chapitre tofore we hauen itreted of princes 
declarynge what manere man scholde be a prince 
and tretede of counsaile 
what manere men scholde be consaillours 
and of what thinges 
and how manye counsaille scholde be take, 
now by ķe ordre ķat is iset it is to tretynge of ķe eld halle and of dome, 
declaryng how ķat d 
o o m scholde be eue, 
and [how] manye manere lawes ķer ben, 
and oķere ķat longeķ to ķis matere. 
But for doom scholde be eue 
by lawe oķere 
by free wille oķer by eyÞer, 
ar we declare how doom scholde be eue 
as it is possible, 
we w o l declare ķat it is possible 
al kynges scholde be demed 
by lawe and ful fewe mow be vppoun 
fre wille of iuges. 
A n d ķis may be preued by foure weyes of ķe whiche ķre ben itouched, primo Rethoricorum, 
and ķe ferķe is itouched, 
vi Poleticorum. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For euers of lawes ben lees | 
f. ķanne iuges ķat demen 
by lawes ķat ben ieue. 
For in eche citee nedeķ 
to haue a comyn eld halle 
to ķe whiche causes 
and plee ķat risen 
in ķe citee mot be brout. 
A n d by lawes ķat ben imaad 
in a citee manye citées may be reweled. 
A n d in ķe same citee 
in ķe whiche lawes ben imaad 
ben moo iuges ķan makers of lawes. 
For gif lawes ben ritful, 
ķei scholde be as it were inmutable. 
Wherfore in suche lawes scholde be litel chaungyng oķer none but iuges ķat demen by ķilke lawe deyen and ben corupte. 
Also wikoute corupcioun and deeķ iuges ben iput out of here office 
and oķere ibrout in here stede. 
Panne nameliche in passynge of tyme 
in ķe same citee nedeķ 
to haue manye iuges, 
for ķei ben as it were alwey chaunged and renewed. 
But it nedeķ not in ķat wise haue manye makers of lawes, 
for lawes ben not alwey so ichaunged and renewed. 
Wherfore gif makers of lawe ben fewere ķan iuges, 
for it is esiere to fynde fewe wise men 
ķan manye for to dispose alle thinges wiseliche, 
it is spedful ķat alle thinges 
be demed by lawe 
as it is possible and ful fewe 
by fre avisement and wille of iuges. 
Pe seconde wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For it is more esy 
and betere to knowe 
what is ritful gif 
it is long tyme 
bysiliche itreted ķanne gif it nedeķ anon 
to eue centence and doom. 
Also makers of lawes 
mowe avise hem longe tyme 
and by greet counsaile what lawes ķei scholde make. 
But for instaunce of partees iuges 
scholde not drawe lawes 
along noķer tarye ķe partees, 
but spede hem and hauen ķerfore | not col. v Book III Part II 
long tyme inowe to avise hem 
what is rigtful 
in suche an ende. 
Panne for me scholde not erre in demynge, 
al kyng scholde be demed by lawes 
as it is possible, 
and fewe by fre avisement 
and wille of iuges. 
Pe ķridde wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For makers of lawes maken lawes in general 
who ķat euere doķ 
so he schal be ponysched so, 
vnwetynge wheÞer frend oķer enemy schal do so 
and haue suche a peyne. 
if he knewe ķat a frend scholde do suche a dede, 
on caas key wolde wikdrawe ķe peyne in demynge; 
and gif he knewe ķat an enemy scholde do suche a dede, 
on cas he wolde lenye 
to ķe contrarie îo 
and sette more peyne. 
And now for lawes ben igeue onliche in general 
so ķat ķei ķat geuen ķe lawe knowen not in particuler what schal befalle, 
a j ben ķerfore not inclined to do wrong 
in demynge for loue noķer for hate. 
But iuges faren not so, 
for here domes ben not of dedes ķat ben to comyng 
but of dedes ķat ben apassed, 
and not in general 
but in particuler and inclined to a certeyn persone. 
A n d ofte suche thinges 
hauen purpos annexed ķerto. 
Perfore a iuge may sone erre, 
for ķei ķat louen 
and haten and taken hede 
of worldeliche profit 
demen not alwey euene. 
Wherfore for doome scholde not be wrong, 
it is good in so moche 
as it is poscible 
ķat alle thinges be demed 
by lawe and ful fewe 
by fre avisement and wille of iuges. A n d ķe philosofer toucheķ ķes ķre resons, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
and seith ķat it is most rigtfulliche 
to deme by lawes ķat ben isette as fork as it is possible, 
and to deme wel fewe 
by fre avisement | 
and wil of iuges. First, 
for on oķer fewe wise men 
ben sonnere ifounde ķan manye. 
Pe seconde, 
for lawes ben imaad 
by avisement of longe tyme and domes ben igeue of kynges 
ķat risen and sodeynliche. 
A n d Þe ķridde is most of alle, 
for lawes ben imaad of thinges 
Þat ben to comynge and in general. 
But a parfit iuge demeķ of certeyne thinges 
Þat ben apassed oķer present 
and is iloued oķer hated, 
and to eche purpos 
is ofte som profite annexed. 
Pe ferķe wey % to preue ķe same 
may be declared in ķis wise. 
For as it schal be declared herafter sum thinges 
mot be demed 
by fre avise­ ment 
and w i l of iugis, 
for particular doingis mowe not be rekenid 
at fülle noķer 
al ķingis schulde be demid bi lawe, 
naķeles as fork 
as it is possible 
al ķingis schulde be demid 
by fre avisement 
and w i l of iuges. 
For as ķe philosofir seyth, sexto Poleticorum, 
ķe lasse enemyte 
is in hem 
ķat folwen for ķe doom, 
ķe sonnere ķei scholde haue an ende and execucioun of ķe doom. 
Wherfore [for] a iuge demynge mysdoers 
haķ not so greet enemyte 
as ķei scholde gif ķei demede hem 
by his owne fre avisement and wille, 
for ķe iuge scholde not be inclined 
for drede of enemyte 
to tarie rigtful doom 
oķer to spare rigtful doom, 
as fork as it is poscible al kynges scholde be demed 
by lawe and fewe 
by fre avisement and wille f. i r of iuges. 
For a iuge is ful excused 
whan he demeķ by lawe, 
for it semeķ not his doynge 
but he is compelled by ķe lawe 
to geue suche a doom. Chapter XXI Ivges scholde taÞe heede to maÞe 
suche processe in doom 
so ķat angry wordis 
and hote and euil sittingge 
ķat meļueķ to wrakÞe and to col. 
hate be forbode in doom. 
For manye ķat pleden, 
knowyng ķat here cause is nougt, 
telleķ not what is ido 
and what is not idoo 
but fonden to meue ķe iuge to wrethe 
and to hate agenst here aduersaries and to goodnesse and mercy toward hemself. 
But ķat suche wordes scholde be forbode we may preue by ķre weyes. 
Pe firste, 
for suche wordes 
maÞen ķe iuge erre ķat nedeķ to be 
as ķe rewle in demynge. 
Pe seconde, 
for suche wordes 
bynemen ķe ordre of demynge. 
Pe ķridde, 
for ķei ben inpertinent to ķe purpos. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For we schal knowe ķat a iuge in demynge of plee 
for to deme arigt scholde be bytwene hem ķat pleden, 
as ķe tonge demynge of sauours oķer as of eche oķer wit demynge of sencible knowynge 
ķat longeķ ķerto scholde be bytweyne sauours oķer bytweyne sencible propre thinges. 
For a cencible wit is mené proporcioun betwyne sencible thinges 
ķat longeķ ķerto, 
as ķe sigt is mené proporcioun bytwene thinges 
ķat ben iseye 
and ķe huyryng 
betwene thinges 
ķat ben ihurd 
and so in oķere. 
And while ķe witte 
is not infecte by oon contrarie, 
it geueth ritful doom of cencible thinges 
ķat ķei feien. 
As while ķe tonge 
is not infecte wik euel humour, 
it dem­ eķ arit 
and demeķ ķat bitter 
is bitter 
and swete is swete; 
and gif it is infecte wik colera oķer wik flewme oķer 
with som oķer euel humoure, 
ķanne as ķei he were not in ķe myddel 
but idrawe to ķe on contrarie side, 
it demeķ amys and demeķ of swete ķat it is b[i]tter and aeward, 
as it fareķ in siÞe men 
whanne here | taast is infecte. 
So a iuge while he f. i is mené 
bytwene partees 
and as it were an euene rewle not inclined to ķe oon partie, 
he seith ķat rigt is rit 
and wrong is wrong. 
And gif ķe iuges is inclined to ķe on partie 
by mercye oķer by frend­ schipe and forsaÞeķ 
ķe oķer partie for wrethe oķer for hate, 
ķanne he is as it were a croÞede rewle and demen amys. 
A n d for euel sittynge wordes 
is cause of suche doynge, 
it is al oon to suffre suche wordes 
in doom 
and to maÞe ķe rewle croÞede. 
Panne gif it is inconuenyent 
to maÞe Þe rewle croÞed, 
it is inconuenient in doom 
to suffre euele sittynge wordes. 
For as it schal be declared, 
iuges scholde be more inclined to mercy ķanne to ponyschyng, suffryng; 
and wordes ķat meueķ 
to mercye and goodnesse schulde be more suffred ķan wordes ķat meuen to wrethe and to hate. 
Pe seconde wey to preue 
ķat suche wordes 
scholde not be suffred 
is itaÞe for suche wordes 
mysternek ķe ordre of demynge, 
for in demyng v Book III Part II is a certeyn ordre. 
For ķer is som 
what as it were heygest 
and som what as it were mené 
and som what as it were lowest, 
as ķe heighest [is] ķe lawe oķer ķe prince oķer som who ķat maÞeķ ķe lawe, 
as mené is ķe iuge, 
as Þe loweste is he ķat is acused oķer parties ķat pleten, ķe iuge is mené bytwene 
maÞere of lawe and hem ķat pleden. 
For ķe mené scholde haue 
som what of eiķer side, 
Þe iuge as mené taÞeķ 
som what of eiķer side. 
For of ķe maÞere of lawe he taÞeķ 
what is rigtful and nougt rigtful. 
A n d gif rigt is iknowe 
by lawes of hym 
by whoos lawes | col. ķe iuge is irewled in demynge, 
he lerneķ what is rigtful 
in nedes and dedes of mankynde; 
ķanne of ķe maÞere of lawes 
ķe iuges lerneķ what is rightful, 
and of ķe parties he lerneth what is ido oķer not idoo. 
A n d gif he lernede <not> of hem 
what is rigtful (trowthe and good conscience techeth what is rigtful), 
% ķat is by accident 
in so moche as Þei aleggen lawes 
ķat ben imaad by ķe maÞere of lawes. 
Panne for passionale wordes 
inclinen to wille and maÞen 
som what sum rigtful 
ķat is not rigtful, 
for passionat men - 
as men ķat louen and haten 
and ben glad oķer sory - 
ben not alle idemed in on wise, 
it is al oon to suffre passionale wordes 
in doom 
and to ouertorne ķe ordre of demynge. For gif it is isuffred, 
ķe parties ben imaad 
maÞers of lawes and isette 
in ķe heigeste gree in demynge 
and scholde be in loweste. 
A n d ķere suche ordre is ouerturned, 
for ķe partees wik suche wordes 
maÞen som what sum rigtful 
ķat is not rigtful; 
and ķat is not ķe office 
of ķe parties 
but of maÞeris of lawis. 
For be ķe maÞer of lawis 
oķer bi is lawis 
ķe iuge schulde 
k n o w what is rigtful 
and what is not rigtful, 
and not bi ķe partees ķat pleden noķer 
by suche wordes ispoÞe. 
Pe ķridde wey is itaÞe for suche wordes 
ben inpertinent to ķe pur­ pos 
and ben wikoute cause. 
For whanne plee is of eny thing 
oķer of beynge, 
no kyng scholde be seide in doom 
but pertinent to ķe kyng oķere cause 
ķat is ipleted. 
Spekyng of suche wordes 
tofore ķe iuge, 
and telle wronges ķat ķe oķer partie 
haķ idoo to ķe iuge 
and good ķat ķei hamself 
hauen idoo to ķe iuge, 
and mouen ķe iuge in ķis wise 
to maļ lice 
toward ķe oķer partie 
and to loue toward hymself 
is not to f. i purpos. 
Wherfore suche doynge scholde not be suffred. 
r Chapter XXII We may reÞene foure 
ķat is nedful to iuges for to geue rigtful domes and trewe. 
Pe firste is auctorite of demynge; 
ķe seconde is redinesse of kynges; 
ķe ķridde, experience and assay of doynges and of dedes; 
ķe ferķe, rigtful wille. 
For as it longeķ to ķis doynge, 
in eche plee foure scholde be knowe. 
Pe partees ķat pleden; 
ķe cause ķat is ipleted; 
lawes by ķe whiche plee schal be demed; 
and ķe maÞere of ķe lawe oķer ķe princes 
ķat geuen auctorite for to deme. 
And for to deme rigt it is spedful to iugis to taÞe hede of al ķes, 
for ķe dome schold not be wrongfulliche 
igeue and without auctorite, 
noķer vnlaweful, 
noķer fais, 
noķer presumptuous. 
For gif iuges beren hem not wel 
to the geuere of ķe lawes, 
ķanne Þey geuen a wrongful doom 
ķat is icleped vsurpate; 
for ķei taÞen more vpoun hem ķan ķei scholde. 
A n d ķanne iuges beren hem not wel to ķe geuere of lawe 
whanne ķei passen here auctorite and commyssioun. 
Pe seconde, iuges geuen 
a iuel doom ķat is icleped temerarium 
gif ķei beren hemsilf not wel to ķe lawes, 
as gif ķei ben vnredy in knowynge of lawes; 
for wikoute knowynge of lawes 
cause may not be demed arigt. 
Pe ķridde, 
iuges geuen an yuel doom ķat is icleped iniquum gif ķei beren not hemself 
wel to ķe partees ķat pleden. 
For as it is iseid, 
a iuge scholde be as it were 
a rigtful rewle 
bytwene twey partees. 
[Wherfore gif suche rewle] 
ben|den forkward ķe mené, 
lenynge toward ķe oon col. partie for loue and froward ķe oķere partie for hate, 
ķanne ķei mote deme wrongfulliche; 
for ķanne ķe doom comeķ not of loue of rigt but of loue oķer hate of ķe parties. 
Pe iiii, gif iuges beren hem not wel to ķe nedes and dedes, 
and gif ķei be not expert 
in wordes and dedes [of] mankynde, 
Þey w o l % geue doom ķat is suspecte, 
for som tyme for ligt suspeccioun ķei geuen doom agenst oķere men. 
Panne ķe doom 
is not rigtful 
but ķer 
by auctorite of demynge, 
cunnynge of lawe, 
loue of rigtwisnesse, 
and experience of doynges and dedes. 
For as in cure of bodiliche siknesse 
som tyme he ķat is expert doķ more profit ķan he ķat haķ ķe craft 
for ķei knowe particuler condicions, 
so in doom of dedes 
and causes som tyme ķei ķat ben expert doķ more profit ķa[n] ķei ķat knowen ķe lawe. 
Panne alle ķe forsaide 
nedeķ to deme arigt. 
Panne it is declared 
what manere iuges of causes 
a kyng scholde haue. 
For ķei scholde be meÞe 
and not passe here 
commynssioun and auctorite, 
wis and kunnynge in lawe, 
and konnynge to applie ķe lawes 
to ķe plee. 
A n d ķei scholde louye rigt and geue doom 
not for loue noķer for hate of partees, 
but for loue of rigtwisnesse. 
And ķei scholde haue experience and assay of doynges 
and dedes and knowe particuler doynges 
for to declare causes ķe bettre. Chapter XXIII 
As it longeķ to ķis doynge we may reÞene ten ķe whiche ķe philos­ 
ofer reÞeneķ, primo Rethoricorum, 
to ķe whiche a iuge most taÞe heede 
for to spare men | 
and for to be more mylde ķan cruel. 
Pe firste is f. mankynde. 
Pe seconde is Þe geuere of lawe. 
Pe ķridde, 
ful knowyng of lawe. 
Pe ferķe is entente ķat worchek. 
Pe fifte, multitude of good worÞes. 
Pe sixte, lengķe of tyme ķat is apassed. 
Pe seuenķe, goodnesse v Book III Part II passynge malice. 
Pe eigte is pacience ķat is accused. 
Pe nynÞe, 
gif he ķat trespasseķ 
is able to be amended. 
Pe tenķe is lownesse ķat trespassen. 
A n d first, mankynde crieķ for myldenesse 
for hem ķat trespassen. 
For mankynde is feble of itself 
and chaungable and inclyned to euel; 
<J> gif it happeķ 
ķat a man trespasse, 
brotelnesse of kynde cryek mercye. 
Perfore it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
ķat epie[i]Þes haķ mercy of mankynde, 
and he is icleped epy[e]iÞes ķat is aboue rigt oķer aboue rigtwisnesse. 
Panne ķe philosofer clepeķ hym supra iustum ķat sparen mankynde, 
for myldenesse scholde be aboue cruelnesse 
and aboue rigtwisnesse. 
Pe seconde ķat scholde meue a iuge to myldenesse 
is ķe geuere of lawe. 
For on caas ķe kyng oķer prince ķat geueķ lawe, 
gif ķei knewe ķe condicions of hem ķat trespassen, 
ķei wolde haue mercye on hem. 
Wherfore gif ķe iuge may knowe ķat ķe maÞere of lawe 
wolde despence and spare hym ķat is gilty, 
ķei scholde be more merciable ķan cruel. 
Perfore it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
ķat a iuge scholde taÞe more heede to ķe maÞere of lawe ķan to lawe. 
Pe ķridde ķat meueķ to myldenesse 
is mylde vnderstondynge of lawes. 
For to fere mysdoers, 
lawes conteynen ķe | more cruelnesse. 
col. Wherfore gif wordes of lawe be ķe more cruel 
for to fere euel doers, 
it is semeliche ķat greet payne be modérât 
by mylde vnderstondyng. 
Panne ķis is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
ķat a iuge schulde taÞe heede not onliche of ķe worÞes of ķe lawe 
but to ķe vnderstondynge of ķe lawe. 
Pe ferķe is intencioun of hym ķat doķ ķe dede. 
For ķei ķe dede of ķe whiche a man is accused be of ķe kynde of euel dedes, 
git on caas his entencioun was not euel; 
oķer gif it was euel, 
on caas it was not so euel 
as it semede by ķe dede; 
oķer for dedes 
ķat ben in doute scholde be demed 
to ķe bettere side - 
gif ķe iuge may knowe in eny wise 
ķat he ķat trespassede trespasede not 
by his owne fre w i l but by vnkunnynge oķer by myshappe, 
ķanne ķe iuge scholde be inclyned to myldenesse. 
Perfore it is iseide, primo Rethoricorum, 
ķat a iuge scholde taÞe hede not onliche to ķe dede but also to ķe eleccioun. 
Pe fifķe ķat meuen to mercye 
is multitude of goode dedes. 
For on caas he ķat haķ 
now itrespassed haķ tofore hond 
ido manye goode dedes, 
ķanne a iuge scholde not so moch taÞe heede to a party, 
as to ķis particuler doyng 
in ķe whiche on haķ itrespassed, 
as to ķe hoole, 
as to many goode dedes 
ķat he dede tofore honde. 
Perfore it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
ķat a iuge scholde not taÞe heede 
to ķe partees 
as to al ķe hoole. 
Pe sexte is lengķe of tyme apassed. 
For it may be ķat on doķ manye goode dedes in litel tyme, 
ķanne tweyne thingis bene ķat schold meue a kyng and eche oķer lord to louye his sogette - 
oķer for he haķ ido hym gret seruyce, 
oķer for he haķ iserued hym longe | tyme. 
A n d f. comynliche ķes tweyne comyn togedres; 
for gif ķei seruede hym long tyme, 
he dede hym moche seruyce and agenward. 
Nathales ķes tweyne mow be departed, 
for a man serueķ not anoķer 
but in Þew tyme 
whanne it is to doynge. 
A n d it may be ķat in long tyme is but litel to doynge 
and in litel tyme moche to doynge. 
And ķis sixte ķat meueķ to myldenesse 
is not ķe fifte ķat J taÞeķ heede of lengķe of tyme, 
for ķe fifte taÞeķ hede of manye worÞes. 
Wherfore gif it happeķ 
ķat a sogett trespasseķ 
in eny party of tyme ķat haķ wel ibore hym al ķe tyme tofore honde, 
with hym it is to doynge merciabliche. 
A n d it is to takynge more heede to moche 
as to al ķe hoole tyme tofore honde 
Þanne to Þis litel partye of tyme 
in Þe whiche he haķ itrespassed. 
Perfore it is iseide, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
ķat a iuge scholde taÞe heede not onliche 
how it is now wik hym Þat is accused, 
but also what manere man 
he haķ ibe long tyme tofore honde. 
Pe seuenķe Þat meueķ to myldenesse 
is goodnesse passynge malice. 
For as good passeķ euel 
and is more worthi 
to be chose ķanne is euel, 
so it is bettere to haue mynde of good 
and of gracious dedes 
ķat we hauen ifonge of a man 
ķan of wronges 
ķat we hauen ifonge of hym. 
A n d in ķis doynge Iulius Cesar was gretliche ipreysed for, 
as it is iseid, 
he hadde no mynde of wronges 
but for<g>at hem. 
Also gif on trespassede agenst vs ķat haķ ido vs moche good tofore honde, 
we schulde do merciabliche by hym | 
and haue more mynde of ķe good col. : 
ķat he haķ ido vs ķan of ķe wronge. 
Perfore, primo Rethoricorum, 
ķe philosofer 
w o l meue iuges to mercy agenst hem 
ķat trespassen agenst hem, 
and seith ķat ķei scholde haue more mynde of good 
ķat ķei hauen ifonge of hym 
ķat trespassen ķan of wrong 
ķat he haķ idoo. Pe eigte is his pacience ķat is accused. 
For gif oon is accused of eny trespas f o r Þ 
e whiche he is ponysched by ķe iuge, 
gif he taÞeķÞat ponyschynge pacientliche, aworthe, and gruccheķ not in ķe penaunce 
ķat is isette hym, 
it is to doynge ķe more merciabliche by hym. 
Perfore it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
ķat it is to foregeuynge to mankynde gif he ķat haķ peyne taÞeķ it pacientliche. 
Pe nynÞe is ablenesse to be amended. 
For som men ben able to ben amended and ichasted ķat ķei ben amended onliche by blamynge oķer by a word and leueķ to do amys. 
A n d suche scholde be gretliche ispared 
and ful goodliche itreted. 
Perfore it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricor­ um, 
ķat a iuge scholde spare ķe more gif he ķat trespasseķ 
w o l be more idemed by word Þan by dede. 
Pe tenķe Þat meueķ 
to mercye 
and to myldenesse 
is his lownesse and myldenesse Þat trespasseķ. 
For gif he ķat trespasseķ 
lowek hymself and meÞeķ hym atte fülle and putteķ hym hoolliche 
atte iuges wille, 
he scholde be ķe more ispared. 
Perfore it is iseid, 
primo Reth­ oricorum, 
ķat a iuge epyeiÞes (ķat is passynge rigtful) schulde spare Book III Part II mankynde if he seek ķat [he ķat] trespasseķ drawek more to ķe iuges wille ķan to deceyt. 
| For it is al aenst reson of mankynde 
to spare hem 
not ķat meÞeķ hem, 
for bestes sparen suche. 
For ho[u]ndes greuen not hem 
ķat meÞen hem 
and fallen doun tofore hem. 
Perfore it is iseide, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
ķat wrethe 
<cess>eķ aenst hem ķat meÞeķ hem. 
Also houndes ben mylde 
and biten not hem ķat sitten. 
Panne it is declared 
how iuges scholde be more mylde ķan cruel. 
A n d if iuges scholde do so, 
moche more kynges and princes scholde so 
for kynges and princes scholde haue more goodnesse. 
Also ķei scholde be mylde and goodliche not onliche touchinge rit, 
for Þerwikoute may not ķe pees of ķe regne 
and good staat of citeseyns stonde, 
but sauynge comune profit and pees of ķe regne 
as fork 
as it is possible 
ķei scholde be inclyned to mercye. 
A n d how mercie may stonde with rit it schal be declared here after. 
f. i Chapter XXIV 
For lawes be som what of rigt 
by ķe whiche we ben irewled in oure dedes, 
demynge by lawes what is rit 
and what is wrong in oure dedes, 
it is playnliche iknowe ķat 
as we distingwek rit 
we may distingwe lawes and aenward. 
A n d boķe of rit 
and of lawe 
we may maÞe fyue distinccions. 
Tweyne ķerof ben itouched, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
ķe ķridde is isette, 
v Ethicorum, 
and Þe ferķe is ivsed among legistres, 
and we may putte ķe fifte. 
Rit, ķat is lawe, 
is distingwed, 
for som is iwrete 
and som not iwrete, 
and som is comyne 
and som is propre, 
and som is kyndeliche and som is lawefulliche and imaad. | 
And ķe philosofer maÞeķ ķis ķre distinccions coi. 
of rit and of lawe. 
But legistres distynguen in ķe ferķe manere 
and meneķ ķat som rit 
is icleped ius gencium, 
as it were rit oķer lawe of nacions. 
A n d som rit and lawe 
is icleped ius ciuile, 
ritful lawe of ciuel. 
Panne as legistres setteķ differences 
bytweyne kyndeliche rit 
and rit of nacions, 
we may sette difference 
bytwene kyndeliche rit and rit of bestes 
and eueķ ķe fifķe distinccioun of rit 
menynge ķat ķer is foure manere of rit: kyndelich rit, rigt of bestes, rit of nacions, 
and ciuel rit. 
A n d ķese fyue distincciouns 
Þat we maÞen of rit 
oķer of ritful we may maÞe of lawe. 
Panne for to declare aile ķese 
and for to brynge al ķese diuersitees to acorde, 
it is to wetynge 
ķat ķer is double ritwisnesse 
ķat is icleped iusticia 
oķer double lawe, 
lawe of kynde and lawe imaad. 
A n d kynde rit 
is icleped 
what is acordyng to kynde, 
oķer ritful is icleped ķat folwek kynde resoun 
and to ķe whiche we ben kyndeliche inclined. 
A n d a positif rit is deuyded, 
for som what is ritful not of kynde 
but by ordinance oķer heeste of men; 
also, 
for kynde of thinges 
is ķe same v in eche place, 
for what is fuyre in oon place 
as in Fraunce is fuyre in anoķer place 
as in Ytalie, 
for thinges ben ķe same in eche place 
ķei he haue not ķe same names. 
But statutes of men and ordenaunce of cite­ seyns and hestes of princes 
ben not ķe same in eche place. 
Perfore it is ķat kyndelich rigt 
[is d i s t i n g u e d f r o p o s i t i f ri^t, 
f o r k y n d e l i c h ri^t] haķ ķe same mygt 
in eche place 
as it is iseid, 
v Ethicorum. 
But positif rigt and rigtful bindeķ not | noķer vnbyndek 
ar it be iordeyned by statute, 
f. and ķanne it byndek first. 
A n d cause w h i it nedeķ to haue rigt and rigt­ ful positif to rigt of kynde 
is for manye thinges 
ben rigtful by kynde - 
as by kynde it is rigtful 
ķat a man speÞe, 
for we hauen kynde inclynacioun for to speÞe and for to telle oķere men by speche 
what we hauen in ķougt. 
But for to speÞe ķis langage oķer ķat it is not kyndeliche 
but as men liÞeķ, 
ķerfore it is ķat al men speÞen 
but not al men speÞen ķe same langage. Perfore, [i] Periarmanyas, 
ķe philosofer seith 
ķat voice and speche 
is at likynge and seith, 
primo Poleticorum, 
ķat kynde geueķ vs speche. 
Panne as spekynge is kyndeliche, 
so spe[k]yng is positif and at likynge. 
So ponyschyng of ķeues 
and sleyng of euel doers is kyndeliche, 
for kynde resoun wol ķat it be so and we hauen kynde inclynacioun ķerto for suche doyng comeķ of kynde of kynges. 
For it is kyndeliche ķat a partye be put in perel for sauacioun of al ķe hoole, 
as a roted lyme is itorne and igurd of for to saue al ķe body - 
so a ķeef and an euel doere 
ķat desturbleķ pees of citeseyns 
and ariseķ agenst comyn profit. 
Perfore kynde rigt w o l ķat he be dede 
as a roted lyme is igurd of for to saue ķe comyn profit fro perel. 
Panne it is kyndeliche ķat suche dedes be iponysched, 
but for to ponysche suche dedes in ķat manere oķer in ķis wise it is positif. 
Perfore among al men ķat w o l lyue cyuel lif, 
euel dedes ben iponysched; 
but not among alle men 
ķe same euele dedes ben iponysched 
by ķe same paynes. 
Panne where | kyndeliche rigt 
endeķ ķere positif rigt 
bygynnek col. to springe, 
for alwey ordinaunce ķat is ifounde by craft of men 
is igrounded in kynges ķat comeķ of kynde. 
A n d positif rigt ķat is ifounde 
by wit and craft of men 
may not be wikoute kynde rigt as kynges ķat ben by craft mowe not be wikoute thinges 
ķat comeķ of kynde. 
Wherfore gif kynde rigt 
w o l ķat ķefes and euel doers be ponysched, 
positif rigt supposeķ ķat and passeķ forķere and ordeynek 
how suche scholde be ponysched. 
For ķis is iknowe, 
as it longeķ to ķis doynge 
we may assigne double difference 
bytwene kynde rigt and positif rigt. 
Pe firste is for kynde rigt 
is iknowe at firste, 
and positif rigt is not anon iknowe 
but it is ifounde 
by witte and craft of men. 
A n d for kynde rygt 
and kynde lawe is so anoon yknowe 
and what is sympliche of kynde, 
it is iseid ķat kynde rigt and kynde lawe 
is iwrete in owre hertes. 
For men ķat hauen no r Book III Part II 
is iwrete in here hertes. 
A n d for positif rigt and lawe 
is not so iwrete in herte, 
it mot be iwrete 
in som outward substance 
for to Þepe it in mynde. 
Also eiķer rit and lawe, 
boķe kyndelich and positif, 
may be wrete in som outward substaunce. 
But it is not so greet nede to write kynde rit 
and l[aw]e outward as it is to write so positif rißt and lawe, 
for it may not so passe out of mynde 
as positif rigt may. 
Pe seconde diuersete is for kynde rigt 
is ķe same among alle men | f. 
and is ķerfore icleped comyne rit oķer comyn lawe. 
But positif rit and positif lawe 
is diuers in diuerse citées 
and is ķerfore icleped proper rit and proper lawe. 
As ķe philosofer reherseķ, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
ķerfore Empédocles clepeķ 
kynde rigt oķer kynde lawe fuyre ķat streccheķ alwey by gret clernesse; 
for fuyre in his owne spere and place streccheķ 
more ķan oķere elementes and is more large ķan alle ķe oķere 
and is ilikned to kynde rit 
and to kynde lawe ķat 
is more large and more comyn ķan positif rigt and lawe 
and more clerliche iknowe. 
Herby it may be knowe ķat al ķe distinccions 
ķat ķe philosofer 
maÞeķ of rigt oķer of ritful mowe 
be reducte to positif rit 
and to kynde rit. 
For as it is declared, 
kynde rit is not iwrete 
but it is comyn and by kynde, 
and po[s]iti[f] rit 
is icleped rit iwrete, 
imaad and laweful. 
A n d what is ķe soÞe menyng of ķe rit of naciouns 
ķat is icleped ius gencium 
and of rit of bestes ķat 
is icleped ius animalium, 
in ķe nexte chapitre it schal be declared. 
v Chapter XXV 
Aile ķe distincciouns of rit and of lawe ķat ķe philosofer toucheķ 
in ķe nexte chapitre 
tofore ben of twey menbris 
of ķe whiche oo membre 
is conteyned vnder rit and lawe of kynde 
and ķe oķer vnder rißt 
and lawe of ciuel oķer lawe positif. 
But as it is iseide, 
legistres don to ķe ķridde membre and clepeķ it ius gencium, 
as it were rit and lawe of naciouns. 
A n d by ķat manere of spekynge ķe ferķe menbre 
may be do to and be icleped ius animalium, lawe of bestes. 
For euedences herof it | 
is to wetynge ķat man in ķat he is man and col. 
itaÞe 
by his owne propre resoun 
is oķer ķan oķere bestes; 
but in ķat man is a best 
and itaÞe by comyn resoun, 
man accordeķ with oķere bestes. 
Panne if thinges 
% ben of kyndelich rit 
to ķe whiche we hauen kynde appetite and inclinacioun, 
% suche kynde appetite 
folwek oure kynde in ķat we ben men 
and in ķat we ben oķere ķan oķere bestes; 
and such rit oķer lawe 
is icleped ius gencium, 
as it were rit of men oķer of nacions. 
A n d if ķat inclinacioun and appetite folwek oure kynde in 
ķat it accordeķ with oķere bestes, 
so it is icleped ius naturale, 
kynde rit oķer lawe. 
īo Perfore in ķe Institutes, 
De lure Naturāli, 
where ķis matere is itreted, 
it is iseid ķat ius naturale, 
kynde rigt, 
is ķat kynde techeķ alle bestes. 
And as it is iseid ķere, 
suche rigt 
is not onliche of mankynde 
but of alle bestes ķat breden in heuene oķere in erķe oķer in ķe see. 
A n d by ķis doynge of kynde rigt, 
maal and femel comen togeders 
and gendren children 
and bryngen hem fork. 
For gif man is kyndeliche inclined herto, 
and gif suche inclinacioun 
and appetite folwek mankynde, 
% [it folwek] 
not in ķat ķat it is mankynde 
but in ķat ķat it is kynde of beestes 
and in ķat ķat it accordeķ 
with oķere bestes; 
for oķer bestes 
ben inclyned that maal and femel come togeders and gendre children 
and feede and norische hem. 
And ius gencium, 
rigt of men oķer of nacions, is not comyne to oķere beestes 
but it is comyn to al mankynde. 
A n d of ķis rigt and lawe comeķ 
nyg aile contractes 
as byggyng and sellyng | 
and huryng and settynge f. 
to huyre and oķere suche doynges 
withoute ķe whiche companye of mankynde 
is not suffisaunt to itself in leuynge. 
Perfore it is ķat borwynge 
and leyenge to wedde ķat helpeķ 
to leuynge of mankynde 
is conteyned vnder ķis rigt 
and lawe ķat hatte ius gencium, lawe of folk. 
A n d oķere bestes comuneķ 
not in suche doynge. 
Panne ius gencium, lawe of folk, is as it were kynde rigt idrawe of kynde. 
Also ķat rigt and lawe ķat kynde techeķ alle beestes 
and folwek oure inclinacioun 
in ķat we accorden wik oķere beestes 
is icleped kynde rigt in comparisoun 
to ķe rigt 
ķat hatte ius gencium. 
For gif thinges 
ķat ben iseid 
in ķe nexte chapitre ben iknowe, 
kynde rigt is som what comyne 
and som what yknowe. 
And ķe more rigt is iknowe 
and ķe more comyne it is and ķe more vnchangeable, 
ķe more it is worthi 
to be cleped kynde rigt. 
And ķat rigt ķat kynde techeķ alle bestes and by ķe whiche alle beestes acordeķ is more comyn 
ķan ķe rigt ķat hatte ius gencium; 
and so it is more yknowe, 
for kyng ķat is most comyne 
is most iknowe to vs. 
For ķe more general a kyng is, 
ķe better we knowen it. 
Also suche rigt is more vnchangeable; 
for ķe more ķe re wies of lawe ben applied to a special matere, 
ķe mo defautes ķei drawen and failleķ 
in ķe moo caas 
and ben ķe more chaungeable. 
Panne suche a rigt is worthi 
to be clepede kynde rigt 
in comparisoun 
to ķe rigt ķat hatte ius gencium. 
For it is iknowe 
how ķe rigt ķat hatte ius gencium, law of puple, 
is oķer ķan ķe rigt ķat hatte ius naturale, 
it may be knowe how ķe rigt I ķat hatte ius animalium 
is oķer ķan ķe rigt ķat hatte ius naturale, coi. 
For as mankynde 
in so moche as man is a beest 
ķei accorden with kynde of oķere beestes, 
so in so moche as he is man, 
he leueķ and haķ beynge and acordeķ 
with treen and with herbes 
and with oķere substaunce 
and with alle kynges ķat ben. 
For man desireķ kyndelich to be Þept and saued in beyng, 
and so doun aile oķere doynges; 
and desiren kyndeliche to gendre children 
and to brynge hem fork, 
and so Book III Part II 
doķ oķer bestes; 
and desiren to lyue in companye 
by good couenantes and forewardes, 
and among alle bestes 
ķat is proper to mankynde. 
Panne gif reweles and dedes and doynge ben 
igrounded in ķat ķat man desireķ kyndeliche to be, 
so suche reweles mow be of kynde rigt 
as mankynde 
is a manere beynge and accordeķ 
with alle thinges ķat ben. 
A n d gif thilÞe re wies ben itaÞe for man desireķ 
kyndeliche to gendre children 
and to brynge hem fork, 
also Þey mowe be of kynde rigt 
as it is iseid 
ķat kynde rigt is ķat kynde techeķ alle beestes. 
But gif ķei ben itaÞe for man desireķ 
to lyue in companye 
by foreward and couenant, 
so ķei ben of kynde rigt 
as kynde rigt 
is idrawe to ķe rigt 
ķat hatte ius gencium 
and is proper oonliche to mankynde. 
Herby it is iknowe ķat 
as ķe rigt 
ķat hatte ius gencium is not so 
kynde rigt 
as ķe rigt 
ķat kynde techeķ alle bestes, 
so ķe rigt ķat kynde techeķ alle bestes is not so kynde rigt as 
ķe rigt ķat folwek ķe inclina­ is cioun of oure kynde in ķat we accordeķ not [onlich] 
wik oķere beestes 
but also wik alle kynges ķat beķ. 
For suche rigt is more iknowe and more comyne ķan ķe oķere, 
for desire | of good 
and of beynge and f. voydynge of harme 
and of not beynge 
is more of kynde rigt ķanne desirynge of gendryng 
and bryngynge fork of children. 
Panne ķis schal be ķe ordre: 
rigt ķat folwek oure kynde 
in so moche as we desiren beynge 
and good is more rigt of kynde ķan ķe rigt of beestes 
oķer ķe rigt ķat kynde techeth alle beestes; 
also suche rigt is more kynde rigt ķan ķe rigt ķat hatte ius gencium, 
lawe and rigt of men oķer of naciouns; 
and is more kyndelich ķan rigt 
and lawe of ciuel ķat is al positif. 
Panne ķre ben in som wise of kyndelich rigt 
in so moche as inclynacioun folwek oure kynde. 
For gif ķat inclinacioun folwek oure kynde 
in so moche 
as it is mankynde, 
ķanne is ķe rigt ķat hatte ius gencium. 
And gif it folwek oure kynde in ķat we accorden with oķere beestes, 
so is ķe rigt ķat kynde techeķ alle beestes. 
A n d gif it folwek oure kynde in ķat we accorden with alle thinges, 
ķanne is ķe rigt 
ķat is excellentliche icleped kynde rigt. 
For desiryng of beynge 
and of good and voydynge of corupcioun 
and of harme ķat we desiren kyndelich, 
in so moche as oure kynde accordeķ wik alle thinges, 
is so of kynde rigt; 
for oķere rewies and oķere lawes, 
boķe kynde lawes and cyuel lawes, 
springeķ here of and is igrounded here inne, for in aile me taÞeķ heede of getynge of good oķer of voidyng of harme. 
But for to trete ķis atte fülle nedeķ 
an heygere doynge, 
and be it inow at ķis tyme 
for to knowe how ķe rigt ius gencium 
and ķe rigt ius animalium 
and also ius ciuile ben oķere ķan ius naturale, 
kyn|deliche col. rigt. v Chapter XXVI 
It semeķ ķat ķe rigt ius cyuyle oķer ius gencium ķat is positif is ilikned to ķre: 
to kynde rigt, 
oķer to lawe of kynde of ķe whiche it springeķ; 
to ķe comyn profit wherfore it is iordeyned; 
and to ķe men ķat schal be reweled Þerby. 
Panne lawe sch[o]lde haue [ķ]ree 
as it is ilikned to ķes ķree. 
As it is ilikned to lawe of kynde, 
it mot be rigtful; 
as it is ilikned to ķe comyn profit, 
it mot be good and profitable; 
and as it is ilikned to men 
ķat scholde be rewled Þerby, 
it mot be accordynge and couenable 
to vsage of contraye and of tyme. 
For in nedes and in dedes 
som what mot be graunted 
t o Þ e vsage of contrey and of tyme 
and to maners of man; for as suche ben diuers, 
it nedeķ to haue som diuersetee in lawes. 
Firste, lawe of mankynde ķat is positif mot be rigtful 
as it is ilikned to kynde resoun 
and to lawe of kynde. 
For but if it be rigtful, 
it is no lawe bote corupcioun of lawe; 
for no kyng is rigtfulliche iordeyned of man 
but it springe in som wise of lawe of kynde 
and but <if> kynde resoun wol ķat it be iordeyned. 
Pe seconde, lawe of men ķat is cyuel scholde be profitable 
as it is ilikned to ķe comyn profit. 
For gif ķe comyn profite is not desired in a lawe, 
it is not rigtful but euel and tyraunt lawe. 
For as a kyng is oķer ķan a tyraunt 
for a kyng is icleped rex 
and haķ ķe name of rigtful rewelynge and desireķ 
ķe comyn profit 
and a tyraunt rewlek amys and desireķ his owne profit, 
so ķe lawe of a kyng is rigtful 
in ķe whiche ķe comyn profit is desired 
and is oķer ķan ķe euel tyrauntes lawe in ķe | f. 
i whiche priuate profite is desired. 
For it nedeķ in rigtful lawes 
ķat comyn profit be desired, 
for alwey ķe ende rewle is of al oķere dedes. 
For it is comynliche iseid 
gif we desiren ķes kynges and wolle come ķerto, 
we mote do suche dedes. 
Panne lawes ķat ben rewle of oure dedes schulde be suche as nedeķ to profit 
and to ķe ende ķat is desired. 
Panne for ķe comyn profit 
is betere ķan priuat profit 
and haķ more resoun of ķe ende ķan priuat profit, 
for priuat profit is iordeyned for f ķe comyn profit f, 
it nedeķ ķat lawes be maad not suche as nedeķ for priuat profit 
but suche as nedeķ for ķe comyn profit, 
for it haķ more resoun of ķe ende. 
A n d so Þerby lawes scholde be maad and rewles of oure dedes. 
And for priuat profit is not good 
but for it is iordeyned 
for ķe comyn profit, 
for ķe partye is foule 
ķat accordeķ not to ķe hoole, 
gif eny propre profit 
is desired in lawes, 
ķat scholde not be but for so moche 
as it is iordeyned 
for ķe comyn profit. 
Pe ķridde, 
lawe as it is ilikned to ķe puple 
ķat schal be reweled 
Þerby scholde be pesible and acordyng 
to ķe contraie 
and to ķe vsage and maners of men. 
Perfore it is iseid, iiii Poleticorum, 
ķat it nedeķ not to maÞe contreyes accordynge to lawes but lawes accordynge to r Book III Part II contreys; 
and ķe lawes mot be diuerse 
by diuersete of contrées. 
Panne he ķat w o l maÞe lawe scholde besiliche 
taÞe hede of maners and condicions of men 
and geue hem suche lawes 
as hem semen spedful for hem. 
For it is iknowe what lawes and wat kynges and princes 
scholde be and ķat lawes 
scholde be made rigtful | J and profitable and accordyng col. to ķe men ķat schal be reweled Þerby, 
it may be sone iknowe ķat it is spedful to regne 
and to citee to maÞe suche lawes. 
For som men ben so good 
ķat ķei ben inclyned for honeste 
for to do vertuos worÞes 
and to leue euele worÞes. 
A n d som men ķei he be not suffisaunt of hemself 
by here owne disposicioun 
to do good and leue euele, 
gut ķei ben able to be taugt of oķere men 
and to be drawe to goode by wordes 
oķer onliche by blamynge. 
But som men ben so euel ķat ķei ben not inclyned to good of hemself oķer amended by oķere men. 
Panne namliche for suche men 
it nedeķ to maÞe lawes ķat hauen powere to constreyne 
as it is iseid, 
iiii Ethicorum. 
Panne lawes ben imaad 
as it is spedful 
ķat he be maad, 
nameliche for ķei ķat w o l lette ķe pees of citeseyns scholde for drede of payne leue to do amys. [Chapter XXVII] 
As it is declared, 
lawes ben certeyne rewles of oure dedes and ordeynek vs to ķe comyn profit and hauen power 
to compelle and constrayne. 
By tweye weyes we may preue ķat not eche man scholde maÞe lawes. 
Pe firste is itaÞe for lawes ordeynek vs to ķe comyn profit. 
Pe seconde, 
for ķei hauen power 
to compelle and constrayne. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For he ķat scholde ordeyne 
and rewle men 
to som good scholde maÞe lawes 
and rewles of dedes 
by ķe whiche men mow come to ķat good. 
Panne for ķe comyne profit 
is principaliche desired of al ķe comynte 
as of al ķe puple oķer of ķe prince 
ķat scholde | be comyn persone and solempne, 
lawes ķat ordeyneķ vs to ķe comyn profit scholde be maad of ķe prince ķat scholde ordeyne a[nd] rewle oķer men to suche good, 
oķer lawes scholde be maad of al ķe puple gif al Þe puple 
haķ ķe principate 
and haķ power to chese a prince. 
Panne no lawe is imaad 
but of hym ķat scholde rewle oķere to ķe comyn profit. 
For as ķe lawe of G 
o d and of kynde is imaad of G 
o d ķat rewlek alle kynges to hymself ward 
and is most comyn good and profit 
for he is good of alle good, 
so ķe positif lawe of mankynde is imaad of ķe prince oķer of al puple gif al ķe puple haķ ķe principate. 
Also ķe prince oķer al ķe puple gif ķei hauen principate 
scholde ordeyne and rewle oķere men to comyn profit. 
A n d eche particuler persone ķat is [/ p a r t i e ] 
of multitude sum scholde holde ķe lawes, 
but not eche persone scholde maÞe lawes. 
f. i v Pe seconde wey to preue ķe same 
is itaÞe for lawes hauen power to compelle and constreyne. 
A n d eche man of Ipe puple may warne and charge anoķer to do wel. 
Bote suche warnynges and chargynges 
ben not icleped lawes, 
for ķei mowe not compelle and constrayne. 
But strecchinge ķe name of lawe, 
eche heste and eche warnyng 
may be cleped lawe. 
A n d in ķat manere of spekynge 
as ķe philosofer seith, primo Poleticorum, 
Homērus seide ķat eche man 
maÞeķ lawes 
to children and to wyues. 
For Homērus wolde mené ķat warnynges 
and heestes ķat an housebond geueķ to wif and to children 
and to oķere of his hous mowe be cleped lawes; 
but | ķat is not 
by proper takyng of col. lawes. 
For as on singuler persone is iordeined to good and profit of an hous ķat is more hool and more comyn profit 
ķanne a singuler persone, 
so profit of an hous is iordeyned to cyuel profit <and to profit> 
of a regne ķat 
is also more hoole and more parfit. 
Wherefore gif of ķe more parfit 
ķat haķ more reson of ķe ende lawes scholde be taÞe and rewles of dedes, 
it folweth ķat not of priuat profit 
noķer of profit of hous 
but of ķe comyn profit ķat is desired 
in ķe regne and citee lawe scholde be taÞe and rewles of dedes. 
A n d for ķe housebonde noķer a priuat persone haķ power to constrayne and to compelle propreliche noķer to sie euel doers 
but a prince oķer a solempne persoun 
ķat is ouer a regne oķer a citee oķer 
ouer anoķer comynte, 
ķerfore lawes 
ķat mowe compelle and constrayne schulde not ben imaad 
bute of hym 
that is ouer the comynte 
that hath the principate of lordschipe. 
For it is iknowe ķat not eche man scholde geue lawe, 
it may be sone iknowe ķat lawe 
byndek not 
but it be publisched among ķe puple. 
For lawe is a certeyne hest of ķe souerayne 
by ķe whiche we ben ibounde 
and irewled in oure dedes, 
for ķe heste of a souereyne byndek not 
but it be iknowe to ķe sogettes. 
if a lawe schal bynde, 
it mot be ipublisched, 
icried and iknowe. 
But for lawe of kynde 
and lawe positif ben diuerse, 
ķei ben diuerseliche ipublisched and iknowe. 
For lawe of kynde 
is igeue of God 
in oure hertes, 
it is ķerfore iknowe 
in eche man 
whanne he bygynnek to knowe 
what is to doyng 
and what is not to doynge, 
[in ķat ķes] longeķ to kynde rigt. 
Bute lawe of men is promulgate and iknowe whanne it is iwrete 
and icried and declared outward. 
Panne for in rigt lawes 
ķat ben not 
con|trarie to lawes of kynde f. i stondeķ of sauacioun of regne and citee, 
kynges and princes schulde besiliche 
taÞe heede what lawes 
ķei scholde geue to here men and puple. 
But whanne lawes ben imaad and igeue 
for suche lawes scholde bynde, 
ķei scholde crie suche lawes 
and maÞe hem iknowe. 
A n d whanne ķei ben iknowe, 
maÞe hem iÞepte and iholde. 
For as ķe filosofer seiķ, Poleticorum, 
abou[t]e lawe schuld ben dubbil charge: first, r Book III Part II ķat lawis ben wel imad. 
Pe ii, ķat ķei ben wel iÞepte and iholde so 
ķat men be wel obedient to lawes ķat beķ so imaad. Chapter XXVIItl] We hauen declared in chapitres tofore what lawes kynges and princes scholde maÞe: 
rigtful lawes, profitable, and acordyng to ķe puple 
ķat schal be rewled Þerby. 
And in ķis chapitre we w o l trete whiche ben ķe effectes of lawes 
and what worÞes 
and how many suche lawes scholde conteyne. 
A n d it is iseide ķat ķe effectes of lawe by fyue, oķer fyue ben ķe worÞes of lawe: comaunde, suffre, forbede, reward, ponysche. 
A n d as it is iseid tofore, 
lawes ben certeyne rewles of oure worÞes; 
and as phisik rewlek humours of mankynde 
and maÞeķ hem euene 
by dyetynge, by drenches, 
and oķere medicines 
ķat ben conteyned in phisik: 
so by lawes and by oķere thinges 
ķat ben itaugt in ķe science of polecie 
(ķat is on rewlyng of citee and of regne), 
ķe science of polecie % wolle rewle ķe worÞes of mankynde and maÞe hem rigtful so 
ķat cite­ seyns mowe lyue rigtfulliche and wel. And aboute worÞes of mankynde 
may be double charge - 
oon whanne ķei ben to comynge 
and not gut idoo; 
I ķe oķer whanne ķei ben ido in dede. 
A n d in eiķer wise maÞers col. of lawe scholde haue charge of worÞes of mankynde. 
A n d touchynge worÞes ķat ben to comynge 
and not git idoo 
ķre longeķ to lawes: hotynge, and suffrynge, 
and forbedynge. 
A n d touch­ inge worÞes ķat ben ido in dede 
tweyne doynges longeķ to lawes: 
ponyschinge and rewardyng. 
For as it is comynliche iseide, 
worÞes of mankynde 
ben in ķre manere diuersite, 
for some ben good and vertuous; 
and som be euel; 
[and som ben mené,] 
as ķelÞe worÞes 
ķat ben of hemself indifferent, 
noķer good noķer euel. 
For manye worÞes ben of hemself 
as it were indifferent, 
noķer good noķer euel, 
ķei he mowe 
by ķe entent of hem 
ķat worchek be good oķer euel, 
to preysynge oķer to blamynge. 
As takyng vp % of a strawe fro ķe ground 
is of itself 
a work indifferent 
noķer good noķer euel, 
naķalees gif on taÞeķ 
vp a strawe wik euel entente 
as for to putte his felowe in ķe ege ķanne it is a schrewed work 
and to blamynge. 
A n d gif ķei gedren vp strawe for to maÞe clene an hous oķer to do som oķer good worÞe for ķe good entent of ķe worchere, 
ķe work ķat is of itself indifferent may be vertuous 
and to preysynge. 
Panne by ķis ķre manere of worÞes 
ķat ben to doynge ķre doynges longeķ to lawes: 
hootynge, touchynge good worÞes; 
forbedynge, touchynge euel worÞes; 
and suffrynge, touchynge worÞes 
ķat ben indiffer­ ent. 
Nathalees it is to takynge heede ķat for lawe is comynliche iset ļ to f alle men and comynliche not alle men reccheķ to ķe myddel of good­ nesse 
for not alle men mowe be parfit 
at alle poyntes, 
it longeķ to ķe v maÞere of lawe 
not onlichje to suffre indifferent worÞes 
not forbedyng 
noķer hotynge suche worÞes, 
but also it longeķ to hym to suffry suche worÞes 
ķat ben not notabliche euel. 
For gif ķe maÞere of lawe 
wolde forbede and ponysche al manere euel 
were it not so lite, 
vnneķe oķer neuere he mygte rewle eny puple. 
Perfore not onliche indifferent worÞes 
mowe be suffred 
but also ķe geuere of lawe 
may suffre worÞes of litel malice. 
For it is iknowe what longeķ to lawes 
touchynge worÞes ķat ben to doynge, 
it may be sone iknowe what longeķ ķerto. 
A n d so tweyne longeķ ķerto, 
ponyschyng and rewardynge. 
As notable euele worÞes 
scholde be forbode 
or he be do 
and iponysched whan ķei ben ido; 
and notabliche good worÞes ben counsaile 
and ihoote ar a be do 
and rewarde whanne ķei ben ido 
and not iponysched. 
Panne fyue doynges longeķ to lawes, 
tweyne touchinge good worÞes, 
hotyng ar ķei ben idoun 
and rewardyng whanne Þei ben ido; 
and tweyne touchynge euel worÞes, 
forbedyng or ķei ben ido and ponyschyng whan ķei ben ido. 
But on longeķ to lawes touching worÞes 
ķat ben indifferent oķer 
as it were indifferent, 
and ķat is suffryng. 
And for ķes ben thus itreted, 
sey we ķat kynges and princes 
ķat scholde be besy 
aboute ķe comyn profit 
and aboute | rewelyng of regne col. 
and of citee scholde 
also besiliche avise and taÞe heed what lawes 
and what statutes 
ķei setten to ķe citeseyns 
so ķat ķei scholde besiliche examine by hemself 
and by here counsaillours 
and taÞe heede what goode worÞes scholde be ihoote 
and what euel worÞes scholde be forbode and iponysched 
and what scholde be let passe and isuffred. Chapter XX[IX] The philosofer, 
iii [Poletjicorum inquirek wheÞer 
it were bettere for regne and cite 
to be rewled by ķe best kyng oķer 
by ķe beste lawe, 
and maÞen tweyne resons 
ķat it were bettere for a regne 
to be rewled 
by ķe beste lawe ķan by ķe beste kyng. 
Pe first wey is itaÞe 
for a kyng scholde be 
as it were instrument of ķe lawe. 
Pe seconde, 
for a kyng may be corupte sonere ķan ķe lawe. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For as it is iseid, 
v Ethicorum, 
a prince scholde be wardeyn 
and Þepere of rigt and of rigt lawe, 
for a good prince 
is as it were of rigt lawe 
so 
ķat what rigt lawe commaund 
eķ ķe kyng 
by ciuel powere scholde 
maÞe it be iholde and iÞept. 
Wherfore gif 
what is more principale is betere 
in rewelyng ķanne ķe instrument, 
it is bettere to be rewled 
by ķe beste lawe ķanne by ķe beste kyng. 
And so toucheķ ķe philosofer, 
iii Poleticorum, 
and seith ķat bettere it is ķat lawe haue principate ķan kynges and princes for kynges and princes scholde be ordeyned 
to be Þepers 
and seruantes of lawes. Book III Part II 
Pe seconde wey to preue ķe same is itaÞe for a kyng 
may be corrup sonnere ķan lawe. 
For a kyng is a man, 
he haķ not onlich wit 
but also wit wik desire and coueitise; 
ķei a kyng 
may not be corupte 
by witte and I vnderstondyng, 
it he may be corupte for Þey haue Þerwik desire 
f. i and coueitise. 
Perfore it is iseid, 
iii Ethicorum, 
ķat som tyme woodnesse and coueitise 
mysturnen ķe beste men [and] sleeth hem atte last. 
For ķe beste man is islawe by coueitise: 
ķei he be not islawe 
in beyng of kynde, 
nathales he is islawe in beyng ķe best; 
for whanne ķe beste man 
bygynnek to be 
w o o d and wrongfulliche coueitous, 
ķei he be not islawe 
in beynge of kynde, 
it he is islayn in beynge ķe beste 
for he is no lengere ķe beste. 
Also a kyng haķ wit 
and vnderstondynge with coueytise. 
But for lawe perteynek to resoun, 
it semeķ wit alone. 
Perfore it is iseid, 
tercio Poleticorum, 
ķat he ķat commaundeķ [ķat] wit and vnderstondyng haķ principate commandeķ ķat G o d and lawe haķ principate; 
but he [ķat] commaundeķ ķat a man be a prince, 
for coueitise, 
commaundeķ ķat a beest be prince. 
Panne by ķes resons it semeķ preued ķat bettere it 
is ķat regne 
and cite be rewled 
by lawe ķan by a kyng. 
But, iii Poleticorum, 
ķe philoso­ fer declareķ ķat ķis 
is not alwey to doynge, 
for as he seith ķe lawe seith generalliche kyng 
ķat schal not be generalliche iholde. 
For be lawes of mankynde neuere so wisliche imaad, 
ķei mot faille in som caas. 
Panne betere it is ķat a regne be rewled by a kyng ķan by lawe, 
for ķe defaute of ķe lawe 
may be mended by ķe kyng. 
Also for to knowe 
what is to spekynge in ķis matere 
it is to wetynge 
ķat a kyng and eche prince 
is mené bytwene lawe of kynde and lawe positif. 
For no man is ritful prince 
but he worche by rit resoun, 
for resoun scholde be rewelere of worÞes of mankynde. 
Where (fore a kyng col. 
is icleped rex 
and haķ ķat name of regendo, rewelynge, 
and scholde rewle oķere men 
and be rewle of oķere men. 
Panne in rewelyng oķere men a kyng scholde folwe rit resoun. 
Panne ķei scholde folwe of kynde 
ķat springeķ of ritful resoun. 
Panne in rewlyng a kyng scholde be vnder lawe of kynde 
and in so moche 
as ķei holden ķe lawe of kynde, 
he rewelek ritfulliche; 
but he is aboue lawe positif 
for he maÞeķ suche lawe 
by his owne auctorite. 
Also neuere kyng demeķ arit 
but he lyne on lawe of kynde 
and worche by rit resoun; 
so neuere lawe positif 
byndek ritfulliche 
but it lenye on auctorite 
of a kyng oķer % of anoķer prince. For, 
as it is iseid tofore, 
ritj positif and laweful haķ no diuersete 
in ķe bygynnynge 
wheÞer it scholde be in ķis wise oķer no; 
and whanne it is imaad lawe, 
ķanne it is diuerse 
by cause of auctorite of hym ķat maÞeķ ķe lawe. 
Wherfore lawe positif 
is vnder ķe prince 
as lawe of kynde is aboue hym. 
A n d gif me seith ķat som lawe positif 
is aboue ķe prince, 
ķat is not for it is positif 
but for ķerinne is som vertue of lawe of kynde. 
r Panne gif me axek 
wheÞer it is better a regne oķer a citee to be rewled 
by ķe beste kyng oķer by ķe beste lawe, 
gif we speÞen of lawe of kynde, 
it is soķ ķat ķat lawe 
is more pryncipal in rewelynge 
ķanne is ķe kyng hymsilf; 
for noon is rigtful kyng 
but in so moche 
as he lene to ķat lawe. 
Wherfore it is wel iseid, 
iii Poleticorum, 
ķat in rigtful rewelyng 
non beest scholde be prince, 
[ b u t God and v n d e r s t o n d y n g e . 
F o r p a n n e a beest is p r i n c e ^ as whanne a man fondeķ | 
not to rewle oķer by re- f. soun 
but by passioun and lust and likynge, 
in ķe whiche we accorden wik oķere bestes. 
For ķanne G o d is prince and vnderstondynge 
whan a man rewlek oķer 
by rigtful resoun 
and by lawe of kynde, 
ķe whiche lawe eche man vnderstondeķ 
by gift of God. 
But gif we speÞen of lawe positif, 
betere it is to be reweled 
by ķe beste kynge ķanne by ķe beste lawe, 
and nameliche in cases in ķe whiche suche lawes faulen and seyk generalliche kyng ķat is not iholde generalliche. 
Panne herby ķe resoun concludeķ ķat it is imaad 
for ķe contrarie ķat bettere it were to be rewled 
by a kyng ķan by lawe, 
for lawe may not determyne particuler doynges. 
Perfore it is spedful 
to a kyng 
and to oķere princes 
to rewle lawe positif 
by rigtful resoun 
and by lawe of kynde ķat G 
o d prenteķ 
in eche mannes ķougt. 
And it is spedful also for kyng and prince 
to be aboue laweful rigt ķat is positif 
and not to holde lawe where it is not to holdyng. 
Herby it may be knowe how cruelnesse and myldenesse 
m o w stonde wik rigt and with lawe. 
For by cause of particuler circumstaunces 
and of chaungynges of dedes of mankynde 
as ķe philosofer meneķ, V Ethicorum, 
dedes of mankynde 
mowe not be mete 
and imesured 
with a rewle ķat may not faille noķer bende 
as wik a rewle of yre, 
but he mot be mete and imesured wik a rewle of leed 
ķat may be aplayed 
and acordyng 
to worÞes of mankynde. 
Panne som tyme it nedeķ to bende ķe lawe toward ķe oon partie and do more myldeliche by hym ķat trespasseth ķan ķe lawe seith; 
and some tyme it nedeķ to bende lawe I toward ķe contrarie and ponysche hym ķat trespasseķ more col. greuouslicheķan ķe lawe seith. 
For particuler circumstaunces 
ķat mowe not alle be reÞened 
in ķe lawe excusek som tyme ķe trespas. 
A n d ķanne rigtfulliche 
and by resoun it is to doyng myldeliche wik hym ķat trespasseķ. 
A n d som tyme ķe circumstaunce greueķ and ķanne ķe dede scholde be ponysched wik ķe more reddor. 
Pan ķei cruelnesöe [and] myldenesse seme agenst laweful rigt and positif, nathales ķei ben not al agenst ķe lawe and rigt gif ķei ben resonablich ido 
and as circumstaunce axeth. 
Panne in demynge 
it is iseid ķat som doynge comeķ of équité 
and somme of reddor and somme of myldenesse; 
for while ķe rewle of lawe 
is rigt and euene 
and not ibend toward ķe oo partie, 
it is iseid ķat domes 
ķat ben imete 
with suche a rewle comeķ of equite. 
A n d gif for good condicions of hym ķat trespasseķ 
ķe rewle of lawe 
is ibend to ķe V Book III Part II partie of mercye, ķanne it is iseid ķat ķe rigt doom comeķ of grace and of myldenesse. 
But gif ķe forseide rewle is ibend toward ķe contrarie, 
ķanne ķe doom comeķ of cruelnesse. 
A n d for al ķees mowe be do resonabliche and rigtfulliche, 
myldenesse and cruelnesse 
mowe stonde wik rigt. Chapter XX[X] 
Som men ķer were ķat triste moche on here owne witte and seide ķat diuynyte 
is not nedful for we hauen booÞes of philosofie and science 
in ķe whiche it is itreted of alle thinges; 
and ķei menen ķat it nedeķ 
not to haue lawe of ķe gospel and of God, 
for we hauen lawe of G 
o d and of kynde | 
ķat forbedeķ al euel and comandeķ al good f. i and vertues. 
But al wikoute lawe of kynde and of men 
it is spedful to haue lawe 
of ķe gospel and of G o d . 
A n d ķat we may preue 
by ķre resons ķat ķe doctortes] 
maÞeķ comynliche. 
Pe firste is itaÞe 
by ponyschyng of synnes, 
ķe seconde by oure knowyng, 
ķe ķirdde by ķe fynal ende ķat we desiren to haue. 
Pe firste is declared in ķis wise. 
For as it is iseid tofore, 
lawe of men ponyscheth not alle synnes 
and ķat is for double cause. 
Pe firste is for comynliche ķe puple 
may not recche to ķe cheef parfitnesse of leuynge, 
ķerfore som synnes 
mot be lette passe vnponysched 
by lawe of men 
so ķat principate 
may longe dure among men. 
For it were not poscible ķat a man were % longe prince 
gif he wolde ponysche al synnes and trespaces. 
Also ķei al trespasses ķat ben iknowe mygt be iponysched of ķe prince, 
git it is not poscible ķat al trespasses ben ipunsched. 
For not alle trespasses bene iknowe to the prince %, 
for som ben so preuey as inward ķougt and likynge ķat mowe not be ponysched 
by lawe of men. 
Panne al wikoute lawe of men 
it nedeķ to haue anoķer lawe so ķat non euel be vnponysched 
noķer good vnrewarded. 
A n d herto suffiseķ 
not lawe of kynde 
as it schal be declared in ķe processe. 
Panne it nedeķ to haue lawe of ķe gospel and of G 
o d ķat forbedeķ boķe in­ ward trespas and outward, 
and ķei ķat trespassen ķeragen schal be ponesched heere oķer elles where. Herby it may be iknowe 
how lawe of man 
forbedeķ coueytise and likyng | 
and how it forbedeķ not, 
as it col. forbedeķ ķe hond 
and not ķe ķougt. 
A n d it was iseide tofore ķat ķat scholde be declared. 
Panne it is to wetynge [ķat] gif his entencioun 
ķat maÞeķ 
ķe lawe is iknowe, 
by lawe of men al synnes ben forbode oķer scholde be forbode; 
for no kyng nother maÞer of lawe haķ rigtful entent 
but his entent be to maÞe citeseyns 
as vertues as he may. 
Pan for no man comeķ to parfit vertue but his entent be forsaÞe % aile ķe forsayde euel doynges, 
gif lawe is iknowe touchynge 
th'entent of ķe maÞere of lawe, 
r it forbedeķ euele ķougtes and euel leuynge. 
And as ķe philosofer seith, 
ii J Polethicorum, 
ķere he desputeķ agenst Socrates 
by ķis manere wise, 
euel likynge is more forbode ķan outward dede; 
for outward dedes bryngen vs most to vertues gif ķei ben good 
and to vices gif ķei ben euel, 
for ķei comen of ķe innere appetite. 
But gif lawe of men 
is iknowe not touchinge his entencioun ķat maÞeķ lawe bote toching ķe ponysching, 
so it is not iseide ķat lawe forbedeķ ķougt and euel likynge 
for it 
ponyschek no suche trespace. 
And in ķis manere wise lawe of men 
not onliche forbedeķ [not] inward euel likynge, 
but also it forbedeķ 
not alle outward trespasses. 
For som tyme i n lawes of men smale trespasses 
ben ilat passe 
as it were vn­ knowe for to voyde grettere trespaces, 
as som tyme symple fornycacioun 
is ilet passe 
and not iponysched 
for to voyde greet fornicacioun and spouse breche. 
Pe seconde wey preuynge ķat it is nedful 
to haue lawe of ķe gospel and of God is itaÞe by owre knowynge | 
and by owre vncerteyne doom. 
For of particuler doynges 
ķat fallen and of dedes of mankynde 
ben so manye dyuerse domes of men 
so ķat of ķe same dedes and nedes among diuerse men ben diuerse lawes, 
and som what is rigtful 
by doom of som men 
and vnrigtful by doom of oķere men. 
Panne for i n doom of mankynde 
may falle doute and errour, 
it is spedful to haue lawe of ķe gospel 
and of God 
in ķe whiche may be non errour. 
Pe ķridde wey is itaÞe by fynal good 
ķat we desiren to haue. 
For suche good passeķ 
and is aboue ķe mygt of vs and of oure kynde, 
ķe lawe of kynde 
and ķe lawe of men 
ķat helpeķ vs to come to good 
ķat we may haue by kynde 
ben not suffisaunt to brynge vs to good 
ķat passeķ kynde. 
Panne lawe of ķe gospel and of G o d is nedful 
by ķe whiche we ben iordeyned toÞat good. 
Panne kynges and princes 
ķat scholde be 
as it were half goddes 
and haue vnderstondyng wikoute myslikynge 
and be ensample of leuynge and rewle of dedes scholde haue hemself 
so to lawe of G 
o d and to lawe of kynde and of men 
so ķat as ķei passen oķere men 
i n mygte and in dignité, 
so ķei scholde passe hem in vertue and in goodnesse. 
f. i Chapter XXX[I] Secundo Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer disputeķ agenste Ipodomus and axek gif 
it is spedful to citeseyns 
to chaunge lawes of ķe cuntrey 
and to brynge in newe vsages. 
A n d as it is iseid tofore, 
Ipodomus ordeynede ķat he ķat fondeķ eny lawe profitable 
for a citee scholde haue | wor- col. schep in ķat cite. 
A n d for comynliche men desiren worschep, 
manye were imeued and fonde vp manye newe vsages and seide ķat ķei were profitable for a citee and vndede so 
ķe olde lawes of ķe contrey. 
Panne ķe doute 
is wel iaxed wheÞer ķe menyng of Ipodomus 
be good and gif v Book III Part II 
it is spedful 
ofte to chaunge lawes 
also ķei we se lawes 
ķat semeķ more profitable and bettre. 
A n d ķe philosofer in Poleticorum 
maÞeķ foure resouns 
by ķe whiche it semeķ ipreued ķat it is spedful to chaunge lawes. 
First is itaÞe by science and art, 
ķe seconde by schrewednesse of som lawes, 
ķe ķridde by symplenesse of maÞers of lawes, 
ķe ferķe by vncerteyn particuler circumstaunces. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wise. 
In oķer doynges we seen ķat gif ķe lattere men seen 
ķe bettere menyng, 
ķe menyng of ķe raķere men is reproued. 
As in phesik moche menyng of oolde men is forsaÞe; 
and in craft of wrastelyng, 
as ķe philosofer meneķ in Poletikys, 
many thinges ķat olde men 
taugte ben renewed 
and ichaunged by newe men. 
Wherfore so he seith ķat it scholde be in lawes 
ķat gif we seen bettere, 
lawes of contre scholde 
no lengere be hoolde. 
Pe seconde wey to preue ķe same 
is itaÞe by schrewednesse of som [lawes]. 
Lawes of contray may be euel 
as ķe philosofer meneķ, 
as lawes of barbares; 
as som tyme among ķe Grees 
was a lawe ķat ķei ķat bare ire and oķer metal 
bougte wyues eche of oķer. 
A n d it is in alle wyse barbari 
and vnskylful to ordeyne lawes 
ķat citeseyns mygte selle here wyues. 
Also summe | lawes ben nyce 
as ķe lawe ķat ķe philosofer meneķ f. i and reherseķ ķat som men made: 
ķat gif a citeseyn were islawe 
and eny of his kyn wolde rese on eny citeseyne, 
gif ķat citeseyn wolde flee for eny presumpcioun 
he scholde be holde gulty of ķe deeķ. 
For ķe maÞere of lawe seide 
ķat he wolde not flee 
but assay hymself gilty. 
But it is folye to ordeyne suche lawe; 
for whether a man be gilty oķer no, 
gif he drede to be wounded 
it is kyndeliche 
ķat he flee 'hem ķat 'hym pursewek %. 
Panne for som lawes of contrey ben schrewed and nyse, 
ķei scholde be chaunged. 
Pe ķridde wey is itaÞe 
by symplenesse of maÞers of lawes. 
For som tyme maÞers of lawes 
ben symple men 
ofwitte and of cunnynge, 
ķanne it were vnresonable but wise men 
ķat comen afterward mygte chaunge lawes of contrey ķat ben imaad by symple men. 
Panne in suche a caas lawes 
of oolde tyme scholde be changed. 
Pe ferķe is itaÞe 
by vncerteyn particuler circumstaunces. 
For particuer dedes ben vncerteyne 
and mowe not be parfitliche ireÞened, 
ķerfore by ķe maÞers 
of lawe neuere so wise, 
gut som particuler circumstance of dedes of mankynde 
may be vnknowe to hem. Panne gif 
by cause of experience of particuler dedes newe men seen 
som what ķat is bettere, 
it is not inconuenyent 
to putte of olde lawes 
of contrey for newe lawes 
ķat ben bettre. 
And so it semeķ ķat ķes resons preuen ķat 
as ofte as eny better kyng comeķ to mynde, 
lawes of contrey scholde be chaunged. 
But symple affirmyng herof 
is perilous to reg |ne and to citee; 
for as ķe philosofer col. seith, ii Poleticorum, 
it is al oon to vse to brynge in newe lawes 
and r to vse 
to be not obedient to lawes, 
for lawes hauen greet strengte of vsage 
and it is hard to do agenst kyng ķat is ivsed and iholde long tyme. 
And vsyng to be not obedient to lawes 
is vsyng 
to be not obedi­ ent to kynges and princes, 
and so it is destroyeng 
of principate of ķe regne. 
And how gret harme gif 
we be not obedient to princes 
Ipe philos­ ofer preueķ, 
i Rethoricorum, 
and seith ķat we doun more harme gif 
we be not obedient to princes 
ķan we don gif we ben not obedient to phisicians, 
for phisicians desiren good and profit for ķei willen hele ķe body. 
But verrey geueres of lawe 
and verrey kynges desiren profit of ķe soule 
and to brynge citeseyns to vertues. 
Panne for to knowe 
what is ķe holdynge in ķe doute 
ķat is iaxed, 
it is to wetynge 
ķat gif lawe positif is rigtful, 
ķei mot lenye 
on lawe of kynde 
and determyne particuler doynges. 
And suche a lawe may faille in tweye manere wise: 
first, gif it is contrarie to lawe of kynde; 
ķe seconde, 
gif it determynek not suffisauntliche particuler dedes. 
if positif lawes of contrey faillen in ķe firste manere, ķanne ķei ben not lawe 
but corupcioun of lawes 
and ķerfore ķei scholde be not holde. 
For Þeyg positif lawes be ido 
to lawes of kynde, 
gut Þey ben not contrarie to lawes of kynde 
but we wolde clepe contrarie 
to lawe of kynde 
what is not gift of kynde 
but ido ķerto and ifounde 
by crafte of men. 
By ķe whiche manere of spekynge 
man is kyndeliche naÞed and clokyng is agenst kynde, 
for to be icloķed 
and be naÞed semeķ contrarie. 
| 
And legistres vsen ķis maner of spekyng 
as it is iwrete, 
ex Institūta, De Iure Naturali, 
where it is iseid 
ķat lawes of men 
ben contrarie to lawes of kynde. 
For by lawe of kynde 
alle men seķķe ķe worlde 
was first ymaad were ibore fre. 
Panne ķraldom is agenste kynde, 
for it is not ķe gift of kynde 
but it is iordeyned 
by lawes for profit of men. 
But it is al oon to clepe so a kyng agenste kynde 
and to speÞe bostersliche, 
for ķat is propreliche agenst kynde 
ķat is agenst kynde resoun. 
For by cause of comyn profit of men 
ķraldom is ibrougt in, 
as we preuede tofore in ķe seconde book. 
Som men seruen oķere and ben obedient ķei it be do to lawe of kynde 
as clokynge is ido to ķe naÞed body 
ķat is ibrougt fork by kynde. 
Natheles clokynge 
is not agenste lawe of kynde for kynde resoun wikseik it not. 
Panne lawes ķat faillen for ķei ben schrewede oķer agenst lawe of kynde 
as ķat lawe was ķat citeseyns mygte selle here wifes, 
and alle oķere lawes 
ķat ben schrewede and vnrigtful, 
scholde not be hoolde but destroyed and vndo. 
But gif lawes failleķ 
for he determynek not completliche particuler 
dedes ķei better lawes ben ifounde and more suffisaunt, 
it is not to vsynge to chaunge lawes. First, 
for som tyme in suche doynge isdeseite, 
for beste lawes 
ben itrowed worst 
and most suffisaunt ben itrowed lest f. i v Book III Part II suffisaunt. 
Nathalees Þey more suffisaunt lawe 
in som poynt be neweliche ifounde, 
ut olde lawes of contray scholde be holde; 
for ķe more oon profite in oo side | 
in euynge more suffisant lawe, 
Ipe more he col. anoyek in anoķer side, 
bynemynge ķerof vsage of longe tyme 
by ķe whiche lawe haķ greet strengķe. 
Panne it is not iliche of art and of lawes, 
for art and science hauen al here strengķe of resoun; 
but lawes not so, 
but hauen strengķe of vsage of long tyme. 
Panne kynges and princes scholde Þepe 
and hoolde good vsages of principate and of regne 
and [not] of chaungyng of lawes of contrayes 
but ķei ben contrarie 
to n e t f u l resoun. Chapter XXXI[I] 
In matere of rewelyng of regne and cite, 
as it is iseid tofore, 
foure were to tretyng: 
what manere man a kyng oķer a prince scholde be, 
what counsaillours, what iuges, 
and what manere puple. 
Panne for ķe ķre ben isped, 
it is to spekynge of ķe ferķe ķat is ķe puple. 
But for to knowe what manere puple ķe puple scholde be 
and how ķei scholde bere hemself to ķe prince, 
it helpeķ gretliche to wete and knowe 
what is a cite 
and what is a regne. 
It is oure entente to declare in ķis chapitre 
what is a citee 
and what is a regne ļ . 
For euery man 
may wel wete ķat houses 
maÞeķ toun and townes 
maÞen ķe règnes. 
A n d it is to wetynge ķat ķei a citee be in som wise 
som what kyndelich for we hauen kynde desire to maÞe a citee, 
it is not a cite imade 
noķer ibulde 
[but] 
by wit and work of mankynde. 
A n d kynges ķat ben imaad 
be work of mankynde 
and ben iknowe 
by ķe ende 
and profit for ķe whiche it is iordered. 
A n d principaliche we knowen 
what is an hous gif we knowen 
ķat it is imaad 
for ķis profitable ende 
for to defende vs fro reyne, 
fro coold, 
and fro heete. 
Wherfore if we wolle knowe 
what is a citee, 
ķe profites wherfore | it serueķ to bulde a cite scholde be reÞened 
and it scholde be knowe 
whiche is ķe cheef profit 
among ķilÞe profites. 
And ķe philosofer, [ i i i ] Poleticorum, 
discreueķ 
what is a citee 
and reÞeneķ sex profites 
wherfore a citee is iordeyned. 
For first, a citee is iordeyned 
for communicacioun of place 
ķat men mowe wonye togedre. 
For ķerof ļ comeķ likynge and murķe, 
for with­ oute companye no man haķ murķe of possessioun. 
For if a man hadde moche gold and seluer 
and alle manere vitailles 
and leuede wikoute companye 
so ķat oķir men knowe not his richesse noķer he mit comyn his richesse to oķer men, 
ķei wolde not telle gret pris of his richesse. 
Pan cite is imaad for men 
scholde dwelle togeders 
in oon place and lyue in murķe and in likynge. 
Pe seconde, 
a citee is imaad 
not onliche for to lyue in murķe and in likynge, 
but for ķe silue lyuynge. 
For men ķat ben in ķe same citee 
f. i r seruen eche oķer to ķe lif 
and eche helpeķ oķer in kynges ķat nedeķ to ķe lif. 
Pe ķridde, 
a citee is imaad for defence and for to putte of wrong. 
For oon man leuynge solitarie lif is not suffisant 
to wikstonde enemyes 
and to voide wrong 
ķat hym is idoo, 
a citee is imaad: 
for oon ķat lyuek solitarie lif may not defende hymsilf fro enemyes. 
Y f he is part of ķe multitude of ķe citee, 
he may lyue saufliche 
and wikoute drede. 
Pe ferķe, 
a citee is iordeyned for chaungynge 
and for contractes. 
For it is iseide tofore ķere we tretede of lawes 
ķat chaungynges and contractes ben imaad 
by ķe lawe ķat hatte ius gencium, 
and makynge of chaungynges 
and contractes longeķ propreliche to mankynde. 
A n d for no man [haķ] alle | thinges ķat nedeķ 
to ķe lif 
but he chaunge col. 
som thinges ķat he haķ for thinges ķat ben not, 
ķerfore byggyng and sellyng, chaungynges and contractes, 
ben nedful and ben aile ķe eslichere ido gif men dwellen ifere. 
Perfore a citee is imaad for men scholde dwelle ifere. 
Pe fifte profit wherfore a citee is imaad 
is communicacioun of wedlok. 
For men ķat wonyen togeders 
ben frendes and louen ķe bettre eche oķer, 
oķer for som oķer good ķat ķei seen come ķerof, 
a J maÞen contracte of manages and ben alyes. 
Pe sexte profit wherfore a citee is imaad is free and vertuous leuynge. 
For ķei mowe bettere ponysche hem 
ķat trespassen and ben euel doers 
if ķei wonyen ifeere in a citee 
ķanne ķei myte an J ķei wonyed disparpuled 
and ladde solitarie lyf, 
ķanne ķerfore it is ķat manye leuen euel doynge 
and vsen good worÞes and doynge for drede of payne; 
and in Þat doynge ķei ben disposed to bee good men and vertuous, 
for vertues and vertuous dedes ben most good. 
Pei [for] aile ķe forsayde profites 
in som wyse a citee is imaad, 
ut a citee is pri[ncipal]liche imaad for free and vertuous leuynge. 
Wherfore gif of ķe moste ķe cheef ende 
and of ķe most profit ķat is desired 
in a kyng knowynge is itaÞe, 
it is wel iseid, 
iii Poleticorum, 
ķat ny place, comunicacioun of wedlok, deffence, chaungynge of thinges, 
and of oķere suche ben ķe thinges 
withoute ķe whiche a citee scholde not be. 
Nathalees a citee is principalliche imaad 
for to lyuye wel and vertuous and in félicitée. 
Panne gif me axek 
what is a citee, 
it schal be seid ķat it is comunicacioun of citeseyns | for to lyue wel and vertuouslyche i 
and for profit 
and by itself suffisaunt lyuynge. 
For it is iknowe wat is a citee, 
it may be sone iknowe 
what is a regne. 
For a regne passeÞ a citee 
in multitude of gentel men and noble. 
A n d a citee 
is a partye of a regne, 
and in a regne ben mo gentil men and noble ķan in a citee. 
Panne a regne 
may be discreued 
in ķis wise ķat it is a greet multitude 
in ķe whiche ben manye gentil men and noble, 
leuynge by vertue, 
ordeyne vnder oon ķe beste, 
as vnder a kyng. 
v Book III Part I I 
And leuynge by vertues [is] ķe ende principaliche desired 
in eche cite­ seyn 
and in eche citee and in ķe hoole regne. 
For ķe philosofer seith ķat ķe same is ķe ende of on citeseyn 
and of al ķe hoole [ 
c i t e e , 
we m a y saye 
p a t pe same 
is o f o n citee 
and o f al pe hoole] regne. 
For a verrey kyng 
and a rigtful schal desire 
ķe same ende in oon cite­ seyn and in al Þe hoole citee and in al ķe hoole regne. 
For ķei scholde besiliche Studie 
Þat a citeseyne leuye vertuousliche and Þat al Þe hoole citee be vertuous 
and ķat al ķe hool regne be good and vertuous. 
But gif eche citeseyne scholde be vertuous, 
moche more a kyng scholde be vertuous. 
For ķe philosofer seith, iii Poleticorum, 
ķat as a kyng passeķ oķere men 
in mygt and i n dignité, 
so ķei scholde passe hem i n good­ nesse 
and i n vertue. 
Panne gentil men 
and noble scholde be more vertuous 
ķan oķere men. 
Perfore ķe kyng hymself as most excellent of alle scholde be ķe beste and an half god. 
And ķerfore it is ķat regne 
is icleped a multitude in ķe whiche ben manye gentel men and noble not leuynge i n al maner wise 
but leuynge 
by vertue and ordeyne | 
vnder col. 
oon man ķat is best as vnder a kyng. 
For it is declared 
what is a citee 
and what is a regne, 
it may be sone iknowe what puple scholde be in ķe regne 
and i n a citee. 
For gif citee and regne is iordeyned 
for good lif and vertuous, ķe puple of ķe regne scholde be good and vertuous. 
Perfore ķe philosofer seith, 
i i i Polet­ icorum, 
ķat he is more verrey citeseyn 
ķat haķ many good worÞes and vertuous 
ķan he ķat haķ greet richesse and noble kyn 
and oķer out­ ward good. 
And manye trowen 
ķat ķei ben citeseyns of ķe regne gif ķei hauen in ķe regne manye hous and greet possessioun; 
but ķei ben more verreyliche of ķe regne ķat doķ 
manye good dedes and vertues 
and holdeķ rigtful lawes and statutes of ķe regne ķanne ķei ķat hauen noble kyn and cyuel mygt and power and moche outward good. Chapter XXXIItl] Qvarto Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer seith ķat 
i n a citee mot be ķre partees, 
for som ben ful riche 
and somme ful poore 
and somme mené men. 
A n d in ķis wise 
as a citee is deuyded in ķre parties, 
so may eche puple 
and eche regne % be deuyded. 
Pe entencioun of ķis chapitre 
is to declare ķat a citee is best 
and a regne is best gif among ķ e puple ķerof bene manye mené persones. 
And, iiii Poleticorum, 
ķe philosofer toucheķ foure 
by ķe whych may be tak iiii weyes to preue ķat politik is ķe bettere 
and a regne is ķe better 
and a cite is ķe bettere gif ķerin ben mani mené persones. 
Pe firste wey is itaÞe for suche puple 
leuen ķe more resonabliche. 
Pe seconde, 
for among hem scholde be ķe more loue. 
Pe ķridde, 
for ķer is ķe more | équité. 
Pe ferķe, 
for ķer is ķe lasse envye 
and ķe lasse despisyng. 
f. i r Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For gif in ķe puple 
is many ful poore 
and many fui riche 
and fewe mené persones, 
vnneķe or neuere ķei leuen resonablelyche. 
For ful riche men 
conne not bere hemself resonableliche to fui pore men, 
for ķei greuen hem openliche for litel occasioun. 
Also fui pore men cunne not bere hemself resonabliche to fui riche men 
for ķei leyen in awaite 
in what wise ķei mowe sleliche and preueyliche 
stele heere good and catel. 
But gif ķer be in ķe puple manye mené persones, 
suche greef ceseķ 
and ķei ben sone obedient to resoun. 
And so it is iseid, 
iiii Poleticorum, 
ķat for mené is best, 
mené is best possessioun 
for it is sone obedient to resoun. For gif on partie of a citee is passyng gentil and noble and passyng mygty and passyng riche 
and ķe oķer partie contrarieķ ķerto is passynge nedy and passynge feble 
and swyÞe vnworthi, 
it is hard to folwe resoun. 
For ķe passyng mygty men 
wolde do wrong 
to ķe pore men, 
<and> ķe pore men 
ben ful wikÞed and gileful and lyen priueyliche 
on awayte on riche men. 
Pe seconde wey is itaÞe by comune loue ķat scholde be bytwene hem 
ķat ben in ķe regne 
or in ķe same cytee. 
For as it is iseid, 
iiii Eth­ icorum, ķe pore men louen not ķe princes 
and mygti men and riche, 
and ķis is ful greuous 
to a cytee 
as it is iseid ķere. 
Panne for to haue loue 
bytweyne citeseyns, 
it is good ķat among ķe puple ben manye mené persones. 
Pe ķridde wey ļ is itaÞe 
by equite and rigtwisnesse 
ķat scholde be col. 
Þepte in ķe citee. 
For as ķe philosofer seith, 
ķei ķat passen in fortune, 
in mygt, in richesse, 
and in frendschipe, 
and in oķer suche good connen not be söget. 
A n d ķei ķat ben passynge 
nedy conneķ not be princes. 
Wherfore gif in ķe puple 
ben onliche twey parties, 
to pore and to riche and fewe oķere non mené persones 
it is hard to Þepe equyte and rigtwisnesse; 
but ķe riche wollek alwey be princes 
and ouersette ķe oķere, 
and ķe oķere agenward fondeķ to maÞe discencioun and strif. 
A n d gif it happe ķat pore men ben princes, 
for ķei konneķ not be princes, 
ķei wollen trete wel euel ķe riche men and mygty. 
Pe ferķe wey is itaÞe 
for to putte of enuye and despite. 
For as it is iseid, 
iiii Poleticorum, 
pore men hauen most enuye to riche men and riche men 
hauen most despit of pore men, 
and [none] companye may dure ķere 
is greet enuye and despit. 
Wherfore ķe puple 
is best gif ķerinne ben manye mené persones, 
for ķanne ķei lyuen togedres resonabliche and louyen eche oķer and Þepen 
among hem equite and rigtwisnesse. 
A n d noon enuye 
is among hem noķer despit, 
for noon haķ cause to despite oķer noķer to haue enuye to oķer, 
seynge ķat he is 
as it were his peere 
and among hem oon passeķ not gretliche anoķer. 
And to ķis soķnesse 
acordeķ ķe loore ķat Saloun and Carendas and Ligurigus techeķ of polecies, 
for ķei seide ķat policies and comyntee scholde be ordeyned of mené persones. Book III Part II 
Panne kynges and princes scholde ordeyne ķat in ķe regne scholde | 
f. be manye mené persones 
lest som men be to pore and somme to riche. 
And ķat may be gif ķe citeseyns 
scholde not for eche cause selle here 
fader poscessions noķer for eche cause bygge possessions. 
if good heede is bysiliche itaÞe of byggyng 
and sellynge of fildes, 
som manere equite may be Þepte among citeseyns. 
v Chapter XXX[IV] 
As it longeķ to ķis doynge ķe puple haķ ķre gif he is with greet besinesse 
obedient to kynges and princes and Þepeķ and holdeķ lawes of kynges, 
of ķe whiche ķre by ķre weyes we may preue how profitable and spedful it is to ķe puple 
to be obedient to kynges 
and to Þepe here lawes. 
A n d first, 
Þerby ķe puple haķ vertues 
and most good and profit. 
Pe seconde, ķerof comeķ sauacioun of regne and of citee. 
Pe ķridde, 
ķerof comeķ pees and ese of citeseyns 
and píente of outward kynges. 
Pe firste wey is declared in ķis wise. 
For, as it is iseid tofore, 
his entencioun ķat maÞeķ lawe 
is for to brynge citeseyns to vertue. 
And as ķe philosofer meneķ, 
iiii Poleticorum, circa principium, 
ķe same is ķe vertue 
of a good citeseyn 
and of a good man. 
And by ķe same doynge 
and by ķe same Þewes 
a man 
is a good citeseyn and a good man. 
A n d a man 
is a good citeseyn gif 
he is obedient to ķe prince 
and to hym ķat geueķ lawes. 
Wherfore gif ķe prince 
rewlek his puple arigt, 
for his entent is to brynge oķere men to vertu for vertue maÞeķ a man good 
and his work good, 
it nedeķ in rigtful rewelyng 
ķat a good citeseyn be a good man; 
and he ķat is wel obedient 
to ķe kyng is a good man. 
And I gif ķe kyng desireķ 
not ķat his sogettes 
ben gode and vertuous, 
col. ķan he is no kyng 
but a tyrant. 
Panne gif eche citesein scholde desire 
to be good and vertuous, 
for vertues ben most good, 
ķei schold with most besynesse Studie 
to be obedient to ķe kyng 
and to be so ware 
ķat he brek not his lawes and his hestes. 
A n d to al men boķe worthi and vnworthi ķe kynges obedience is nedful and Þepyng of lawes. 
And ķe more semelich it is ķat noble men 
ben good and vertuous, 
ķe more spedful it is ķat ķei be obedient to kynges and Þepe ķe lawes. 
Pe seconde wey to preue ķe same is itaÞe 
for of ķe kynges 
obedience 
and of Þepyng of lawes 
comyk sauacion of regne and of cite. 
For it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
ķat in lawes is sauacioun of citées. 
And som men trowen ķat Þepyng of lawes 
is a certeyn ķraldome. But ķe philoso­ fer, 
v Poleticorum, 
seith ķat [it is n o p r a l d o m b u t f r e d o m . 
F o r men k n o w e p 
n o t f r e d o m p 
a t say en p a t Þepe lawes a n d ] be obedient to kynges is [/] ķraldom. 
A n d for bestes ben of ķral kynde, 
ķe more a man drawek to bestial 
kynde he is ķe more kyndeliche ķral. 
A n d ķe philosofer meneķ and Homērus also Þat he ķat is euel doere and desireķ werre and disturbleķ ķe pees 
and w o l lyue withoute souereyne 
and withoute lawe is more verreyliche 
a beest ķan a man. 
Wherfore he ķat Þepeķ not lawes noķer 
w o l be obedient to lawes 
and to souereynes 
ben more verreyliche beestes ķan men, 
[and Þerby suche ben more ķral ķan free]. 
Also sauacioun is isaued, 
and men of ķe regne ben imaad free gif ķei ben obedient to kynges 
and Þepeķ ķe lawes. 
How greet sauacioun springeķ 
in ķe regne of ķe kynges obedience it is declared atte fülle gif ķe wordes of ķe philosofer, 
iiii Poleticorum, 
ben iknowe ķat likneķ ķe kyng to ķe regne 
as | ķe soule to ķe body. 
f. io For as 
.Þe soule rewlek and saueķ ķe body, 
so ķe kyng rewlek and saueķ ķe regne. 
A n d as ķe soule is sauacion 
and lif of ķe body, 
so a rigtful kyng is sauacion 
and lif of ķe regne. 
Wherfore [as it is] worst to Þe body 
[to] forsaÞe Þe [soule] 
and not be rewled Þerby, 
so it is worst to ķe regne 
to forsaÞe kynges lawes and heeste of lawes 
and not be rewled by ķe kyng. 
Pe ķridde wey to preue ķe same is itaÞe for [of] ķe kynges 
obedience and of Þepynge of lawes springeķ pees and ese of citeseyns and píente of outward kynges. 
For, 
as it is iseid tofore, lawes and maÞers 
of lawes and kyng and prince hauen power 
to compelle and constrayne hem 
ķat wolle not for loue of honeste noķer for warnynge noķer for reprouynge of fader and moder noķer of oķere frendes withdrawe hem 
fro euele dedes, 
ķei scholde wikdrawe hem ķerfro nameliche for drede. 
And it is spedful to regne and cyte to haue a kyng oķer a prince leste euel doers 
disturble pees of citeseyns. 
A n d eche maÞere of lawe scholde desire 
ķat citeseyns 
haue ese of herte and ķat ķei leue in pees 
and by oon assent. 
And ķerfore it is ķat ķe philosofer, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
w o l mené ķat as maÞers of lawe hauen hem to ķe soûles 
as phisicians hauen hem to ķe bodyes. 
For as phisicians desiren to abate humoures 
lest siknesse come ķerof in ķe body, 
so ķe maÞere of lawe desireķ to plese ķe hertes and .sowles for strif and discord scholde not arise in regne noķer in citee. 
And ķerfore it is iseid, 
primo Rethoricorum, 
Þat he | Þat haķ coi. 
trespassed agenst 
.hestes of Þe phisician doķ 
not so greet synne 
as he ķat vseķ 
to be not obedient to ķe prince. 
For ķe soule is bettre ķan ķe body, 
and pees of citeseyns 
and of hem ķat ben in ķe regne 
is better ķanne euennesse of humours 
oķer heele of bodies. 
Panne with most besynesse ķe puple 
and alle men of ķe regne scholde be obedient to ķe kyng 
and Þepe lawes, 
for ķerof comeķ so greet good and profit 
as is pees and ese of hem 
ķat ben in ķe regne. 
Also ķerof comeķ píente of outward thinges. 
For gif ķer is werre in ķe regne, 
lond is vnteeled 
and ķer is ryflyng and robberye 
and lond is bareyne and men of ķe regne 
ben imaad pore and nedy. 
if ķanne it is iknowe 
how greet profit comeķ 
to regne of a kyng, 
not oonliche to rigtful kynges 
but also ķei he do som tyraundise, 
gut ķe puple scholde be obedient to hem. 
For som what of tyraundise 
may be bettre isuffred r Book III Part II ķan ķe harm ķat comeķ 
if men ben vnobedient to ķe prince 
and breÞen his lawe. Chapter XXX[V] 
After ķat we hauen itaugt Þe puple 
and alle men of a regne 
to be obedient to kynges 
and to Þepe here lawes, 
in ķis chapitre we wolle declare how men of a regne scholde bere hemself 
so ķat kynges be not meued 
to wrathe agenst hem. 
Pe philosofer, 
in principio [ii] Reth­ oricorum, 
seith ķat wrathe is sorwe comyng of appetite of semynge ponysschyng, 
for semynge despite of hem 
ķat hauen mysbore hem to hym, 
oķer to som of his. 
For neuere is wrathe wikoute som manere sorwe. 
A n d he ķat is | wrook desireķ to ponysche oponliche hem ķat f. o despisen hym, 
oķer som of his, 
oķer eny thing 
ķat longeķ to hym in eny wise. 
Panne as ķe philosofer seith, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
whanne a man is sory agenst 
anoķer in eny of ķees forseide maneres be desire of ponyschyng, 
it is iseid ķat he is wrook. 
Also citeseyns, 
for ķei scholde not meue kynges to wrathe, 
ķei scholde not trespace agenste ķe kyng, 
noķer agenst his, 
noķer agenste thinges 
ķat longeķ to hym in eny wise. First, 
it is spedful to hem ķat ben in ķe regne, 
for ķei scholde not offende ķe kyng, 
to do no trespas agenst ķe kyng. 
For tweyne ben thewe to ķe kyng, 
worschep and obedience. 
For a kynge is an heed ilikned to oķere membres 
in twey manere wise. First, 
for he is heighere 
and more excellent ķan oķere. 
Pe seconde, 
for ķei rewelen oķere 
in worÞes and in dedes. 
Also, 
for he maÞeķ lawes 
and for in a kyng scholde be wit and vnderstondynge; 
and to hym it longeķ most by hymself 
and by oķere to rewle hem ķat ben in ķe regne. 
Panne for he is more excellent ķan oķere, 
ķei scholde haue worschep and reuerence; 
and for he rewl­ ek oķere, 
oķere scholde be sogette and obedient to hym. 
Wherfore ķei ķat ben in ķe regne mowe trespace agenst ķe kyng 
in twey man­ ere wise. First, gif ķei doun 
hym not worschip and reuerence 
as ķei scholde. 
Pe seconde, gif ķei ben not söget and obedient to hym 
Þepyng his lawes and heestes. 
A n d whanne ķes tweyne, 
worschep and obedi­ ence, 
ben wikdrawe ķe kyng, 
ķanne he is skilfulliche wrooth. Perfore it is iseid, ii Rethoricorum, 
ķat we | ben wrook to hem ķat were iwoned col. 
oķer iholde to do vs worschep gif ķei doun vs noon. 
A n d ķe cause is for it semeķ ķat ķei ķat doun so despisen vs. 
For gif ķei despisen vs not, 
ķei wolde do vs worschep 
as ķei scholde. 
Also ķere it is iseyd 
ķat we ben wrothe with lowere men gif ķei doun not 
as ķei scholde and gif ķei doun oķer wise ķanne Þey scholde. 
A n d ķat happeķ most gif ķei trespassen agenste hestes of souereynes and ben not obedient to ķe kyng. 
v For it is iknowe how men of ķe regne scholde not meue ķe kyng to wrathe - 
trespassynge agenst hym, 
not doynge hym worschip and obedience 
as ķei scholde - 
it is to declarynge how Þey scholde not meue hym 
to wrothe trespassynge agenste hem ķat ben his and longeķ to hym. 
A n d to hym longeķ diuerse persons, 
fader and moder 
and al his kyn, 
wif and children and sogettes. 
Also gif men of ķe regne 
wolle not meue ķe kyng to wrathe, 
ķei scholde not onliche not trespace agenst hemself 
but also ķei scholde not trespace agenst his kyn, wif, children, 
noķer agenst his sogettes. 
A n d for aile ķat ben in ķe regne īo ben söget to ķe kyng, 
it is trespace agenst ķe kyng 
as ofte as eny in ķe regne haķ eny wrong. 
And so it is iseide, 
i i Rethoricorum, 
capitulo De Ira, 
ķat we ben wrothe wik hem 
Þat trespassen to oure fader and moder, children, wyues, and sogettes, 
for it is schame

Pe ķridde, 
men of ķe lond scholde not trespasse in kynges ķat ben iordeyned to Þe kyng 
in eny manere wyse, 
and suche kynges 
ben his owne possessions 
and rigtes of ķe regne. 
For a kyng is meued to |

Þat bynemen rigtes of Þe regne 
for in ķat it semeķ 
ÞatÞei despisen ķe kyng 
gif ķei setten hond in thinges 
ķat longeķ

Panne alle citeseyns

scholde in child­ hood teche here children

and to be obedient to hym 
and not trespace

For alwey we louen ķe firste moste, 
and children ben most inclined

ķat Þey lernen first. Chapter XXXV[I] 
For in ķe firste book we byhigte 
Þat we wolde speÞe how kynges and princes scholde bere hemself for to be loued of ķe puple 
and how for to be dradde, 
heere we w o l trete how 
and in what wise ķat may be doo. 
And so it is to wetynge ķat to maÞe kynges and princes comynliche be loued of ķe puple ķre nedeķ principalliche. Firste, ķat ķei ben fre of giftes and liberal. 
Pe seconde, ķat ķei be stalworthe and worschepful. 
Pe ķridde, ķat ķei be rigtful. 
Pe firste is declared in ķis wise. 
For ķe comune puple faren 
as ķei han perseyued not but sencible good, 
and louyen and worschepen hem ķerfore ķat ge|uen giftes and ben liberal 
and geuen money and col. monyes worth. 
Perfore it is iseid,

ķat ķe puple loueķ and worschepek hem ķat geueķ giftes and moneye and ben liberal.

for to be loued of ķe puple kynges scholde be fortes, stalworthe, and magnanimi, 
and putte hemself gif it nedeķ to peril 
for ķe comyn profit 
and for ķe defence of ķe regne. 
For ķe puple louen wel stalworthe men 
and worschepful 
ķat putteķ hemself to peril 
for ķe comyn profit 
and trowen ķat here sauacioun [comeķ] be suche men. 
Perfore it is iseid,

ķat we louen hem 
Þat geuen giftes to sauacioun and hem 
Þat mowe do vs good 
and saue vs and delyuery vs. 
Perfore we louyen men 
ķat ben stalworde and bolde. 
Pe ķridde, 
for to be loued of ķe puple kynges scholde be rigtful. 
For ķe puple is most imeued 
to hate gif ķei seen 
ķat ķe kyng is not rigtful. 
Perfore it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
Þat we louyen rigtful men best. 
For it is iknowe how kynges and princes scholde bere hemself 
for to be loued of ķe puple, 
it is to tretynge how ķei scholde bere hemself 
to be drad of ķe puple. 
A n d as it is iseid, 
[ii] Rethoricorum, 
princes ben most idrad for ponyschyng 
Þat ķei vsen in sogettes. 
And in ponyschyng ķre mote be knowe: 
Þe peyne silf, 
Þe persone ķat is iponysched, 
[and] ķe manere of ponyschyng. 
Touchinge ķe payne, 
kynges and princes ben idrad 
gif ķei peynen hym cruelliche ķat disturblen 
ķe regne ļ ouer mesure and ķe policie f. and rewelyng. 
Perfore it is iseid, 
ii Rethoricorum, 
ķat men dreden hem 
ķat [ķei] trowen ķat vsen to do here doynge [hard] and cruel. Pe seconde, kynges and princes ben idrad not oonliche for ķe peyne ķat Þey geuen 
but also for ķe persones 
ķat ben iponysched. 
For by cause of rigtwisnesse 
ķe rigtful man scholde no man spare. 
Perfore it is iseid, 
vii Poleticorum, 
ķat he ķat doķ wel spareth no man; 
for not for fader noķer for sone noķer for frend noķer for oķer scholde men spare to do wel. 
A n d kynges and princes ben ydrad 
by cause of persones 
ķat ben yponysched 
whanne ķei sparen not frendes noķer oķer gif ķei trespassen, for ķanne eche of ķe puple dredeķ to trespace and ķynÞeķ ķat Þey may not scape ķe peyne. 
But as ķe philosofer meneķ, 
vii Poleticorum, 
for kynges scholde be ķe more idrad and Þepe ķe more strongliche rigtwisnesse, 
kynges and princes scholde ponysche more cruelliche here owne frendes gif ķei doun greet trespace ķan oķere men. 
Pe ķridde, kynges and princes ben idrad 
for ķe manere of ponysch­ yng. 
A n d ķat may be whan here iuges and officers beren hemself so warlich and preueyliche in ponyschyng 
and in doynge rigt ķat mysdoers 
mowe not scape 
but ķei ben iponysched. 
Perfore it is iseid, 
i i Rethoricorum, 
ķat ķei ķat ben preuey ben more idra[d] ķan ķei ķat [ben] not preuey. 
For it is iknowe how kynges and princes scholde bere hemself 
for to be loued 
and how for to be drad, 
it may be sone iknowe ķat Þey eygÞer be nedful, 
gut kynges and princes scholde more desire to be | col. iloued ķan idrad. 
And it is iseid 
tofore ķat ķe principal entent of a kyng v o and of eche prince scholde be for to brynge oķere men in vertue. 
A n d eche good doynge by ķe whiche citeseyns 
ben ķe more good and vertuous scholde be ķe more desired of ķe maÞere of lawe. 
Panne if for citeseyns and men ķat ben in ķe regne don wel and Þepe ķe lawes and heestes of ķe kyng 
for loue of honeste 
and of ķe comyn profit and of ķe kyng, 
ben more goode and vertuous ķanne 
he dede soo for drede of peyne, 
kynges and princes scholde more desire for to be loued of ķe puple ķan idrad; 
for it is more nedful to ķe puple to do wel and leue euel for loue ķan for drede of peyne. 
A n d eyÞer is nedful - 
to be drad and iloued - 
for not alle ben so good and parfit ķat Þey wollen leue euel doynge onliche for loue of honest 
and of ķe comyn profit 
and of ķe maÞere of lawe ķat desireķ ķe comyn profite. 
Panne som men mote be brougte 
to goode and wikdrawe 
fro euel by drede of peyne. 
Naķalees bettere it 
is to be loued ķan idrad, 
as it is declared tofore. II Part III

For ķis twey parties of ķis ķridde book ben isped

what olde philosofres wolde mené 
in rewelyng of citee and of regne 
and also it is declared how cite and regne scholde be rewled

now it is to tretyng of dedes of bataille 
ķat kynges and princes mowe wete and knowe 
in what manere wise bataylles scholde be igeue. 
A n d Vigesius, 
in libro De Re Mylitari, seith ķat comynliche wit col. Book III PartIII 
and sleithe in bataille

ķan doķ multi­ tude oķer strengķe of figtynge men. | % f. i 
A n d dedes of bataille 
ben conteyned vnder chiualrie 
as it schal be declared heere after. 
Wherfore gif we wolle trete of dedes of bataille, 
it is to wetynge what is chiualrie 
and whereto it is iordeyned. 
Panne it is to wetynge 
what is ķe craft of cheualrie; 
it is a manere of prudencia, wisedom, 
oÞer a maner kynde partie of wisdom. 
And as it longeķ to ķis doyng we may distingue fyue manere of wisdomes: 
synguler wisedom, 
wisdome of housbondrie, 
wisdom of regne, 
wisdome of polecie and of rewelyng 
ķat is wisdom of cyuel, 
and wisdom of chiualrie. 
A n d it is iseid 
ķat man haķ singuler wisdom 
whanne he can rewle hymself; 
and ķat is lasse wisdome ķan wisdom of housbandrie 
oķer of regnynge, 
for it is lasse to a kyng 
to kunne rewle hymself 
ķanne it is to kunne rewle manye, 
oķer regne oķer cite. 
Pe seconde manere of wisdom 
is wisdom of housbondrie. 
For as it is iseid, 
v i Ethicorum, 
ķe wise man is icleped prudens 
for he can geue good counsaile 
and rewle to good ende. 
Panne where is diuers manere good, 
ķere is diuers manere of wisdome. 
Panne for good of hous and comyne good of ķe hoole manye 
is oķer ķan eny singuler good, 
wisdoom of housbondrie 
by ķe whiche a man can rewle hous 
and manye mot be oķer ķan wisdom 
by ķe whiche a man can rewle hymself. 
Pe ķridde manere of wisdom 
[is] of regnyng oķer of settyng of lawes. 
For as oo singuler persone 
is a partie of an hous, 
so an hous is a partie of a citee and of a regne. 
| And as good of an hous 
is oķer ķan ķe good coi. 
of a singuler persone, 
so ķe good of an hool citee and of a regne 
is oķer ķan ķe good of an hous. 
Panne wisdome of regnynge 
and of settynge of lawes ķat nedeķ 
in a kyng 
and in eche prince 
ķat scholde geue lawe and rewle regne and citee is oķer ķanne wisdom of hous­ bondrie 
ķat nedeķ 
in an housebonde 
ķat schal rewle hous and mayne. 
A n d in so moche as ķe good of citee and of ķe regne passeķ 
ķe good of hous and Þe good of a singuler persone, 
by so moche ķe wisdom 
ķat nedeķ 
in a kyng scholde passe ķe wisdom of an housebonde 
and ķe wisdome of a singuler persone. 
Wherfore it is wel iseid 
ķat Vigesius seith, 
in libro De Re Militari, 
ķat no man schulde kunne more, 
noķer beter, 
noķer mo thinges ķan a prince, 
for his lore may be profit 
to alle ķe sogettes. 
A n d ķerfore in techinge of kynges and of princes 
we deuyden and delen ķis hoole n ķre booÞes. 
For in ķe firste book we taugte ķat kynges and princes scholde be wise and redy 
as a kyng and a prince 
is a certeyne persone in hymself 
and as ķei scholde rewle hymself. 
A n d in ķe seconde book 
we taugte a kyng 
to be wise and redy 
and in ķat he is housebonde 
and scholde spende ķe good and cataille of his hous. 
A n d in ķe ķridde book 
a kyng is itaugt oķer a prince 
in ķat he is heed of regne oķer of a principate 
and in ķat ķei scholde geue lawes and rewle v citeseynes. 
And alle ķes ķre wisdomes 
a kyng scholde haue: particuler wisdom, 
wisdom of housbandrie, 
and wisdom of regnyng. 
Pe ferķe manere wisdome 
is icleped poletica and | ciuylis. 
For as in a f. i prince 
nedeķ excellent wisdom 
by ķe whiche he may cunne rewle oķere, 
so in eche citeseyn nedeķ 
som manere wisdome 
by ķe whiche he may könne to holde ķe lawes 
and heestes of ķe prince. 
And a cite­ seyn serueķ not so 
a kyng oķer a prince 
as ķe hamer serueķ a smyth, 
for in ķe hamer 
is no knowynge but is onliche imeued of ķe smyk. 
But in a citee nedeķ som wisdom 
by ķe whiche he may haue good opynyoun of kynges ķat ķe kyng hooteķ. 
And ķis wisdom 
is oķer ķan ķe partic­ uler wisdom 
ķat we clepen ķe firste manere wisdom, 
for it is oķer ķat a man kunne rewle hemself in ķat he is som what in hymself. 
Panne it is to conne rewle hymsilf 
in ķat he is sogette to a prince. 
For ķei a man lede a solitarie lif, 
ut hym nedeķ to haue som wisdom 
by ķe whiche he may könne rewle hymself. out he haķ no ciuel wisdom 
noķer wisdom of housbondrie noķer of regnyng 
for he is no citee noķer partee of a citee. 
Pe fifte manere wisdom 
is icleped wisdom of chiualrie. 
For rigtful rewlyng of regne and of citee 
is likned to kynges 
ķat we seen in oon and ķe same man. 
Panne as eche man haķ twey vertues of ķe soule, 
oon by ķe whiche he comeķ to good and voydek harme and anoķer in ķe whiche a reseķ and wikstondek lettes, 
so eche citee and regne nedeķ 
twey vertues and twey manere of wisdomes - wisdomes of makynge of lawe and of cheualrie, 
so ķat by wisdome of makynge of lawe ķe hoole cyte and ķe hoole regne 
may haue good and profit and voide greues, 
and I ķat it may 
by wisdom of chiualrie 
and by dedes of armes rese and col. ouercome kynges ķat leiten. 
Panne ķe craft of cheualrie 
is a manere of wisdom 
by ķe whiche enemyes ben ouercome 
and ķei ķat letten cyuel good and comyn profit. 
Herby it is iknowe 
wherfore chiualrie is iordeyned. 
For as it is declared 
tofor as lawes ben principalich iordeined for ķe comyn profit, 
so cheualrie is principalich iordeined 
for to defende ķe comyn prophite of cite and of regne. 
Pan for ķe comyne profit is ilette 
by resyng of enemyes, 
and by ķe consequent folwynge 
by strif arisyng of citeseyns, 
and by ouersettynge of feble persones, 
we may saye ķat 
as it longeķ principaliche to hym ķat is fortys 
to haue hym wel 
in dedes of armes 
and by ķe consequent folwyng it longeķ to hym to haue hymself wel 
in oķer dredful thinges, 
so it longeķ principaliche to knygtes to haue hem wel 
in dedes of armes 
and by dedes of armes to putte of lettes of enemyes. 
A n d by ķe consequent folwyng it longeķ to hem 
by heste of kyng and of prince 
to lette alle stryf and risyng of citeseyns 
and al ouersettynge of hem ķat ben in Þe regne 
by ķe whiche ouersettynge pees of citeseyns 
and ķe comyn profit myte be disturbled. 
r Book III PartIII 
A n d ķis wisdom of chiualrie 
a kyng scholde principaliche haue. 
For ķei figtynge in bataile and puttyng of of lettes of ķe comyn profit longeķ to knygtes 
and to hem to ķe whiche kyng oķer prince w o l graunte commyssioun, 
nathales how batailles scholde be geue 
and how warliche lettes of 
ķe comyn profit 
may be put of, 
ķe knowynge ķerof | longeķ f. principaliche to ķe prynce. 
A n d herby it may be yknowe 
what men scholde be taÞe to chiualrie. 
For chiualrie semeķ a manere wisdom 
of dedes of batailles 
yordeyned for ķe comyn profit. 
For it semeķ ķat in dedes of batailles 
knygtes ben ilikned to maistres and doctours 
in oķere science; 
wherfore as no man scholde be maad maister in oķer science 
but it be knowe ķat he is wise and cunnynge in ķat art, 
so no man scholde be taÞe 
to ķe dignitee of knygt 
but it be knowe ķat he loue ķe comyn profit of ķe regne, 
but ķer be hope ķat he is good in dedes of batailles, 
and ķat he w o l 
at heeste of ķe prince 
lette strif 
and risynge of citeseyns, 
and figte for rigtwisnesse, 
and lette wik al his mygt al kyng 
ķat may lette Þe comyn profit. 
Herby it may be knowe Þat alle dedes of batailles 
.beķ conteyned vnder Þe art of cheualrie; 
for ķei hors men figte and fot men ķat ben no knygtes, 
gut knygtes scholde be maistres in batailles 
and ordeyne oķere men in bataille. 
Perfore it is iseid 
ķat alle dedes of batailles 
ben conteyned vnder knygthood. 
And so herby it is iknowe 
Þat for knygtes scholde be maisters of batailles, 
ķei figtynge in bataille longe to ķe vertue 
Þat hatte fortitudo, 
as it were stalworthnesse, 
gut cheualrie is conteyned vnder 
wisdom,Þat hatte prudencia. 
v Chapter II 
As it longeķ to ķis doynge tweyne semen nedful to dedes of batailles: 
strengķe for to figte, 
and wisdom to rewle in batailles. 
Wherfore gif we wolle knowe in what contreyesben bestfigtyng men, 
it nedeķ to knowe ķe forseyde tweyne. 
A n d in con|treys ķat ben to nyg ķe sonne 
scholde not figtynge men col. be chose, 
for in hem faillen mygt and boldenesse in bataille, 
as ķe phi­ losofer seith, 
vii Poleticorum. 
And Vigesius, primo libro De Re Militari, 
telleķ ķe cause and seith 
Þat naciouns ķat ben nyg ķe sonne 
ben dryed wik greet heet of ķe sonne, 
and ben sleig, 
but ķei hauen but litel [bl]ood and hauen ķerfore 
noķer stedefastnesse 
noķer trist in figtynge 
for kyndelich ķei dreden wondes. 
A n d for kyndeliche ķei hauen litel [bl]ood, 
kyndelich ķei dreden lost of [bl]ood. 
Perfore ķei ben not prest and redy to bataille 
noķer to stroÞes. 
Also in contrées ķat beķ to fer norķ 
and to fer fro ķe sonne 
scholde not figtynge men be chose. 
For Þei Þei haue moche blood 
so ķat Þei dreden not woundes, 
gut for moche blood ķei ben to hasty and fool hardy, 
as it were wood and vnwise, 
and ben ķerfore not al profitable 
to dedes of batailles. 
For in figtynge, counsaile and wisdom 
is ful profitable. 
For we knowen by experience and ķe philosofer seiķ pleynliche, 
vii Poleticorum, 
Þat men ķat ben to ny ķe sonne ben sclye 
and lacÞen boldenesse, 
and ķei ķat ben fer 
fro ķe sonne passen in boldenesse 
and lakÞen wisdom. 
Panne if boķe wisdome and boldenesse 
ben nedful in batailles, 
of noķere contrée scholde fißtynge men be chose, 
but of mené contreye 
Þat is not to fer fro ķe sonne 
noķer to nyg ķerto so 
Þat ķei ben boķe wyse and bolde. 
But it is to wetynge ķat suche lore 
īo schulde be taÞe 
as it fareķ comynliche, 
for in eche contrée ben som men wise and bolde. 
Nathalees comynliche Þeyg ķat ben nyg ķe sonne lacÞeķ boldenesse and ÞeiÞat ben fer ķerfro lacÞeķ wisdom, 
ļ f. Also it is to wetyng ķat ķei boķe booldenesse and wisdome ben nedful in bataille, 
ut boldenesse is ķe more profitable. 
Perfore gif men ķat bien ny ķe sonne 
and men ķat ben fer ķerfro ben not profitable 
to dedes of bataille, 
but men of mené contrées scholde be chose, 
nathales among men of mené contrées 
men ķat ben fer fro ķe sonne scholde be rather ichose to bataille 
ķanne men ķat ben nyg to ķe sonne for to haue ķe more boldenesse. 
For it is iknowe 
in what contreys ben best fityng men, 
kynges ķat nedeķ in fityng men 
schal be reÞened ķat we may knowe what manere men 
scholde be chose to bataille and of what craftes. 
Panne it is to wetynge ķat for fittyng men 
scholde haue limes able and ivsed to smytyng and scholde not drede schedyng of blood, 
but ķei scholde be bolde and hardy for to rese and fite and myßty and strong for to suffri traueille, 
we may seye Þat smeķes and carpunters 
ben good to deedes of bataille, 
for by craft here armes ben able and ivsed to smytynge. 
Also bouchers ben able ķerto, 
for Þei dreden 
not schedyng of blood 
for ķei ben ivsed 
to slaut of beestes 
and to schedyng of blood. 
Also hunters of boores 
scholde be taÞe to suche dedes, 
for wikoute greet hardinesse 
no man reseķ 
and assailleķ boores. 
Panne suche men ben strong and orpede to fite. 
And on cas it is no lasse perel 
to fite with a boor 
ķanne wik an enemy; 
ķerfore if oon dredeķ 
not ķe perels of a boor, 
it is a toÞene ķat ķei dreden not batailles of enemyes. 
Also hunters of hertes scholde not be a|counted 
in dedes of batailles, 
for col. suche hunters 
vsen to greet trauaille. 
For thinges ķat we hauen iseid, 
of ķes craftes fitynge men scholde be chose. 
if me taÞen heede 
of here owne craft, 
barbours and sowters and taillours 
and oķere sewers 
ben vnprofitable to fite. 
For Þey scholde neuere wel braundische 
and schaÞe a maas noķer a swerd 
ķat scholde haue a lit hond 
and is not ivsed to handely 
but a rasour oķer a nedle; 
for what is ķe proporcioun of an nedele to a spere oķer of a rasour to a maas? 
Also apotecaries, spicers, fyschers and foulers 
scholde not be chose 
to suche dedes, 
for here craft accordeķ 
not to dedes of armes. 
r Book III PartIII 
But it may happe ķat in eche craft 
ben sum wel figtynge men, bolde and hardy, 
and somme fereful and cowardes. 
But as it longeķ 
to manere of craft 
and as a craft maÞeķ 
a man able oķer vnable 
to dedes of armes, 
we seide ķat som craftes 
ben profitable 
to dedes of armes 
and somme vnprofitable. Chapter III

scholde vse traueile of chiualrie and of armes. 
And ķis accordeķ wik Vigesius, De Re Militari, 
and seith fro ķe tyme of springynge of heer 
in ķe Schaar children 
scholde vse traueylle of cheualrie. 
And for we louen wel doynge 
ķat we bygynnen in uķe, 
gif ķe maÞere of lawe 
w o l maÞe citeseyns figtynge men 
and able to figte, 
ķei scholde raķer bygynne tofore tyme ķanne late tyme passe and bygynne to late. 
For as Vigesius seith, 
bettere it is ķat a ļ child be vsed f. i tofore age of figtynge ķan ķat he be sory 
that tyme and age is passed. 
Also it is a special resoun 
w h i it nedeķ ķat children 
in gowÞe vse craft of bataile, 
for it is not litel noķer ligt craft 
to haue wisdome 
to dedes of armes. 
For gif an hors man oķer a foot man mot figte, 
it semeķ as it were happe 
to haue ķe victorie gif he haķ not ķe craft of figtynge; 
for boķe in figtynge 
on hors and afote nedeķ manye cautels. 
For it is folie to lerne not toforehoond 
but lerne figte whanne he mot nedes figte whanne his lif 
is in peril of deeķ. 
Panne for figtynge men 
scholde haue tyme to lerne al ķat nedeķ to bataille, 
ķei scholde be vsed to dedes of bataille 
fro tyme of springyng heere in ķe Schaar. 
Wherfore gif ķe maÞers of lawe, 
kyng oķer prince schal do a bataille, 
he schal taÞe with hym figtynge men 
ķat ben ivsed 
and ben stronge and orpede. 
For it is iknowe 
in what age figtynge men 
scholde be taÞe to dedes of armes, 
it is to tretynge 
by what signes scholde be knowe able men to figte. 
Panne it is to wytynge ķat bolde men 
and hardye ben bettre to bataille ķan ferful men. 
Also stronge men and men 
w i k harde body, 
for ķei ben more mygty, 
scholde be chose to bataille. 
Also for we seen 
Þat som bestes ben bolde to figte 
and sum ben ferful, 
men Þat ben most ileche to beestes 
Þat ben bolde to figte ben beste to bataille. 
By ķre manere signes we knowen bolde men to figte. First, 
by signes of boldenesse and hardenesse. 
Pe seconde, 
by signes of | mygt and strengķe of col. body. 
Pe ķridde, 
by signes of liknesse to beestes 
ķat ben bolde to figte. 
Pe signes of boldenes 
and of strengķe of |bodyt : ligt eige, 
arerynge of ķe polie. 
Perfore Vigesius seith 
ķat a gongelyng 
ķat scholde be taÞe to dedes of armes 
scholde haue a ligt eyge 
and bere vp ķe heed. 
A n d signes of strengķe of body 
and of lymes ben hard flesch, 
sadde senewes and brawn. 
For as ķe philosofer seith, 
viii Poleticorum, 
ķat dede of armes and scharpnes of wit nedeķ contrarie manere. 
For as it is iwrete, 
i i De v Anima, men wik nesche flesche ben witty; 
but ķe contrarie men with hard flesch 
and sad senewes and brawon ben mygty and strong of body 
and most able to figte. 
A n d signes of liknes to beestes 
Þat ben bolde to figte 
ben greete otmeste lemes and brood breeste. 
For we seen ķat lyons 
Þat ben strengeste of bestes 
hauen greet armes and brood brestes. 
Panne whanne we seen ķat a man haķ ligt eyge and bereķ 
vp ķe heed and haķ hard flesch 
with sad senewes and brawon 
with grete armes and brood breeste, 
we schal argue ķat he is a worryour 
and able to figte. 
Panne suche men scholde be worriours, 
for comynliche ķei ben able to dedes of bataille. Chapter IV 
As it longeķ to ķis doynge, 
we may reÞene eigte ķat werryours scholde haue, 
by ķe whiche 
as it longeķ to ķis doynge 
we may declare what manere werriours 
a kyng oķer a prince scholde chese. 
For first, 
figtynge men mote haue 
mygt to bere and susteyne heuy burķones. 
Pe seconde, 
mygt as it were alwey | 
to suffre meuynge of membres 
and f. greet traueille. 
Pe ķridde, 
mygt to suffre scarsete of mete and of drynÞe. 
Pe ferķe, ķei scholde not recche of ese of liggyng and of stondynge. 
Pe fifķe, 
ķe[i] scholde telle more prise of rigtwisnesse 
and of ķe comyn profit ķan of bodilich lif. 
Pe sixte, 
not be agrised of schedyng of blood. 
Pe seuenthe, 
be sleyg and connynge 
to defende hemself 
and to smyte oķere. 
Pe eigteķe, 
to be aschamed to flee cowardliche. First, 
it is nedful to figtynge men in bataille 
to haue mygt 
to bere gret wigt, 
for naÞede men fallen 
where euere ķei [ben] smyte. 
Wherfore but a man mowe bere ķe wigt of ärmere, he is vnprofitable to bataille. Pe seconde, 
it is spedful to worriours 
to suffre 
as it were contynuel traueille and meuynge of lymes. 
For gif ķei meue not alwey in bataille, 
his aduersaries ben not bygyled in smytynge for alwey 
he is isette to fonge stroÞes. 
For it is experience and assay 
ķat a man ķat moueķ alwey 
may vnneķe oķer neuere be smyte 
with fui strooÞe 
but alwey he voideķ woundes and stroÞes. 
For as gif a signe meuede and abood not stille 
he 
ne scholde not be sone ismete of an archere, 
so a man ķat meueķ alwey is not so sone iwonded of his enemye 
as a scholde gif he stood stille and meuede not. 
Panne continual meuyng of lymes 
is nedful 
for to voide wondes and stroÞes 
and also for to geue wondes and stroÞes, 
and ķerfore figtyng men most haue mygt 
to dure long 
in continual meuyng of lymes. 
Pe ķridde, figtynge men scholde not recche of scarsete of mete | 
and col. of drynÞe. 
For passynge mygt of armure, 
and to charge of oķere thinges 
ķat nedeķ 
to defence of an ooste, 
defaute of mete 
and of drynÞe is most greuous; 
and gut it is spedful to figtynge men 
som tyme to spare r Book III PartIII mete and diynÞe. 
For ķeig figtynge men 
haue mete and drynÞe ynowg withoute greef, 
ut abstinence is nedful for hem so 
ķat he taÞe not to moche mete and drynÞe for ķanne 
Þei mowe ķe bettere dure traueile of figtynge. 
Pe ferķe, 
Þei scholde not recche of dissease of liggyng and of stondyng. 
For som tyme it is spedful to figtyng men 
to be armed day and nygt, 
ķerfore Þei ben in noon ese noķer restyng liggyng noķer stondyng. 
Pe fifte, 
ķei scholde telle more pris of rigtwisnesse and of comyne profit 
ķanne of bodilich lif. 
Panne for aile ķe dedes of bataille 
ben in peril of deķ, 
neuere man is fortys and bold werryour 
but he be in som wise dredles of peril of deķ. 
And as ķe philosofer meneķ, iii Ethicorum, 
it longeķ to hym ķat is fortis 
and a good werryour 
to drede not to die wel in bataille. 
A n d it is iseid ķat a man deyek wel in bataille 
whanne ķei figten rigtfullich, 
and for ķe contre [he setteķ] hymsilf rigtfulliche and bodiliche 
to perel of deeķ 
for som greet profit of ķe comynte. 
A n d gif a man loueķ bodilich lyf more ķan ķei scholde, 
he w o l ligtliche chese a foul fligt. 
Pe sixte, 
figtynge men scholde not be agrise of schedynge of blood. 
For gif a man haķ a nesche herte 
and is wommanliche 
and agrised of schedyng of blood, 
he dar not wounde his enemyes. 
A n d by ķe conse­ quent folwynge 
he dar not wel figte in | % bataille. 
Pe seuenķe, 
ķei scholde be cunnynge 
to defende hemself 
and to smyte oķere. 
For as it is iseide, primo Ethicorum, 
ķe ende of cheualrie is victorie. 
But for alle vertues and dedes of bataille 
ben conteyned vnder chiualrie 
as it is declared tofore, 
and as ķe philosofer seith 
it is iseide ķat [of] alle dedes of bataille 
victorie is ķe ende, 
wherfore by cause ķat principalliche figtynge men 
hauen ķe victorie 
gif ķei kunne wel defende hemself 
and smyte oķere, 
connynge of defence and smytynge 
is spedful to figtynge men in bataille. 
And how suche connynge may be had 
and how enemyes schol be smyte 
and what helpeķ heereto, 
it schal be declared herafter. 
Pe eigtķe, 
werriours scholde be schamed 
to flee cowardliche. For as it is seid, iii Ethicorum, 
most orpede werriours 
ben among men ķat worschepeth orpede werriours. 
A n d among oķere ķat maÞen 
a man able to figte in bataille 
is loue to haue worschep of figtyng 
and be aschamed to fle cowardliche. 
And it is to takyng heede ķat for we seide ķat werriours 
scholde not be agrise of chedynge of blood noķer telle greet prys of bodilich lif 
and oķere suche ķat we reÞened playnliche ķe menyng: 
ķat is [to] vnderstondynge in rigtful bataille. 
For by cause of ķe defence of ķe contreye, 
of rigtwisnesse, 
and of ķe comyn profit, 
schedyng of blood scholde not be spared noķer oķer suche by ķe whiche rigtwisnesse 
and ķe comyn profit may be defended. 
f. i v Herby it is playnliche iknowe what maner werryours 
and what figt­ ynge men 
a kyng oķer a prince scholde chese; 
for ķei scholde be chose among | citeseyns ķat hauen most of thinges 
ķat nedeķ to figtynge. col. Chapter V For thinges { ben ireÞened Þat werriours scholde haue, 
it is to tretynge 
whiche ben best - por<t> men, gentil men and noble men, 
oķer vppelondische men. 
And gif kynges ķat ben iseid ben iknowe, 
it semeķ ķat vppelondische men ben best. 
And it semeķ ķat Vigesius 
is of ķis opynyoun, 
for he seith in ķis wise: 
"I neuere trowe ķat ķer mygte be a doute imeued 
but ķat vppelondische men 
ben most able to dedes of armes." 
And herto helpeķ thinges 
ķat we seide tofore. 
For it is iseide 
ķat figtynge men 
schulde susteyne greete 
and heuye wigtes, 
and continual trauele of lymes, 
scarsete of mete and of drynÞe, 
desese of liggynge and of stondyng, 
noķer drede deķ, 
noķer agrise of schedyng of blood, 
and oķere suche ķat we speÞe of in ķe nexte chapitre. 
A n d soķ it is ķat vppelondische men 
most happen to ķe forseide thinges, 
for vppelondische men ben ivsed to heuy burķons. 
Perfore heuy armure schal not greeue hem 
ķat ben ivsed 
in tyme of pees 
to more heuy burķouns. 
Also rennyng and meuynge of armes 
and of oķere lemes % greueķ hem not, 
for ķei ben continualliche ivsed 
to suche meuynge 
and grettere traueille. 
Also scarsete of mete 
and of drynÞe greueķ hem not, 
for Þei holden hem apaied 
to drynÞe water 
and to eete greet breed. 
Also vppelondische men ben not igreued with desese of leggyng and stondyng, 
for ķei dreden not hete of ķe sonne noķer recchen of schadewe 
noķer knowen solace of baÞes; 
but liggyng on ķe sadde grounde he slepeķ more sweteliche ķan gentil | 
men ķat resten in beddes. 
Also it is semelich 
ķat ķei drede not moche deķ; 
for ķe more delicatliche 
a man lyuek 
and Þe more solace he haķ in his lif, 
ķe more he dredeķ deķ. 
And so it semeķ ķat ķei ben not agrise, 
ķat is agast, 
of schedyng of blood. 
For among men it semeķ ķat vppelondische men 
ben most cruel, 
ķanne to hem ķat taÞeķ heede ķerto it semeķ ķat vppelondesche men 
ben best werryours. 
And oķere ķer ben be ķe whiche it semeķ 
ipreued ķat port men, gentil men, and noble men ben best figters. 
For among oķere ķat maÞen men 
goode figters is desire 
to haue worschip of figtynge 
and be aschamed 
to flee cowardliche. 
And as ķe philosofer seith, 
iii Ethicorum, 
ķat made Ector boold and hardy, 
for Ector seide, 
"if eche flee out of ķe bataille, 
ķanne Polidamas 
w o l reproue me." 
Also in ķis wise Diomedus 
was imaad bold and hardy; 
for he seide, 
"if I turne ķe bac in bataille, 
ķanne Ector 
w o l do despice me 
among ķe Troians 
and w o l saye to me, 
'Diomedes is 
ouercome.'" Wherfore by cause ķat loue of worschep and schame of foule doynge longeķ more to gentil men ķan f. i r Book III PartIII to chéries, 
gentil men semeķ ķe betere figtynge men 
for hem schameķ to flee. 
Also scleythe and wisdom 
helpeķ moche in bataille, 
for som tyme sleyķe and wyles helpen more 
to gete ķe victorie 
ķan doķ strengķe of men. 
Pan for comynliche gentil men 
ben wisere and more sley ķan chéries, 
it folwek ķat ķei ben ķe bettre fitynge men. 
A n d thes tweyne semen 
most helplich to gete ķe victorie: 
schame of fligt | 
and konnyng col. of fitynge. 
Panne for to knowe Þe sooķ of Þe doom ķat is iaxed, 
it nedeķ to knowe ķat for diuerse manere fitynge diuerse fittyng men scholde be chose. 
For fittynge may be an hors oķer an foot; 
and in fitynge afoot cherles ben bettre ķan noble men, 
for vse of beryng of heuy wites helpetķ] 
most to dure in strong traueile. 
A n d in fitynge an hors, gentil men and noble men ben best, 
for strengķe of hors helpeķ 
in defaute ķat gentil men hauen. 
Strengķe of hors helpeķ 
for of hemself 
ķei mowe not wik so greet traueille as cherles mowe. 
But in suche fitynge cunnynge of fitynge helpeķ 
moche wiÞschame of flit. 
Nathalees it is to wetynge ķat for to maÞe gentil men 
and noble orpede fiters 
in eiķer manere fitynge, 
Þey scholde be vsed to <b>ere heuy armure 
and to suffre trauele and meuynge of membris of ķe body, 
of armes and oķere membris 
as it nedeķ for dedes of armes. Chapter VI 
In libro De Re Mylitari, 
Vigesius seith ķat vse of armure and cunnyng of fityng 
maad ķe world sogette to ķe Romayns; 
for what myte fewe Romayns 
do 
aenst manye Spaynels, 
aenste wyles of Assiries, 
and aenst ķe wisdom of ķe Grees 
but ķei hadde be vsed in armes 
and hadde greet cunnynge of fitynge? 
And it is not inconuenyent 
to a man ķat is wis in o doynge 
be [vn]connynge 
in anoķer manere doynge 
for defaute of experience of particular doynge. 
A n d so ofte it falleķ ķat wise men 
in oķere doynges for defaute of vse of ärmere ben not | cunnynge in bataille. 
For in eche manere doynge vse 
is cause of hardynesse so Þat he Þat is ivsed dredeķ 
not to do suche dedes. 
For as Vigesius seyth no man dredeķ to do dedes 
Þat he trowek 
Þat he haķ wel ilerned. 
Perfore it is ķat in eche bataille 
vse of [/ armes] 
is so moche worth 
Þat fewe men ķat ben ivsed ben redy to haue ķe victorie, 
and manye ķat ben vnkunnynge and boystors 
% ben alwey isette to fligt 
and to stroÞes. 
For it is iknowe ķat vse of armes is ful profitable 
to do dedes of bataille, 
it is to declarynge 
how fitynge men 
scholde be ivsed to go by ordre and passe. 
For suche doynges is nedful in bataille 
as it schal be declared, 
and defaute of vse 
of suche doynge 
is ful greuous to fitynge men. 
f. v And first, 
knygtes and foot men 
and alle figtynge men 
scholde be vsed to goo in gree and paas of bataile 
so ķat eche goo 
in his owne gree and ordre. 
For if ķe schiltrom of foot men 
oķer of knytes gon not in ordre, twey harmes comeķ ķerof. 
For if ķei gon not in Þew ordre, 
ķe schiltrom schal be in oon side to kynne, 
as it were desparpuled 
and men to feer atwynne; 
and in ķe oķer side to strayte 
with more preesÞan nedeķ. 
A n d first, 
for Þe oo side is to kynne 
and men ben to feer atwynne, 
enemyes comen Þe sonnere withinne Þe schiltrom; 
and so Þe schiltrome 
isÞe sonnere ouercome. 
Pe seconde, 
in ķe side ķat is to strait wik to greet prees, 
men ben ilett for to smyte. 
For whan a fityng man ‡ 
is in to strait prees of his felowes, 
his | armes ben ilette col. 
ķat he may not smyte ķe enemyes. 
For ķes tweyne ben nedful in a schiltrom - 
ķat enemyes come not sone wikinne 
and ķat he be not ilette to smyte - 
and ķat may not be but Þew gree and ordre be iÞepte in goynge, 
ķanne boķe foot men and hors men 
ķat ar in vse of bataille 
scholde ofte come togeders 
and be vsed and iarmed and goo in ordre 
as Þei Þei scholde fite in bataille. 
And gif ķe mayster of bataille 
seek eny fityng men out of ordre in ķe schiltrom, 
[he] scholde blame hym and amende hym. 
Oķer if ķei trespassen to moche, 
ķei schul putte hym al 
out of ķe schiltrom as oon 
Þat is vnprofitable to fite. 
Pe seconde, boķe foot men and hoors men scholde vse to renne 
for to be sweper 
and swift to renne 
tofore oķere, 
for it semeķ ķat ķat helpeķ to ķre. First, 
to aspie doynge of enemyes, 
for it is good in an oost 
ķat somme swyft men renne tofore ķat mowe not sone be taÞe of enemyes 
aspienge Þe condiciouns and doyng of enemyes. 
Pe seconde, 
ķat is good for to gete Þe beste place; 
for place helpeķ moche in fitynge. 
Perfore if fitynge men ben ivsed to renne among, 
‡ ķei mow Þe beter gete ķ[e] beste place 
ķat helpeķ to fitynge. 
Also Þat is good for to pursewe enemyes ķat fleeķ, 
for a man may not sone scape here 
hondes ķat rennen swiftliche. 
Pe ķridde, fitynge men scholde vse to lepe Þat Þei conne lepe oķer goo lepynge. 
A n d ķat helpeķ to ķre: firste, 
to putte of lettes; 
ķe seconde, 
to fere enemyes; 
ķe ķridde, 
to smyte ķe bettre strooÞes. 
A n d som tyme ben in ķe wey | deches and oķere lettes 
ķat mowe not be f. 
i passed wikoute lepyng. 
Wherfore it is good for to putte of lettes 
ķat hors men 
conne so ride and priÞe hors 
ķat ķei mowe be lepynge passe deches and oķere lettes. 
Also foot men and knytes 
if ķei ben afoot, 
if ķei wollen be good werriours, 
scholde in uķe vse to lepe 
Þat ķei mow be lepyng 
passe diches and oķere lettes. 
Also Þerby enemyes ben aferd 
whanne ķei seen here enemyes go to lepyng. 
Also lepyng by cause of meuyng maÞen smyte ķe bettre stroÞes. 
r Book III PartIII Chapter VII 
And wikoute ķe forseide ķre ķat we seide ķat werriours scholde vse, 
we may reÞene eite ķat ķei schulde vse. First, ķei schul vse 
to bere hem burķons. 
Pe i i , 
to [riese 
and to smyte with a maas. 
Pe ķridde, 
to krowe dartes 
and to smyte with speres. 
Pe ferķe, 
to schete arwes. 
Pe fifte, 
to krowe stoones wik slynges. 
Pe sexte, 
to smyte with plumbatis. 
Pe seuenthe, 
to smyte hors. 
Pe eite, 
to conne ķe craft of swymmynge. 
Also eueremore it were to tellynge how werriou[r]s scholde vse to smyte wik swerdes, 
but herof we schal maÞe a special chapitre. 
A n d first, 
werriours scholde vse to bere burķons 
so ķat ķei scholde vse more heuye wites ķan ķe wit of ķe ärmere 
i n ķe whiche ķei scholde be armed. 
For vsage is as it were a certeyne kynde. 
Panne whanne a man 
is ivsed to beere a greet wit, 
it semeķ hym ķat he is as it were lit 
whanne he goķ icharged wik lasse WÍL 
Also not onliche armure 
but also oķere | thinges mote be boore in bataille. 
Also ķerfore col. it is good vse to bere more wit ķan ķe ärmere weye. 
Pe seconde, worriours scholde vse to rese 
and to smyte with a maas. 
For Vigesius seith ķat in olde tyme among ķe Romayns 
i n a certeyn feeld 
were manye poles ipigt, 
and children ķat scholde be good men of armes scholde vse to rese to ķulÞe poles 
so ķat eche childes schilde schulde be suche to so heuy as Þe schild ķat is ibore in bataile 
and also a maas of tree of double wyt; 
and eche of thilÞe children 
so icharged scholde goo aenste oon of ķulÞe poles 
as it were to aenste a enemye and smyte ķat pole now aboue and now byneÞe 
and now in ķe myddel, 
and by hymself aenste ķat pole 
with hasty reses smytynge and defendynge hymself and doyng 
as it nedeķ i n bataile aenst enemyes. 
A n d whanne ķe children 
were longe ivsed for to do so eerliche and late and afterward, 
whan Þey come to bataille ķei were not igreued 
wik smytyng 
with maas noķer in durynge 
alle manere trauele of bataille. 
Pe ķridde, 
also werriou[r]s scholde vse to krowe dartes 
and gauelocÞes 
and to smyte with speres ķe poles ķat ben ipigt. 
A n d som tyme it was so ķat whanne children were ivsed to smyte suche pooles ipigt wik a maas ķanne he scholde vse to smyte wik darte and w i k Speere. 
For ķei stood after and vsede here armes to krowe ķat Þey myte smyte ķe pole 
oķer krowe ny ķerto. 
A n d it is to wetynge 
ķat in krowynge a dart oķer a speere first 
it mot be stron[g]liche | ischaÞe and ķerafter f. i mytiliche ithrowe. 
For whanne ķe dard 
is strongliche ischaÞe, 
for ķe grete meuynge ķat it maÞeķ i n ķe eyere, 
it passeķ ķe forķere 
and eueķ ķe gretter strook. 
Pe ferķe, worryours scholde vse to schete arwes and quarels with bowes 
oķer with arblasters. 
For it happeķ som tyme ķat we may not come 
to ķe enemyes to fite 
w i k hem at honde. 
A n d ķou ķei ķat assayllen enemyes 
mow come to hem honde at honde, 
it ar Þey come v togeders, 
it is good to fere hem wik bowes 
and with arblasters. 
And it is iwrete of oon Affric[an]o Scipio 
ķat whanne he scholde figte for Þe Romayns, 
he trowede not to haue ķe victorie 
but he medled in al ķe schiltroms chosene archers. 
Pe fifķe, 
worriours scholde vse to krowe stones wik schlynges. 
A n d ķis manere of fityng 
was ifounde in certeyne ilondes of ķe see 
in ķe whiche eylondes, 
as Vigesius seith, 
children were so scley 
ķat here moders 
wolde eue hem no mete 
but suche as ķei smete 
w i k here slynges. 
And ķis vsage is good for it 
is no traueyle 
to bere a slynge. 
But som tyme it happeķ ķat fitynge 
is in stony place 
and ķat som huile mot be defended. 
Also in asaylynge of castels and citées 
it is good to krowe stones with slenges. 
Pe sexte, werriours scholde vse to smyte wik plumbattes. 
For a bal of leed oķer of ire ichayned 
to a stale oķer 
a staffe of tree eueķ 
a soore strooÞe. 
For by cause of strong meuyng of ķe eiere, 
such a bal ichayn­ ed 
to a staffe eueķ 
a more soor strook 
ķan it scholde

And | worriours scholde vse al manere smytynges for col. 
to fite and smyte diuerseliche aenste diuerse enemyes. 
Pe seuenķe, werriours scholde vse to lepe to horse. 
For as Vigesius seith 
in olde tyme ķer were hors imaad of tree 
on ķe whiche children scholde vse to lepe in wynter in house 
and in somer in felde. 
First ķei scholde lepe on suche horse 
vnarmed and afterward iarmed; 
and vsede so to lepe in eyÞere side 
in boķe rigt side 
and lift side and al aboute, 
and vsede so to lepe ķat ķei wolde lepe to ķulÞe horse

and vsede so to lepe in pees ķat ķei wolde in werre lepe to hors anoon withoute abydyng. 
Pe eite, worriours scholde vse ķe crafte of swymmyng 
and cunne swymme. 
For brygges beķ not alwey redy 
and depnesse of water is vnknowe. 
Wherfore for vnkonnyng of swymmynge 
many men ben ilost. 
Perfore among ķe Romaynes 
was an vsage ķat children

after ķat ķei hadde 
ivsed dedes of armes 
a greet deel of ķe day, 
if it were couenable tyme for to swymme, 
Þey scholde be ilad to ķe fleem ķat hatte Tyber

A n d not oonliche foot men

But it is to wetynge of ķat forseyde vse of doynge

A n d how it stondeķ ķerof it nedeķ

r Book III PartIII Chapter VIII 
Amonge oķere, 
dedes of bataile semeķ most perelous. Perfore ķerinne nedeķ greet besynesse, 
for in suche dedes may no man be [to] 
waar noķer 'haue 
'to manye cautels. 
For in figtynge it is bettere to haue more besynesse 
ķan suche batailles axe ķanne it is to be 
necgligent in eny wise. 
For Vigesius seith ķat Catoun seide ķat in oķere dedes errour may be amended. 
But errour of bataille may not be amended, 
but ķe peyne folwek ķe errour anon. 
For ķei ķat figten vnwisliche and vnredyliche ben ilost anoon 
oķer ķei turnen and ben imaad so ferful ķat vnneķe oķer neuere ķei dar figte agenste ķe victories. Wherfore it is not to passynge ķat it is good in bataille 
to haue manye cautels; 
al ķat is good and profitable to ķe oost 
it were good iknowe lest he be ouercome of enemyes. 
Hit happeķ ofte tyme by daye 
and by nygte ķat ķe oost 
is wikoute diches 
and is not waar ķat enemyes ben nyg, 
and enemyes comen vppon ķe oost 
vnwar and ouercome ķe oost. 
Perfore after ķat ķe oost haķ ydo his iourneye 
and w o l som whare abyde al nygt oķer lengere tyme, 
gif enemyes mow 
by happe come to ķat place, anoun scholde diches be maad aboute ķe % oost 
and som strengķe arered 
as it were castels. 
For no kyng is so good noķer so nedful in bataile 
as it is ķat strengķes 
be wel imaad and castels be set arigt, 
so ķat withinne ķe space of ķe castels 
al ķe oost may abyde siÞerliche and saafliche in | col. 
what side it euere be ķat enemyes comen and bysegen hem. 
A n d an oost schal haue alwey wik hym good strengķes 
so ķat it may seme 
whanne ķei pecchen here 
[i]n Jtentes ķat ķei leden aboute wik hem 
as it were strong walled citee. 
For it is iknowe ķat it is good to maÞe diches and castels 
aboute an oost, 
it is to declarynge 
in what wise suche strengķe and castels scholde be maad. 
For gif ķe enemyes ben absent, 
it is not greet maystrie 
to diÞe 
and maÞe diches 
and arere strengķe and castels 
aboute ķe oost. 
But gif ķe enemyes ben present, 
ķanne it is hard to maÞe strengķe and castels. 
And in suche a caas tweyne ben nedful - 
oon 
is wikstondynge of enemyes, 
and ķe oķer makyng of castels. A n d in suche caas be menynge of wis men, 
ķe oost schold be departed so 
ķat al hors men [and] oon partie of ķe foot men 
scholde be ordeyned 
in ķe schiltrom 
to putte of ķe rees of enemyes; 
and ķe oķer partie of foot men 
ķat may swyfliche and sone maÞe castels 
scholde werche swyftliche and maÞe castels. 
And in makynge of castels 
and diches mote be certeyne maysters 
ouere oķere to maÞe 
ķe slowe spede 
and to telle eche how 
and what he scholde doo. 
For it is declared ķat it is good to maÞe castels and h o w castels scholde be maad in presence of enemyes, 
it is to declarynge 
what moot be knowe 
in makynge of castels. 
A n d in makyng of dyches and of castels wikinne ķe whiche ķe oost schal abyde ķre mot be knowe place, schappe, 
and ķe manere of ķe strengķe. 
And as it longeķ to ķis doynge, 
touchynge ķe place foure mot be knowe. First, | ķat ķer be water inow 
and oķere thinges 
ķat nedeķ to ķe f. oost. 
Pe seconde, 
ķer scholde no hille be ķer nyg noķer oķer place out of ķe whiche ķe oost mygt be assailled. 
Pe ķridde, touchinge ķe place it is to takynge heede of ķe space 
aboute ķe whiche ķe strengķe schal be arered 
so ķat no more space be taÞe ķan nedeķ for so manye men. 
Also ķat not so litel be taÞe ķat it be to strait 
and to litel for ķe oost. 
Pe ferķe, gif it nedeķ 
ķat ķe oost abide ķer longe tyme, 
if it may be, 
a place scholde be chose 
Þat stondeķ in good ayre. 
For in an oost nedeķ not onliche be waar of wondes, 
but also gif it may be it nedeķ to be waar of pestilence, eueles. 
For it is iknowe wherof me scholde taÞe hede touchinge places of castels, 
it is to declarynge 
of what schap ķei scholde be. 
And it semeķ ķat Vigesius wolde mené ķat strengķes and diches aboute an oost scholde haue foure sides 
and be euene long. 
Nathales for round schap 
of a cercle fongeķ most, 
betere it is to maÞe strengķe of round schap 
oķer of schappe with manye corners. 
For ķer is greet drede of rees of enemyes 
it nedeķ to maÞe diches for ķe corners, 
for ķat schap is most able to defence 
a[s] it schal be seid herafter. 
And suche a schap is best in makyng of castels 
[but] ķer ben som ilette in ķe place. 
For it happeķ som tyme in a place 
ķat suche schap may not be ķerinne. 
And in suche a caas castels 
scholde be maad of Þe schap 
of half a cercle 
oķer ķre cornerde oķer square oķer of som oķer schap 
as ķe place axek. 
And ķe principal 
[]at scholde be mad 
tow|ard ķe enemyes and Þederward as col. ķe oost passeķ. 
Also in castels scholde be sette vp baners and penouns and pencels 
ķat gif it happeķ ķat eny of Þe oost be fer fro ķe castels 
Þey mow be sigt of baners 
and penouns come hoom ageyn. 
For ķese kynges ben itreted, 
ķe manere of makynge of strengķe 
and of castels is to knowynge. 
For gif ķe oost 
w o l abyde ķere longe tyme, 
ķe more strong strengķe scholde be maad 
and ķe more large diches. 
But gif ķei w o l abide ķere but oon nygt oķer elles 
but a litel tyme, 
ķanne it nedeķ not to maÞe so greet strengķe. 
A n d Vigesius techeķ ķe manere of quantité of diches; 
and seith gif ķer is drede of greet strengķe of enemyes, 
ķe diche schold be nyne foot brood 
and seuene foot depe. 
And gif ķer is grettere strengķe of enemyes, 
ķe diche schold be ķe more brood 
and ķe more deep so 
ķat he be twelf foot brood. 
But as it is to wetynge 
ķat gif ķe diche is nyne foot brood, 
ķe erķe ķat is ikrowe vp 
on ķe diches brynÞe riseķ foure foot heye so 
ķat ķe diche is 
as it were elleuene foot deep. 
And ķe diche schal be outward toward ķe enemyes and ķe erķe schal be krowe inward toward ķe oost. 
And in ķat erķe scholde be ipigt staÞes and poles and oķere treen and oķere v Book III PartIII 
strengte ķat scholde be lad aboute wiķ ķe oost. 
And whan castels and diches ben so imaad, 
ķe oost may abyde ķe more siÞerliche. Chapter IX 
As it is declared, 
in dedes of bataille 
is most nede to be waar. 
For in happes of batail 
is no remedie, 
it is besiliche to takyng heede of alle thinges 
ķat scholde be knowe in bataille 
and ķat | tofore ķat ķe batailles f. i figte. 
For bettere it is not figte ķan ķat a man putte hymself to fortune 
and to hap withoute good avisement. 
And in bataile we seen tweyne figtynge men 
and help ķat nedeķ to flöte. 
A n d as it longeķ to ķis do­ ynge, 
touchynge figtynge men sex mote be knowe; 
and touchyng ķe helpe, 
oķere sexe 
may be reÞened 
ķat scholde also be ķere iknowe. 
For a kyng oķer a prince oķer a duk of an oost 
ķat scholde be sobre, 
wise and slyg nedeķ to knowe twelue in al, 
sex touchynge ķe men and sexe touchynge oķere helpes 
ar he geue a bataille. 
A n d touchyng ķe men ķat schal figte ben sexe ķat helpeķ to haue ķe victorie. 
Pe firste is ķe nombre and tale of figtynge men. 
For with oķere thinges irewled arigt, 
ķe more nombre of men 
scholde haue ķe victorie. 
For as it is iseid, 
ii Poleticorum, 
quantité in figtynge is profitable 
as ķe more wigt weyget more ķan ķe lasse. 
Pe seconde, touchinge ķe figtynge men here vsage of doynge scholde be knowe. 
For ķei ķat hauen armes not ivsed to smyte and lymes not ivsede to figte [ben] failyng in susteynyng of figtynge, 
for vsage is as it were anoķer kynde, 
so ķat eche man ķat is ivsed doķ his worÞes 
ķe more strongliche 
and ķe more spedfulliche and wik ķe lasse peyne and trauayle. 
Pe ķridde, 
suffrynge of disease of body scholde be knowe, 
for ķei ķat ben in an oost mote suffre manye deseses. 
Wherfore gif ķer ben eny men ķat ben nesche and wommanliche 
ķat may not with desese 
ķat werryours suffren and men ķat ben ouercome for ķulÞe deseses, 
ķei I forsaÞen to figte and fleeķ out of ķe oost. col. Pe ferķe, strengķe scholde be iknowe and hardnesse of body. 
For ķer is greet difference 
betwene hardnesse of yren and neschenesse of selÞene clooķ and likynge of pleye 
and scharpnesse of figtynge. 
For to speÞe of bataylle generalliche al men 
w o l be good werriours; 
but whanne ķei comen to assay of particuler dedes 
and tasteķ ķe hardynesse of yre and mygt of armure 
and how gret ķe trauaille 
is of figtyng 
and h o w sore ķe wondes 
ben ķat enemyes geuen, 
comynlich he is hard of flesch and strong of body 
gif he drawek hym not for suche thinges out of ķe bataile. 
For gif it happe ķat men 
with nesche flesch desiren figtynge and bataile 
after ķei hauen assayed figtynge in batayl, 
ķat is bot seide. 
For as it is iseide tofore, 
men with nesche flesche ben witty and comynliche vnhable to figte, 
for it is hard to suche men

Þe wigt of ärmere 
and here woundes

Pe fifte, 
in worriours wyles scholde be iknowe and scleygÞe for to figte. 
For ķe more waar werryours ben, 
ķe sonnere Þey geten ķe victorie. 
Pe sexte, mygt and boldynesse of herte scholde be knowe; 
for in figtynge comynliche ķei ķat ben most hardy and bold of herte hauen ķe victorie. 
Panne kyng and prince oķer duk of an oost or ķei figte in bataille scholde taÞe hede of sexe touchynge figtynge men.

For in bataille helpen hors, ärmere, vitailles, place of figtynge, tyme, 
and helpe of frendes 
and of soudiours. 
And first, ķe duk of an oost scholde taÞe heede 
in wheÞer side

Pe seconde, 
in wheÞer side 
ben ķe bettre archers 
and mo men of armes 
with bettere ärmere. 
Pe ķridde, 
in wheÞer side 
is most píente of vittailes. 
For som tyme withoute wounde 
and withoute bataille enemyes 
ben dede faylyng vitailes 
and mowe not abyde 
for scarsete of vitailles. 
Pe ferķe, ķe figtynge % place scholde be knowe 
as wheÞer partie 
is in ķe heigere place oķer in ķe bettre place to figte. 
Pe fifte, tyme scholde be knowe wheÞer 
in ķe tyme ķat bataille scholde be ķe sonne be in ķe face of ķe oo partie oķer in ķe face of ķe enemyes, 
and gif ķe wynd blowek and rereķ poudre agenst hem 
oķer agenst ķe enemyes. 
For Þei Þat hauen ķe sonne and wynd and poudre agenst

and mowe not wel figte. 
The sexte, 
it scholde be knowe 
wheÞer partie abydek mo helpers. 
For I gif enemyes abyden more helpe, 
oķer it is not to doynge to figte, 
col. oķer figtynge scholde be higed and ihasted, 
and gif Þey hemself abyden more help, 
ķe figtyng scholde be taryed. 
Panne gif ķes kynges ben besiliche iseye, 
a wise duÞe of an oost 
may knowe atte folle gif it is to doynge to geue a bataille. 
For gif ķei seen 
ķat he hymself haue inow of ķe forseyde condicions oķer failleķ, 
so he may bere hymself touchynge ķe bataille. 
But on caas neuere alle ķe v Book III PartIII 
forseide condiciouns ben al ifere 
in Þe oo syde; 
nathales where ķe moo 
and ķe betere condicions beķ ifere, 
ķat partie is ķe bettre partie to figte, 
as it is playnliche iknowe to hym ķat taÞeķ heede. Chapter X Alwey a vertue is strengere whanne it is iooned ķan whanne it is departed and ischad. 
And som tyme it happeķ ķat whanne a bataille 
is ido ķe orders and schiltromes 
ben destrubled and ischad. 
A n d for ķat scholde not falle, 
it was ivsed in olde tyme 
ķat ķe oost 
scholde be deled 
in rowtes and schiltroms. 
And eche hadde a baner 
so ķat in eche baner 
by lettres oķer by oķere signes 
Þat were iknowe it scholde be knowe 
of what rowte oķer 
of what schiltrom ķat baner was; 
so ķat gif it happed ķat eny figtyng man went out of his owne schiltrom, 
he mygte by suche a banere sone 
knowe his owne schiltrome 
and come agen ķerto. 
Panne it is good in batailles 
to haue baners, penouns, and penseis, and signes, 
ķat ķe oost 
be not isched noķer imedled oķere wise ķan it scholde. 
Also it is spedful in bataille 
to haue duÞes and leders, centeners and vynteners, 
and oķere ouereseers of bataile. 
| For ķe hoole oost 
is ilikned f. to o body; 
wherfore as al ķe membres of oon body 
he[l]peth eche oķer, 
so alle Þe figtynge men 
and alle ķe partees of ķe same oost scholde defende and helpe eche oķer. 
Wherfore as ķe worÞes of membres 
ben ischend and iconfunded 
but ķei ben irewled by ķe heed 
in ķe whiche is witte and knowyng, 
so figtynge men in an oost ben confunded 
but ķei hauen a certeyne ledere 
ķat scholde be heere heed and rewelere. 
Perfore in olde tyme 
for suche confusioun 
scholde not falle in bataille, 
on was iordeyned duÞe and ledere and maistere of aile ķe oost. 
A n d vndere ķat duk were oķere leders 
ķat were icleped centuriones, 
and vnder hem were oķere ķat were icleped decani. 
And decanus haķ ķe name of decern, ten, 
as centurio haķ ķe name of centum, an hundred. 
And centurio haķ vnder hym decanus 
so ķat he is ouer an hundred figtynge men 
and ouer ten decanus, 
and eche decanus vnder hym ten men. 
A n d in ķe basnet of centurio 
were letters iwrete 
by ķe whiche eche decanus 
knewe his owne centurio 
and wiste wham he scholde folwe. 
Also in ķis basenet decanus 
was a certeyne signe 
iprented 
by ķe whiche ķe ten figtynge men 
ķat were 
vnder hym knewe here owne decanus. 
And in ķis manere oķer wise in schiltroms, 
boķe of hors men and of foot men, 
scholde be iordeyned duÞes and leders and banyours 
so ķat eche mygte wete what he scholde doo. 
A n d in bataille is so greet drede and affray 
for noyse of roschynge of ärmere 
and for smytynge ķat wordes 
mowe not suffice 
to rewle ķe figtynge men; 
but ķer nedeķ certeyne signes ļ 
so ķat eche may knowe coi. 
oonliche by sighte 
how ķei scholde holde hym 
in ķe schiltrom 
and what ķei scholde do. 
A n d hereby it may be knowe what men scholde r bere baners and penouns and oķere signes. 
For gif baners and signes ben ibrook, 
al ķe puple is ischent. 
Panne with greet besynesse ķe baniour 
scholde be chose 
so ķat he scholde be strong of body, 
stedefast of herte, 
trewe to ķe prince, expert and kunnynge in armes, 
and haue oķere condicions 
ķat nedeķ 
to an orpede and noble werriour. 
And it fil in oure tyme ķat al ķe puple of a citee was ouercome by fewe werriours 
by fraude of ķe baniour 
ķat hidde ķe banyre. 
Wherfore ķe figtynge men 
were ischent as men ķat hadde non heed noķer wiste 
wherto ķei scholde taÞe heede. 
Wherfore gif in bataille 
manye men 
ben in perelle of deķ, 
wik greet besynesse 
ķe banoure scholde Þe chose. 
Also herby it may be iknowe what man scholde be ledere 
in an oost 
ouer hors men 
and also ouer foot men. 
For as ķe heed is more worÞ 
ķan oķere lymes, 
so in a bataille ķe most worthi werriour 
scholde be ouer Þe rowtes 
Þat nedeķ to figtynge. 
Panne for foot men 
scholde be good werriours, 
Þei scholde be strong and mygty and of good stature, 
and konnynge to krowe Schaftes and dartes; 
and also ķei scholde kunne brandische and schaÞe a swerd for to smyte, 
and turne his scheid 
aboute to defende hymself; 
and Þei scholde haue a ligt eye, 
and be swift, 
and sobre, 
and kunnynge in ärmere. 
And al ķes condiciounes nedeķ 
to be more parfitliche 
in hym ķat is ouer figtynge foot men. 
Panne he ķat is ouer figtynge foot | 
in figtynge scholde be strong and mygty, 
greet of stature, 
connynge to krowe Schaftes and dartes, 
and to figte and to smyte wik a swerd, 
and byturne aboute his scheide to defende hymself. 
A n d ķei scholde haue ligt eyge and be sobre, 
and haue al experience of ärmere 
ķat ķei kunne teche to figtynge men 
ķat ben vnder hem and maÞe hem 
figte wel and scowre here ärmere. 
For brigtnesse and schenyng of ärmere fereķ enemyes so ķat he ķat bereķ suche ärmere 
is iholde a good werriour. 
And rousty ärmere is toÞene of vnkonnynge of hym ķat bereķ suche ärmere. 
Panne gif he ķat scholde be ouer fot men in figtynge scholde be ex­ pert and konnynge in ärmere and be suche on as we hauen discreued, 
moche more he scholde be konnynge 
in ärmere and moche of body 
and strong and mygti ķat scholde be ouer an oost in bataile of hors men. 
For in suche a bataille 
is more strong figtynge ķanne in figtynge of foot men. 
Panne ķe souerayne and ledere of bataille of knygtes 
mote be swift of body 
ķat he may lepe swiftliche to hors iarmed, 
and cunne ride swyftliche, 
smyte wik a spere, 
and krowe dartes, 
and defende hymself 
with his scheid, 
and figt with maas and wik swerd, 
and haue al connynge of ärmere ķat he may teche his knygtes 
to figte strongliche, 
and maÞe hem scoure here ärmere, 
and do oķere dedes ķat nedeķ to bataylle.

And as it longeķ to ķis doynge we may reÞene eigte cautels

Panne for boschementg of enemyes

After ķat we hauen iseid 
where vnder doyng of bataille is conteyned, 
and in what contrées ben best werriours, 
and of what craftes ben best figtynge men, 
and hauen also declared 
how in an oost scholde be maad strengķe and castels, 
and what thinges scholde be knowe gif me scholde figte 
in bataille of areste, 
and what cautels Þe duk of batailles 
scholde haue to saue his oost wikoute greef 
in weyes touchinge felde bataille, 
it semeķ ķat it nedeķ telle no more 
but Þat we teche to ordeyne schiltroms 
to smyte enemyes 
and to rese on hem. 
But first we schal telle of ķe ordres of schiltroms; 
for gif Þe ordre of schiltroms 
is isaued in bataille, 
it helpeķ moche to figtynge men. 
For as Vigesius | seith, 
but figtynge men 
ben iordeyned 
in a Þew col. space, 
Þei mowe not wel figte. 
For gif ķei ben to strayte iset, 
Þei ben ilet 
Þat Þei mow not smyte Þe enemyes. 
And gif Þei ben isette to kynne and to fer atwynne, 
Þanne Þe enemyes mow come withinne hem 
and breÞeÞe scheltrom 
and ouercome hem. 
A n d withoute greet vse 
it may not be ķat hors men and foot men 
hoolde hem wel in Þe ordre 
in here schiltroms. 
Panne he Þat w o l werre in eny tyme scholde longe tyme tofore vse his figtynge men 
to holde Þew ordre in schiltrom. 
A n d in ķe manere 
by ķe whiche figtynge men scholde Þepe hem in suche ordre it is so 
Þat boķe hors men and foot men scholde ofte come in to Þe feldes. 
And he Þat is ivsed in bataille 
and scholde be mayster 
ouer hors men and foot men scholde firste sette hors men 
and foot men are we, 
as it were by a lyne, 
so Þat Þei stonde arewe and iliche fer atwynne 
by ķe space 
ķat nedeķ for schiltrom of hors men 
oķer of foot men. 
Perafter he schal ordeyne double schiltrom 
so Þat half Þe schiltrom 
be anon departed 
fro Þe oķer half 
and be iordeyned 
arewe tofore oķer byhynde ķe oķer half. 
A n d whanne ķat is ido, 
anon ķe duÞe schal hoot to maÞe 
a quadrate schiltrom 
and ķanne to maÞe a triangle, 
Þre cornerd, 
and Þat may be sone ido. 
For in a quadrible schiltrom gif Þe dyameter is forkytte 
and Þe quadrate parties iioyned togeders, 
ķanne ķei maÞen a triangle. 
But for not alle men 
vnderstondeķ 
Þis maner of géométrie, 
taÞeķ alle for oon menynge 
Þat whanne Þe figtyng men ben ibrougt 
in to ķe feeld, 
boķe | hors men and foot men, 
ķe duÞe of ķe bataille schal f. hoote to ordeyne a schiltrom ischape as a quadrangle and ķerafter 
as a triangle 
and ķanne round and so of oķere. 
A n d so Þei scholde vse figtynge men 
to könne maÞe schiltrom 
of al manere schap. 
For ķes kynges ben iknowe, 
it is to wetynge 
ķat among schappes of schiltroms 
quadrangle schap is lest work. 
Perfore of ķis schap 
scholde neuere schiltrom 
be ischape withoute special cause, 
as gif it happeķ 
Þat Þe place axek such a schap; 
and in suche a caas a schiltrom 
scholde be r ischape. 
And profitable schappes [of] schiltroms 
for to figte 
ben schap of a schild, 
al round, 
and ķe schap 
of a schere oķer 
of an hors schoo. 
For figtynge men 
w o l oonliche defende hemself 
and suffre stroÞes oķer 
Þei wolle assaille oķere. 
A n d gif figtynge men felen hemself 
not strong inow to assaille ķe enemyes 
but ķat it is inow 
for hem to defende hemself, 
ķanne ķe schiltrom 
schal be maad al round and figtynge men schal be sette ķikÞe so 
ķat ķe schiltrom 
may not be broÞe. 
And aboute ķe scheltrom 
in ķe ende ķerof 
and in ķe ottere side scholde be sette men wik heuy ärmere 
and ben iarmed 
ķat may best fonge stroÞes withoute greef. 
And gif ķe figtynge men feleķ hemself stronge inow to assaye ķe enemyes, 
ķanne by ķe proporcioun of hem 
as ķei ben moo oķer lees, 
ķe schiltrom scholde be schape 
as a schere so 
ķat ķe schiltrom 
scholde be open as an hors schoo oķere 
as a scheere for to taÞe and close inne ķe enemyes. 
A n d gif ķe enemyes ben manye, 
ķe schiltrom scholde be schape 
as a scheid | 
ķat it may departe 
and dele ķe enemyes. col. 
For whanne ķe enemyes ben departed, 
ķei ben ķe sonnere ouercome. 
Panne a round schiltrom 
is good 
and to susteyne and to defende; 
and schiltrom ischape 
as a scheere is good* 
to close and byclippe enemyes 
whanne ķei ben fewe; 
and a schiltrom ischape as a scheid is good to departe 
and to dele enemyes 
whanne Þei ben manye. 
Panne it is to wetynge 
ķat ķe nombre of schiltroms 
scholde be iordeyned 
by ķe multitude of figtynge men. 
For as ķe duk haķ mo +figt­ ynge men oÞer lees, 
he may ordeyne mo schiltroms oķer lees. 
And it is to wetynge 
ķat alwey 
in a corner of a schiltrom, 
oķer in place where most perel may falle leste ķe schiltrom be toschad 
oķer imedled oķer wise ķan it scholde, 
scholde be sette best werriours 
ķat may beste figte. 
And so it is to wetynge ķat in eche schiltrom, 
al wikoute figtynge men ķat ben in Þe schiltrom, 
som noble and orpede figtynge men scholde be ordeyned wikoute Þe schiltrom 
ķat Þey mowe helpe ķe schiltrom 
gif it failleķ in eny place. 
And ķes Þre scholde be Þept in ordeynyng of schiltroms. First, 
Þat Þe schiltrom 
be wel iordeyned ischape al round oķer 
as a scheid oķer as a schere, 
as it nedeķ for Þe bataile 
Þat schal be geue. Pe seconde, 
Þat Þe beste figtynge men ben i[s]ette 
in ķilÞe place of Þe schiltrom 
in Þe whiche Þe schiltrom 
mygt sonnest be broÞe. Pe ķridde, 
Þat wikoute eche schiltrom be iordeyned 
som boolde knygtes and stronge ķat may helpe ķat partie of ķe schiltrom 
ķat is feeble and fayllek. 
Capitulum terciodecimum tercii libri partis tercii. | Chapter XIII 
For it is declared 
how schiltromes scholde be ordeyned and isett, 
it is to declarynge 
how figtynge men scholde figte and smyte, 
and wheÞer f. v Book III PartIII 
it is better to smyte drawynge oķer stokynge. 
And we may preue by fyue weyes 
Þat Þei ben to scornynge 
ķat smyten drawynge 
and Þat it is best to smyte stokynge and foynynge. 
Pe firste wey is itaÞe by lette of ärmere, 
ķe seconde by lette of boones, 
Þe ķridde by warnesse of wondes, 
Þe ferķe by traueille of lymes, 
Þe fifte by vnhelyng of hem 
Þat smyten. 
Pe firste is declared in Þis wise. 
For Þe [more] 
a swerd taÞeķ of Þe ärmere, 
for lettyng of Þe ärmere 
Þe hardere it is to come to Þe flesch. 
A n d ķerfore wise figtynge men 
Þat hauen experience of bataille meneķ ķat alwey figtynge men scholde haue large haburiounis 
so ķat rynges of haboriones 
scholde be constreyned togeders; 
for ķe more kykÞe ķe ringes ben isette, ķe more ķerof mote breÞe gif wondes scholde greue. 
So for ķei ķat smyten drawynge 
mote forkytte more of ķe ärmere ķan ķei ķat smyten stokynge and foynyng gif ķe wondes scholde come to ķe flesche, 
ķanne it is better to smyte foynynge ķanne drawynge. 
A n d a litel Þeruyng of ärmere suffiseķ to herte 
Þe flesche smytyng foynyng 
ķat suffiseķ not smytynge drawynge. 
Pe seconde wey to preue Þe same 
is itaÞe by lettynge of bones. 
For ķei a man be 
as it were vnarmed in smytynge drawynge, 
ar me come to ķe herte 
and to Þe membres of lif, 
moste a greet wonde be maad 
and manye bones forkytte. 
But smytynge foynynge twey ynches suffiseķ to deķ wounde. 
Panne we schal taÞe hede 
Þat al Þat is greuous to oure enemyes 
is profitable to vs. 
Perfore in an oost 
ķer men fondeķ to | slee, 
col. me scholde figte foynyng; 
for smytynge in Þat wise deeķ wounde 
is sonnest igeue. 
Pe ķridde is itaÞe 
by warnesse of wondes. 
For ķe more waar Þe enemy is of wondes, 
Þe bettre he may defende hym 
and voide hem ķe sonnere. 
For gif a man is iwaar of dartes, Þe dartes greueķ Þe lasse. 
A n d in smytynge drawynge, 
for ķer mot bee greet meuynge of armes 
ar ķe strook come to ķe enemye, 
he may be longe waar of ķe woundes; 
he may ķerfore be ķe more waar 
and defende hymself fro stroÞes. 
Perfore Vigesius seith 
ķat smytynge foynynge 
ķe enemye feleķ ķe strook 
er he see it comynge. 
Perfore knygtes of Rome 
vsede principaliche 
ķis manere smytynge 
and smote seide drawynge, 
for ķei wolde alwey smyte foynyng. 
Pe ferķe wey is itaÞe 
by traueile of lymes. 
For among oķere thinges in bataille, 
ķat scholde be principaliche iknowe how figtynge men 
wik­ oute greet traueille mowe greue here enemyes. 
For gif figtynge men trauelen tofore 
and mowe not dure ķat traueille, 
ķei forsaÞen ķe schil­ trom 
and bygynnen to flee. 
Panne for in smytynge drawynge 
is greet traueile 
by cause of meuyng of armes 
and in smytynge foynynge litel traueille suffiseķ, 
ķanne it is bettere to smyte foynyng ķan drawyng. 
<For> a drawyng strook sleek 
but seide ķeig it come with greet strengķe; 
but a foynyng strook ķei it come 
wik litel strengķe geueķ deķes wonde. 
Pe fifte wey is itaÞe 
by vnhelyng of hym ķat smytek. 
For a good wer­ riour scholde so smyte his enemye gif he may so 
ķat he be not ihurt. 
Panne alle | suche manere smytyng 
is best in ķe whiche he ķat smytek 
f. is leest vnheled, 
for in suche smytyng 
may falle lest hertynge. 
Panne for smytyng foynynge 
and with Þe body yheled 
may be lest hertynge, 
betere it is to smyte foynyng 
Þan drawyng. 
For in smytynge drawyng 
it nedeķ to heue vp ķe rigt arme; 
and whanne ķe rigt arme is vp, 
Þe rigt side is naÞed 
and vnheled 
and ķe enemy haķ mater to herte 
and greue ķe sonnere. 
For ķe body ķat is naÞed is sonnere ihert and igreued ķan ķe body ķat is iheled. 
r Chapter XIV 
And as it is iseid tofore, 
what is profitable to enemyes 
is greuous to vs and agenward. 
Panne al Þat maÞeķ 
Þe enemyes stronge 
to withstonde figtynge men 
is profitable to hem. 
Perfore Þe contrarie 
is greuous to hem 
and maÞeķ hem feble to wikstonde figtynge men. 
And as it longeķ to ķis doyng, 
we may reÞene seuene ķat maÞeķ enemyes more strong 
Þan Þe oÞer partie. 
Pe firste is gif ķei ben wel iordeyned in Þe schiltrom. 
For as it is iseid tofore, 
a vertue is more strong whanne it is ioned 
ķan whanne it is departed. 
Pan gif enemyes 
ben wel ioned 
and wel iordeyned and isette 
in good ordre in schiltrom, 
gif Þei ben assailled, 
ķei ben Þe hardere to be ouercome. 
Pe seconde Þat maÞeķ enemyes stronge to wikstonde is place; 
for in oo place enemyes 
mow betere defende hemself ķan in anoķer. 
For in passyng of reueres 
and among huiles and monteyns 
and in strayte weyes, 
‡ gif ķei ben ifounde in suche place, 
it is hard to hem for to defende hemself for ķei mot goo sparpoyled and | departed. 
Wherfore col. gif enemyes ben ifounde in place 
ķat is not defensable, 
Þe place maÞeķ hem 
Þe more feble to figte. 
So a place of defence maÞeķ hem 
Þe more strong to wikstonde. 
Pe ķridde [is] tyme. 
For whanne ķe wynd is agenste enemyes 
and whanne poudre is iblow in here eygen 
and whanne ķe sonne beem is in here face, 
enemyes mowe ķe worse wikstonde. 
And whanne ķe contrarie herof falleķ, 
enemyes ben Þe more strong to figte. 
Pe ferķe Þat maÞeķ enemyes Þe more bolde and ķe more redy to figte is warnynge. 
For whanne ķei ben waar and avised and knowek tofore ķe comynge of enemyes, 
a ļ maÞen hem ķe more strong and dreden ķe lasse ķe metynge of hem. 
Pe fifte is skilful reste. 
For whanne enemyes 
ben wery of traueile and igreued 
wik wakyng and wik oķere deseses, 
gif ķei ben ķanne assailled, 
ķei ben sonnere ouercome ķanne Þey scholde gif ķei hadde skilful reste. 
Panne skilful reste 
maÞeķ enemyes 
ķe more strong and mygty. Book III PartIII 
Pe sixte is loue and accorde of hemself. 
For gif enemyes ķat ben bodiliche departed 
ben Þe sonnere ouercome, 
moche more gif ķei ben departed in loue and in wille 
ķei ben Þe sonnere ouercome. 
For departyng and deuysioun of loue and of wille is more ķanne deuysioun of bodies. 
A n d % agenward gif enemyes ben bodiliche ioned, 
Þei ben Þe strengere to fite; 
and moche more gif Þei louen eche oķer 
and ben ioned 
in loue and in wille, 
for ķanne |‡he tristeķ 
ķe more to eche oķer f. [and] Þey ben Þe more strong

For eche loue is a certeyne vertue of onynge, 
and loue oneķ more Þe hertes of hem 
ķat loueķ ķanne vnyte of place oneķ 
Þe bodyes of hem ķat ben ķere inne. 
Wherfore gif vnytee of place and gederyng of figtyng men maÞen hem 
Þe more strong and mygty, 
loue and vnyte of hertes 
maÞeķ hem ķe more manlich and strong. 
v Pe seuenķe ķat maÞeķ enemyesÞe more strong to wikstonde [i]s [vn]k[n]owynge

and of here owne doynge. 
For ķe better Þe condicions of enemyes ben iknowe, 
ķe ligtere we[y] may be chese

A n d Þe more vnknowe is here doynge, 
ķe more vnknowe is ķe manere to asseyle hem. 
A n d so for thinges 
ben ireÞened ķat maÞeķ ķe enemyes

it may be sone iknowe how 
and in what wise wer­ riours 
scholde falle on here enemyes. 
For in seuene manere doynges 
ķat ben ireÞened ene[m]yes ben ķe more strong, 
whanne ķei ben in ķe contrarie manere of doyng

Panne firste,

ķe duÞe of ķe bataille scholde besyliche aspie whanne ķe enemyes ben departed. 
A n d ķanne ķei scholde asaile hem, 
for ķanne ķei hauen no mygt to wikstonde. 
Pe seconde, [ķei] scholde besiliche aspie here weyes; 
as whanne he passede ryuers 
and strayte weyes among monteyns oķer among wodes oķere euel weyes 
of mareys and mores, 
ķanne Þei scholde falle on enemyes 
for <so> [epeliche] ķei ben ouercome. 
Pe ķridļde,

as whanne ķe sonne is col.

ķanne ķei scholde sette on hem. 
For here eygen ben iblend wik ķe sonne and igreued

And ķerfore hem nedeķ to turne ķe bak and be agoo. 
Pe ferķe,

ķe duk of ķe bataille schal by hymself oķer by oķer

For whan ķat is ido, 
for noon of hem tristeķ to oķer, 
gif ķei ben assailled

But ķei Vigesius sette ķis cautel, 
it is litel work, 
for it is contrarie to goode maners and Þewes.

We seide in ķe chapitre 
tofore ķat it is to smytyng foynynge

In ķis chapitre we w o l geue special loore to foot men,

Þat we may Þe more strongliche schaÞe and krowe ķe dart. Book III PartIII 
But whanne we figten hond 
at honde with swerd, 
we schul do agen­ ward 
and sette fork agenward 
ķe rigt foot 
and wikdrawe ķe lift foot. 
For ķe rigt side 
is more able to meuynge, 
gif ķat side is next to ķe enemye 
by cause of meuynge 
it may ķe bettere voide stroÞes; 
for kyng ķat moueķ not is hardere 
ismete ķan kyng ķat meueķ. 
Also gif ķe rigt side 
is next to ķe enemye, 
it may ķe bettere smyte. 
For whanne figtynge men figten hond at hond, 
ķe J lift foot scholde not meue; 
and whan ķei w o l smyte, 
ķei scholde sette fork ķe rigt foot; 
and whanne Þey wollen voide ķe stroÞes, 
Þey scholde wikdrawe ķe same rigt foot. 
And so stondynge on ķe lift foot 
and settyng fork 
and wikdrawynge ķe rigt foot, 
ķei moste smyte ķe better stroÞes 
and ķe better voide ķe stroÞes. 
For it is iknowe how figtynge men schulde st[onde] 
whanne ķei schulde smyte enemyes, 
it is to declarynge 
h o w enemyes 
scholde be clipped and iclosed. 
Panne it is to wetynge 
ķat seide oķer neuer enemyes 
scholde be so iclipped and closed % 
in bataille of arestē ķat ķei haue no wey 
for to flee. 
For ķanne ķei knowen non oķer socour 
but ķat ķei mot nedes 
figte oķer be deed 
and ben ķerfore hardy. 
A n d knowyng Þat Þei mot nedes deyge, 
Þei 
m[ow]e do moche harme to hem 
Þat figten wik hem. 
Perfore Cipiones sen|tens is ipreysed, 
for he seide ķat neuere enemyes f. scholde be so iclosed and icleped ķat ķei haue no wey for to fle. 
For ķei enemyes flee, 
it is no perel. 
Also in ķe fligt manye of hem 
ben in peril and ilost wikowte here stroÞes ķat chaseķ hem. 
A n d gif ķei seen ķat ķei ben icleped and iclosed, 
ķei ben as it were constrayned and compelled to figte wik here enemyes ķat clo<s>en hem. 
Panne for we seide ķat som tyme a schiltrom 
scholde be ischape 
as a schere 
as whan enemyes ben fewe for to byclippe hem 
and close hem ķe betere, 
it schal not be vnderstonde so ķat enemyes schul be so iclosed and iclipped ķat Þei haue no wey for to flee 
but ķei ben so fewe ķat ķei mowe do noon harme ķei he be neuere so rebel. 
For it is declared how figtynge foot men 
scholde stonde to smyte here enemyes 
and how enemyes scholde be byclipped and closed, 
now, ķe ķridde, 
it is to declarynge how figtynge % scholde be voided gif ķer lakÞeķ counsaille 
oķer gif it semeķ ķat it is not good 
to geue batayle for enemyes beķ to manye 
and we mowe not wikstonde hem. 
In ķe whiche caas 
as it longeķ to ķis doynge ķe duÞe of ķe bataille scholde haue double cautel. 
Pe first, 
touchinge his owne oost. 
For gif ķe duk haķ counsaille 
ķat it is not to doynge for to figte, 
git rigt fewe scholde wete ķerof. 
A n d not al ķe oost 
scholde wete ķerof 
lest Þei drede and flee awey schameliche 
and be kylde of enemyes 
ķat pursewen hem. 
Also ķe duÞe scholde so bere hym ķat ķe oost trowe not ķat he wolde flee 
but ķat he | w o l araye col. boschementes agenste ķe enemyes 
and figte wik hem in oķer place. 
v Pe seconde cautel is touchyng ķe oost of enemyes. 
For gif ķei w o l voide ķe bataille, 
for to maÞe Þat vnknowe to ķe enemyes 
ķerfore manye by nygtes more ķan by dayes don so. 
A n d manye hauen ivsed ķis cautel 
ķat knygtes stondyng 
in Þe schiltrom 
aforne ķe enemyes schulde lette ķe enemyes 
to see ķe foot men; 
wherfore ķe foot men passen awey preuelyche. 
A n d whanne ķei ben agoo, 
afterward hors men mowe ķe better voide periles and stroÞes of enemyes. 
And it is to wetynge 
ķat whanne a bataille 
is so ivoided, 
ķe schiltrom scholde not be departed. 
For gif enemyes pursewen hem ķat flien fro ķe bataille, 
ķei wolde slee moo 
and do hem more harme ķan ķeig he turnede agen for to figte. 
And so ķe duÞe of ķe bataille 
scholde inquire gif ķer is eny place nyg to ķe whiche ķe oost 
may flee anj it be ichased wik enemyes. Chapter XVI 
Hit semeķ ķat alle batailles 
ben reducte and ibrougt to foure maners of batailes: 
ķe batailes of feeld, of sege, of defence, and of schippes. 
And bataille of feld is icleped al figtynge ķat is in ground 
in ķe whiche men figteķ togeders 
wikoute strenķe of closynge bytwene hem. 
And ķe lasse strengķe of closynge is bytwene hem, 
ķe more verreyliche it is icleped bataille of feld 
and is Þe more perelous. 
Pe seconde manere of figtynge 
is icleped obcessiuum, 
a sege, 
whanne figtynge men ben so strong 
ķat ķei abyden not forto ķe enemyes come out of here strengķe to figte wik hem | in ķe felde, 
but ķei fallen on ķe strengķe 
and bysege hem ķerinne. 
A n d suche figtynge is comynliche icleped obcessiuum, 
figtynge of sege. 
And ķe ķridde manere figtynge may be cleped defensiuum, 
figtynge of defence. 
For as som tyme figtynge men ben so manye 
and so strong 
ķat ķei abyden not forto ķe enemyes come out 
in to ķe feld 
but ķei assayllen and bysegen ķe strengķe, 
so som tyme figtynge men ben so fewe and so feble 
ķat ķei trowen 
not ķat ķei mowe wikstonde ķe enemyes 
in ķe felde 
and holden hem ķerfore iclosed in strengķe. 
A n d it is inow to hem 
to defende ķe strengķe gif ķei ben assailed of enemyes. 
And suche figtyng in ķe which men defenden strengķes and castels 
is icleped defensiuum; 
for ķei in eche figtynge 
be som asailynge and som defence, 
gut whanne men bysegen strengķes and castels, 
it is more propreliche iseid 
ķat ķei assaillen oķere men ķanne ķat ķei defenden. 
And in figtynge of defence 
is not assaillyng but defence. 
Perfore suche figtynge 
is icleped defensiuum, 
figtyng of defence. 
Pe ferķe manere bataille 
oķer figtynge 
is icleped a bataille of schippes. 
For as figtynge is in ķe londe, 
so is figtyng in watre. 
A n d figtyng in watre is more orible and perelous ķan figtynge in ķe lond. 
A n d suche f. i r Book III PartIII figtynge in water, 
what maner water it euere be, 
is icleped bataille of schippes. 
Wherfore gif Þer ben foure manere of figtynge, 
after ķat we hauen ispoÞe of figtyng of feld, 
it is to spekynge of figtynge of sege, of defence, and of schippes. 
A n d som tyme kynges and prynces figten 
in Þes maners of figtynge, 
for som tyme ķei geuen bataille 
in ķe feld and | by- col. 
segen som tyme strengķes and castels. 
Also som tyme som men asaylen strenķes and castels of oķere men; 
ķerfore hem nedeķ 
to vse figtynge of defence. 
Also in principate and in regne ben hauenes and lond nyg ķe see. 
Perfore lest hauenes be destroyed 
and lest enemyes come Þerby in to ķe regne 
and lestÞe lond ķat is nyg ķe see be destroyed, 
it is spedful to kynges and princes 
to ordeyne batailles of schippes. 
Also for it is ispoÞe of bataille of felde, 
it is to spekynge of oķere manere batailles. 
A n d for we hauen ispoÞe largeliche of bataille of felde 
and ireÞened manye cautels of batailes - 
for by thinges ķat ben iseid 
it is iknowe ķat in alle manere batailles 
mowe be cautels how men scholde bere hem 
and in what wise - 
now it nedeķ to abyde lengere aboute oķere manere batailles. 
But first we schal speÞe of bataille of sege. 
Panne for it is iknowe 
how manye manere of batailles ķer ben, 
and iseide after bataille of feld 
it is first to spekyng of figtyng of sege 
(for by suche figtynge strengķes, castels, citées, 
and wallede townes ben itaÞe), 
it is to spekynge 
in how manye manere wyse suche strengķes mow be ouercome and itaÞe. 
A n d in ķre manere wise strengķes and castels 
mowe be taÞe: 
by ķurst, hunger and figtynge. 
For som tyme ķei ķat ben byseged 
lakÞen water and mote ķerfore deyge for ķurst 
oķer gelde vp ķe strengķe. 
Wherfore Þei Þat bysegen 
eny strengķes mote besiliche 
byÞenÞe gif ķei mowe 
by eny quyntyse oķer by sleyÞe 
byneme here water 
ķat is byseged. 
For | ofte it happeķ 
f. ķat water comeķ 
fro ferre welles to ķe strengķe ķat ben byseged. 
Wher­ fore gif ķe pipe 
and ķe condite 
by ķe whiche suche water comeķ to hem ķat ben byseged is destroyed 
at ķe welle heed, 
ķanne Þey ķat ben byseged 
mote nedes haue defaute of water. 
Also som strengķes stonden hige and hauen no water 
comyng fro ferre welles. 
Panne ķei ķat bysegen hem scholde do al besynesse to knowe 
in what wise ķei m o w byneme here water 
ķat ben byseged. 
Pe seconde manere of takynge of strengķes is by honger, 
for wik­ oute mete we may not dure. 
Perfore he ķat bysegek strengķes 
for to taÞe hem scholde besiliche Þepe paas and weyes 
and alle places 
by Þe whiche mete mygte be brougt hem, 
and Þepe besiliche ķat no mete be brougt to hem. 
For ofte in suche seges honger doķ more harme ķan swerdes. 
Perfore ofte tyme ķei ķat bysegen 
and w o l sone taÞe ķe strengķes gif Þei taÞen eny of hem 
ķat ben byseged 
Þey sleek hem not, 
but maymek hem and maÞeķ hem 
vnable to figte and sendeķ hem 
v ķanne to ķe strengķes ķat is byseged 
for to ete ķer wyth hem 
ķat ben byseged 
and to maÞe hem haue Þe more defaute and honger. 
Pe ķridde manere of takynge of strengķes 
is by figtynge, as whanne me comeķ to ķe walles 
for to figte wik hem ķat ben byseged. 
But how and in how manye manere wise 
suche figtynge scholde be, 
it schal be declared in Þe nexte chapitre. 
For it is declared how manye maner batailles 
ķer ben 
and in how manye manere wise strengķes 
Þat ben byseged ben itaÞe, 
| it is to declar- col. 
enge what tyme it is best to bysege castels and citées. 
A n d so it is to wetynge ķat in somer tyme, 
Þat er corne and wyne ben gedred 
and oķere kynges ķat neden to here liflode ķat ben byseged, 
[it is best to sette a sege]. 
For in Þat tyme 
in al maner takynge of strengķes 
Þe strengķe is best itaÞe and Þei ķat ben byseged ben ouercome. 
For gif strengķes ben itaÞe by krist, 
it is best to sette a sege in somer tyme. 
For ķanne is most defaute of water 
and ķanne is not moche rayne 
ķat may be cisternes 
helpe hem ķat ben byseged. 
Also gif castels and citées 
ben itaÞe by honger, 
it is best to sette a sege in somer tyme. 
For comynliche ķanne faillen fruyt of ķe gere ķat is agoo. 
Wherfore gif ķei ķat ben byseged 
mowe not haue ķe fruyt of ķe gere 
Þat is present, 
ķei ben Þe sonnere ispilt for defaute and for honger. 
Also gif strengķes ben itaÞe by bataille 
and by figtynge, 
it is best to do it in somer tyme. 
For in wynter tyme is moche rayne 
and diches ben ful of water, 
wherfore it is ķe more ‡ hard to assaille hem 
Þat ben byseged. 
Also desese of tyme greueķ more hem 
Þat bysegek 
and ben in ķeķ feld Þan hem 
at ben byseged and ben in hous. 
Panne seges scholde be isette in somer tyme. 
Oķer gif seges schal dure longe tyme, 
Þey scholde nameliche be bygonne in somer tyme 
ar ķei ķat ben byseged mowe gedre corn and wyne and oķere fruyt of ķe erķe. Chapter XVII öif men ķat bysegen ben necligent and strengtheķ 
not hemsilf besiliehe, 
men ķat ben byseged may greue hem. 
For whanne a sege dureķ longe tyme, 
it is not possible ķat men of ķe sege be al|wey ileche 
w e l arayed and redy to figte. 
Perfore but ķei haue strengķe aboute hem 
whanne ķei ben aslepe oķer atte mete oķer in oķer nedes, 
men of ķe castel breÞen sodeynliche out vpon hem 
and brennen here tentes and destroyen here 
gynnes and som tyme sleen manye of ķe sege. 
Panne for to be siÞer, 
ķe sege scholde by sette and tentes 
ipigt fer fro Þe place 
ķat is byseged - namelich as fer as Þe fligt of a dart 
oķer of an arwe. 
And ķe men of Þe sege scholde 
maÞe diches aboute hem and piche ķerinne staÞes and poles 
and maÞe torettes and pynacles 
so ķat gif ķe men 
ķat ben byseged wolde sodeynliche assaille hem, 
ķei mowe fynde lette. f. i r Book III PartIII 
For it is iknowe how men of a sege scholde maÞe hem strengte for ķei ķat ben byseged scholde not greue hem, 
it is to declarynge in h 
o w manye manere wise ķei mow assaille hem ķat ben byseged. 
A n d oon manere of assaillynge is comyne: 
wik arblasters, 
wik bowes, 
and with stones ikrowe wik hondes 
and with slynges, 
and wik ladders isette to ķe strengķe. 
if ķei ķat ben byseged comen to ķe walles and penacles, 
if men of ķe sege ben connyng in figtynge, 
anoun Þey wolle assayle hem wik arblastes and bowes and wik stones ikrowe w i k hondes and wik slenges 
and sette ladders to ķe walles. 
A l wikoute ķes maners of assaylyng and sautes 
ben ķre maners of sautes 
and of assaylyng 
ķat may be knowe to alle men. 
O n ķerof is by mynes 
and by weyes vnder erķe, 
and anoķer by engynes krowyng grete stones and heuye, 
and ķe ķridde is by buldynge ischift to ķe walles 
of ķe strengķe ķat is byseged. 
And of al ķes maners of asayllynge and sautes | 
we schal speÞe and first col. of assaylyng by weyes vnder erķe. 
A n d first strengķes ben itaÞe by mynes 
and weyes vnder erķe. 
For Þey ķat ben in ķe sege scholde pryueyliche 
in som place delue and digge in ķe erķe, 
and ķei scholde sette tofore ķat place 
a tente oķer som oķer buldyng so Þat Þei 
Þat ben byseged mow not isee 
where ķat Þei bygynnen to delue. 
A n d ķere deluyng 
and mynyng and makyng weyes vnder erķe 
as mynours doķ ķat mynen siluer and fynden veynes of metal, 
ķei schulde maÞe ķulÞe weyes deppere ķan ķe diches and walles of ķe strengķe ķei schal betaÞe and come by suche weyes anon to ķe walles of ķe forseide strengķe. 
A n d if ķat may be do, 
ķe strengķe is sone itaÞe. 
For whanne ķat is ido, 
first ķei scholde vnderfmyrPe ķe walles and vndersette hem 
w i k tymber 
and w i k treen 
ķat ķe walles falle not anon. 
A n d whanne alle ķe walles 
ben so vndermyned and vndersette, 
if ķei ķat ben of ķe sege knowen 
ķat ķe strengķe may be taÞe onliche 
by fallyng of ķe walle, 
ķanne ķei scholde anoon sette ķe tymber 
afuyre ķat vndersetteķ and bereķ ķe wal and maÞe alle ķe walles oķer a greet del ķerof falle al at ones and fille ķe diches. 
A n d whanne ķat is idoo, 
ķei scholde as it were sodeynliche afraye hem 
ķat ben byseged ķat ķe strengķe may ķe sonnere be taÞe. 
A n d it is to wetynge 
ķat alwey ķe weyes vnder erķe scholde be strengķed 
w i k tymber and wik bordes leste ķe erķe falle and Stoffe mynours. 
A n d ķe erķe ķat is idrawe out of 
ķe myne scholde be so preueyliche iļhid 
ķat it be not iseye of hem ķat ben byseged. 
A n d also f. whanne ķe tymber ķat vndersetteķ and holdeķ 
vp ķe walles 
is iset afire, 
he ķat setteķ swiche tymber afuyre mot drawe hem to a siÞer place 
lest he be ihert with fallyng of ķe walle. 
Panne in ķis wise it isto doynge in takynge of strengķes 
by menynge whanne onliche fallyng of Þe walles suffiseķ to taÞe Þe strengķe. 
But whanne me trowek Þat suffiseķ not, 
while Þe walles ben vndermened V īo and vndersette 
Þe tymber scholde not be set afuyre anoon; 
but me scholde passe fiirķere to grettere strengķes 
and to ķe strengest walles 
of castel oķer of citee 
Þat is byseged and do in Þe same wise 
by suche weyes vnder erķe 
as it is ido touchinge ķe walles. 
Also Þe weyes vnder erķe schulde be so turned 
ķat men mow come Þerby 
in to ķe castel oķer citee. 
And al ķis may be do preueyliche wikoute wetyng of hem ķat ben byseged. 
A n d Þey it be not ido wikoute difficultee and longe tyme, 
al ķis may be brout to good ende. 
And whan al ķis is idoo som tyme 
by nyte oķer som oķer tyme 
Þat is couenable to fite Þe tymber scholde be sette afuyre 
Þat holdeķ vp ķe walles 
so ķat alle Þe walles of Þe strengķe fal doun 
at tones and fille ķe diches. 
A n d also me may come 
by weyes vnder erķe, 
and somme of Þe sege may come in to Þe castel oķer citee 
by wey ķat is imaad 
by fallynge of Þe walles. 
And so Þe strengķe ķat is byseged may be taÞe. Chapter XVIII 
And it happeķ often tyme ķat strengķes ķat ben byseged stonden on harde 
sto|nes oķer ben byclipped al aboute wik water so ķat vnneķe col. 
oķer neuere ķei 
mow be taÞe wik menyng. 
Also ofte it happeķ ķat Þei 
a strengķe ķat is byseged 
may be taÞe by menyng, 
it [ķei] ļ ķat ben byseged ben waar of ķe menyng and letteķ it ķat ķei be not gylelich ouercome Þerby. 
And how ķat scholde be do 
we schal teche here 
after in ķe tretes of fityng of defence. 
For whanne it schal be treted 
how ķei ķat ben byseged scholde defende hemself, 
it schal be declared how Þei Þat ben byseged mowe be waar of mynes and of oķere wyles of hem ķat bysegen hem. 
Wherfore if ķe manere of craft scholde folwe kynde ķat alwey bryngek fork kynges by ķe schorteste wey, 
for strengķes ben not so sone itaÞe 
by mynes 
and by engynes and trepegettes ķat krowen stones 
oķer by buldynges 
ischift anoon 
to ķe walles of castel 
oķer of citee ķat is byseged, 
it nedeķ to vse suche argumentes 
for to haue ķe entente. 
Panne it is to wetynge 
how manye maner gynnes ķer ben to krowe stones 
and how manye manere buldynges 
by ķe whiche strengķes ben assayled and itaÞe. 
And Þe gynnes to krowe stones ben reducte as it were to foure manere gynnes. 
For in eche suche maner gyn is som what ķat drawek and rereķ 
Þe erde of Þe gynne to Þe whiche is iioyned 
a slenge ķat krowek stones. 
And suche is ķe reryng of ķe erd som tyme by conterpaise, 
and [oper w h i l e p a t conterpaise

it is ipigt oķer meuable oķer som del ipigt 
and som del meuable. 
And it is iseid 
ķat ķe counterpeyse 
is ipigt whanne in ķe erde is ipit a Book III PartIII 
cassa ķat is fast wiķ|owte meuynge 
to ķe gerd ful of stones oķer of f. \IT grauel oķer of leed oķer of som oķer heuye kynges. 
A n d men in ool tyme clepede ķis manere gyne trabicium. 
A n d among gynnes ķis gynne krowek most euene, 
for alwey ķe contrepeyse drawek ileche. 
Perfore it krowek alwey in ķe same wise 
and wik ķis gyne 
a nedle may be smete. 
For whanne me schal ķenviķ krowe to eny mark, 
gif it krowek to moche 
toward ķe rigt side oķer toward ķe lift side, 
it schal be iturned and isette aforne ķe place to ķe whiche ķe stoon schal be krowe. 
A n d gif it krowek to hie, 
it schal be sette forķere oķer 
a more heuy stoon ido ķerinne 
ķat it may not arere so hie. 
And gif it krowek so lowe, 
ķe gyne it schal be sette nere oķer a more ligt stoon ido ķerinne. 
And alwey ķe stones schal be weye ķat schal be krowe 
to eny mark 
with suche gynes. 
Anoķer manere gyne haķ contrepayse faste 
withoute changynge to ķe swengel oķer to ķe gerd of ķe gyne, 
turnynge aboute suche a gerd. 
A n d ķe werriours of Rome 
clepede such a gyne bypha. 
A n d ķis gyne is oķer ķan ķe gyne ķat hatte trabicium, 
for ķe countrepeyse is fast to ķe gerde of ķe gyne. 
Peig it drawe ķe more 
by cause of meuynge, 
but it drawek not so ileche, 
ķerfore it krowek forķere 
and more 
but not so euene, 
so certeynliche. 
Pe ķridde manere gyne hatte tripantum 
and haķ eyÞer countrepayse fast to ķe gerd 
and ķe oon Jmeuable turnyng ķere aboute. 
A n d by cause ķat ķe contrepeyse is fast, 
ķis manere gyne krowek more euene 
ķan ķe gyne ķat hatte bypha. 
A n d by cauļse of ķe peyse ķat moueķ coi. 
and turneķ aboute, 
it krowek forķere ķan ķe gyne ķat hatte trabicium. 
Pe ferķe manere gyne [a] 
in stede of contrepeyse ropes 
ķat ben idrawe 
by strengķe of hondes of men. 
A n suche a gyne krowek not so grete stones 
as ķe forseide ķre manere gynes, 
naķeles to raye stones for ķe gyne nedeķ not so greet tyme 
as it 
nedeķ to ķe forseyde gynes, 
so ķat ķis gyne krowek sonnere and öftere 
and more spedyliche 
ķan ķe forsayde gynes. 
Panne he ķat w o l bysege a castel oķer a cite, 
gif he w o l assaille and wynne ķe strengķe by gynes ķat krowen stones, 
he schal besiliche taÞe hede wheÞer he may better wynne ķe strengķe krowyng euene oķer fer, 
oķer in mené manere 
bytwene tweyne oķer, 
also wheÞer he may more greue hem 
ķat ben byseged krowyng ofte oķer seide. 
For as hym semeķ ķat it is spedful 
with al ķes manere gynes 
and in aile ķe forseyde manere wise, 
stones may be krowe. 
And som tyme wikoute eny of ķe forseyde gynnes castels 
oķer citee ķat is byseged 
may be assaylled and iwonne. 
A n d gif ķe forseide gynnes of ķe whiche we made mencioun ben iknowe at folle, 
it schal be knowe at ķe ful hou by gynnes ķat krowen stones 
eche strengķe may be assailed and iwonne. 
For eche manere gynne ķat krowek stones 
is oon of ķe forseide gynes oķer may ben imaad 
by som liknesse of somme ķerof. 
Also it is to wetynge 
ķat boķe by day and nyte by gynes ķat krowen stones 
strengķes ķat ben byseged 
mowe be assailled and itaÞe. 
Nathales for to see how gynes smyten

alwey fuyre |

Tofore were itouched ķre maners of assayllynge and takynge of strengķes ķat ben byseged. 
O o n ķerof is by mynes

ķe oķer, 
by gynes ķat krowen stones; 
and ķe ķridde by buldyng ischift to ķe walles of 
ķe strengķe ķat is byseged. 
Panne for it is ispoÞe of asaylyng

and by gynes ķat krowen stones, 
it is to spekyng of assaylyng

A n d suche buldynges mowe be reducte to foure manere buldynges

Pe buldyng ķat hatte aries,

And ķat beem is ibounde wik roopes oķer with chaynes

and wikdrawek hym

And suche buldyng is good to assaille a strengķe ķey men 
mowe not come

For suche a beem wik an iren heed

Pe oķer buldyng to assaille and taÞe strengķes 
ķat ben byseged is icleped vinea; 
and som men clepeķ it cautum, 
and is imaad in ķis wise. 
Grete plancÞes 
and stronge ben stronliche ibounde

Also it is iheeled wik rawe hides

A n d me vseķ to maÞe suche buldynge

A n d suche a buldyng so moche oķer more mot be wel istrengķed

and ischeft to ķe walles 
of ķe strengķe 
Þat is byseged; 
and men ķat ben ķer vnder scholde delue 
and vndermyne ķe walles. 
A n d ķis buldyng is good whanne ķe strengķe [ķat] is byseged stondeķ 
so ķat suche a buldynge 
may be schift to ķe walles. 
Pe ķridde manere buldyng 
is icleped tour and castel. 
For | gif ķe f. strenķe ķat is byseged 
may not be taÞe 
by weÞeres noķer by buldyng ķat hatte vinea, 
ķe mesure of ķe walles of ķat strengķe schal be taÞe and toures 
oķer castels of tree schal be maad by ķat mesure oķer heygere, 
ķe whiche toures schal be heeled 
wik rawe huydes 
lest ķei be sette afuyre. 
A n d wik suche toures of tree strengķes 
ķat ben byseged ben assailled in twey manere wise. 
First, krowyng stones. 
For gif ķe heygÞe 
of suche castels and toures passen heighķe of ķe walles 
and of ķe toures and bataillynge ķerof, Þei Þat ben in suche castels and toures ben aboue hem ķat ben in ķe strengķe 
as ķei ķat ben in ķe strengķe 
ben aboue hem ķat ben in Þe grounde. 
Also in suche castels and toures ben fallyng brygges 
on ķe whiche brygges men goķ to ķe walles 
of ķe strengķe 
ķat is byseged. 
A n d ķe heiķe of walles 
may be taÞe in twey maner wise. First, 
by schadwe. 
For a ligt ķrede scholde be 
certey[n]liche imete and iknyt to an arwe 
and ischote to ķe walles of ķe strengķe; 
and by ķe % quantité [ķer]of, ķe quantité of ķe schadwe schal be taÞe. 
A n d whan ķe quantité of ķe schadwe schal be taÞe, 
a tree schal be rered 
vp rigt ķat maÞeķ 
so moche schadwe; 
by ķe lenķe of ķat tree 
ķe heyghÞe of ķe walles is iknowe. 
Natheles for ķe sonne schineķ not w e l alwey noķer maÞeķ alwey schadwe 
but is som tyme iheled with cloudes, 
we schal teche oķer maner of takynge of heigķe of alle buldynges 
and of alle walles. 
TaÞe a tree oķer a boord of ķe lengķe 
of a certeyn man 
and ķat man schal ligge adoun in ķe grounde. 
And ķe forseide | bord schal be sette col. 
at his feet 
and he schal loÞe ouer ķe bord. 
And gif his sigt passeķ more heig ķan ķe wal of ķe whiche ķe heigthe schal be taÞe, 
ķan ķe man schal ligge neer 
to ķe wal 
and ķe boord at his feet. 
A n d gif his sigt passeķ more lowe wik ķe borde at his feet, 
ķanne he ķat lith so 
in ķe grounde schal lye ferķere 
fro ķe wal wik ķe boord at his feet. 
A n d so he schal lye ferķer oķer neer forto he may see euene ķe toppe of ķe wal ouer ķe borde. 
For as it may be preued by gemetrie 
as moche 
as is ķe space to ķe walle 
fro ķe heed of ķat man 
ķat lyek in ķat wise, 
so moche is ķe heigķe of ķe wal. 
Also mesure of heygÞe 
may be taÞe 
by rewles ķat ben itaugt 
in astrolabye 
and in quadrante. 
But ķerof charge we not, 
but a<t> ķis tyme 
it is inow to speÞe 
of suche kynges 
as moche as suffiseķ to ķe purpos. 
r Pe ferķe manere buldyng 
is icleped musculus. A n d musculus 
is a litel buldyng 
vnder ķe whiche men ben iheled ķat drawen 
oķer scheuen casteles and toures to ķe strengķe ķat is byseged. 
Whanne it is imaad, 
ķe strengķe may be assaylled 
in ķre manere wise. 
For in a castel so imaad ben ķre partees. 
Pe ouemeste partie passeķ ķe walles and toures of ķe strengķe ķat schal be taÞe; 
in ķe myddel partie haķ brigges 
and letteķ hem falle on ķe walle; 
and ķe neķemeste partye ordeynek gynes ķat ben icleped musculy 
vnder ķe wyche musculus 
ben men ķat drawen 
and scheueķ ķe castel. And whanne ķat castel 
is as ny as it 
nedeķ to ķe walles 
of ķe strengķe ķat is bysyged, 
Þey ķat ben in ķe ouemeste partie schal krowe stones | 
and dryue hem 
awey ķat ben on ķe walles. 
And ķei ķat ben in ķe myddel partye schal lete falle brugges 
and assaile ķe walles. 
But ķei ķat ben in ķe lowest partye 
and vnder ķe musculus schal if ķei mowe come to ķe walles, 
vndermyne hem so ķat ķei ķat ben 
of ķe sege mowe 
also in ķat wise come 
in to ķe 
streng[ķ]e ķat is byseged. Also ķer scholde be arblasters, bowes, gynes to krowe stones, 
and oķere suche so ķat he smyte ķe strenķe 
whan ķe forseide doynge schal ben do. 
For in ķe moo manere wise 
a strengķe is asayled at ones, 
ķe more ķei ķat ben byseged ben afrayed 
and ķe sonnere itaÞe. f. i Chapter XX 
After ķat we hauen ispoÞen of bataille of feld and treteķ of bataille of sege teching hem 
ķat bysegen strengķes and castels 
how ķei scholde bysege and assaille hem, 
in ķis partie we w o l trete of bataille of defence; 
so ķat after ķat we hauen itaugt hem ķat bysegen 
how ķei scholde assaille hem ķat ben byseged, 
we wolle teche hem ķat ben byseged 
how ķei scholde defende hemself of hem ķat bysegen. 
And ķe first ķat most maÞeķ ķat a cite ķat is byseged 
may be defend­ ed fro enemyes 
ķat bysegen and maÞeķ most ķat ķei ķat ben bysegede 
mowe wel defende here strengķe, 
it is knowynge how castels and citées and strengķes 
and oķere suche schulde be bulde ķat ķei be not esy to assaylle. 
A n d in suche buldynge 
fyue mote be knowe by ķe whiche strenķes ben ķe more stronge 
and worse for to be taÞe. 
A n d first strengķes ben istrengķed 
and ben ķe worse for to taÞe 
by kynde of place, 
ķe seconde ļ by cornerd walles, 
ķe ķridde by erķed walles, 
ķe coi. ferķe by toures and pynacles, 
ķe fifte by diches. 
By kynde of place citées and strengķes 
by ķe more strong 
if ķei ben ibuld in strait place oķer in hie ķat ben euel to come to, 
as if ķei ben iclepped aboute wik ķe see, 
wik mareys, 
oķer wik reuers. 
And at bygynnyng whanne strengķe scholde be buld to be defended 
fro out ward fityng and fro seges, 
ķe kynde of ķe place scholde be knowe so 
ķat he be buld in suche a place 
ķat he be ķe more strong for ķat place. 
v Book III PartIII 
Oķer if me may not a while 
to bulde newe strengķes, 
oķer som dredyng wrathe of lordes 
oķer lordes dredyng woodnesse of ķe puple 
w o l be defended in som strengķe, 
gif ķei mow come ķerto, 
ķei scholde haue suche a strengķe ķat is by kynde of ķe place ķe more strong and ķe hardere to taÞe. 
Pe seconde, citées and strengķes 
ben ķe hardere to assaille by cornered walles. 
For if ķe walles 
of a strengķe be cornerede, 
gif ķe enemyes comen to ķe walles 
for to assaille ķe strengķe, 
ķei ķat ben byseged mowe 
ķe better defiende hemself 
and ķe sonnere greue ķe enemyes. 
For by cause of ķe cornered walles 
ķei mow smyte ķe ene­ myes not onliche tofore 
but also as it were byhynde 
ķei mowe smyte Þe enemyes 
Þat assayllen Þe strengķe. 
Perfore ķe walles scholde be cornered for ķe strengķe myte 
be ķe bettre defended. 
Pe ķridde ķat maÞeķ a strengķe ķe worse 
to be assayled 
and itaÞe is erķene walles. 
For in buldynge of a strengķe not | 
onlich nedeķ good f. 
w place and cornerd walles 
bote also aboute ķat strengķe scholde be maad twey walles, 
innere and vttere som dele atwynne. 
A n d in ķe space 
betwene ķe tweyn walles 
scholde erķe be do ķat is idigged 
out of ķe diche, 
oķer ķer scholde be do erķe ibrout 
out of anoķer place. 
A n d of ķat erķe me scholde maÞe morter wel itempred 
ķat it be 
as it were a wal. For toures mowe be maad of erķene mortere 
w e l itempred, 
ķer­ fore it is not inconuenient 
to maÞe suche walles 
of erķene mortere wel itempred. 
And suche wallis ben goode for defautes of ķe strengķe ķat it be not ouercome 
with gynnes ķat krow stones. 
For ķei al ķe otter wal were ibete doun 
with suche gynes, 
ut ķe erķene wal scholde fonge 
ķe stroÞes of ķe gynes. 
For whanne a stoon 
is ikrowe wik suche a gyne 
Þat comeķ to suche a wal, 
for neschenesse ķerof ķe erķe 
w o l dyue y n and fonge ķat stoon as Þei it were ischape ķerfore. 
For it is assayed 
ķat erķene walles 
ben lasse igreued with gynes 
ķat krowen stones 
ķan oķere walles, 
and suche an erķene wal scholde be kykÞe, 
for ķanne withoute apayryng 
it may fonge stoones 
ķat comen out of suche gynes. 
Pe ferķe ķat maÞen strengķe ķe more strong ben toures and pynacles. 
For on ķe walles scholde be toures and pynacles 
ķat ķe strengķe myt be ķe bettere defended. 
A n d nameliche tofore eche eat of ķe strengķe of ķe whiche is drede of brennyng 
by enemyes scholde be toures and pynacles. 
A n d tofore eche suche eat scholde be sette a cloos poortcoleys iheled w i k ire al aboute and hongynlge 
by y rene col. rynges to lette ķe comyng inne of ķe enemyes and brennyng of fuyre. 
For ķei men ķat bysegen wolde sette ķe eate of ķe strengķe afuyre, 
ķe poitecoles ķat is tofore ķe eat scholde lette hem. 
Also aboue ķe portecoleys scholde [be] a clif oķer an open place 
in ķe wal to ward ķe pourtcoleys, 
by ķe whiche place men mow krowe out stoones and water to quenche fuyre gif men ķat bysegen fonden to sette ķe eate afuyre. 
Pe fifte ķat maÞeķ strengķes 
ķe more strong 
and ķe worse to come to is depnesse and drede of diches 
ķat scholde be ful of water gif it may be. 
In ķes manere wise strengķes ben ķe worse to come to and to be taÞe. 
Perfore ķei ķat wolle defende strengķes 
f[ro] hem ķat bysegen hem scholde taÞe hede 
at bygynnynge ķat Þey haue 
in ķe strengķe alle ķes oķere manye ķerof 
for to defende ķe strengķe ķe bettere. Chapter XXI 
It is not inow to knowe how strengķes schulde be buld 
and what walles ķei scholde haue 
and in what place ķei scholde stonde 
[but it be iknowe] 
% how ķei scholde be maad stronge so 
ķat he be not sone itaÞe. 
[It is iseide tofore ķer ben ķre weies ķat strengķes ben itaÞe: 
by hunger, ķurst and figtynge. 
Panne gif in ķese weies strengķes ķat ben byseged be maad stronge, 
Þerby mowe noon strengķes be itaÞe.] 
And for ķei scholde not be itaÞe by hunger, 
ķre mote ben iknowe. 
Whete, otes and barlich, 
and oķer corn, 
and aile oķere manere vetaylles scholde be ibrougt in to ķe strengķe 
ar it be byseged wik enemyes. 
And if ķer is drede of a sege tofore gaderyng of fruyt, 
suche corn and vitailles 
scholde be brougt in to ķe strengķe out of oķere places 
ķat ben nyg leste 
Þe strengķe faille for defaute of vitailles 
whan it is byseged. 
And al ķat may | not be brougt 
to ķe strengķe, 
and al ķat is not nedful f. ķeig it were ibrougt to castel 
oķer citee ķat is byseged, 
schold al be sette afuyre 
and ibrent leste ķe enemyes come ķerto and taÞe profit ķerof and bysege ķe strengķe vpoun ķe cost of ķe same strengķe. 
A n d gif ķer is drede ķat ķe sege schal dure longe tyme, 
ķe citee oķer castel scholde be moste istored of myle. 
For among graynes myle rotyeth leest and dureķ most. 
And he scholde haue also good stoor of salt flesch; 
and also moche salt is nedful 
to a strengķe ķat is byseged, 
for salt helpeķ to manye thinges. [Pe seconde,] 
in strengkyng of castel oķer of citee ķat schal be byseged touchynge vitailles, 
it is not onliche to doynge to brynge to ķe citee ķat schal be byseged greet stoor of vitailles 
but also ķe vitailles 
ķat ben ibrougt mote be rediliche iÞepte and delyuered by wise men and redye 
ķat ben not wastours. 
öif it may be gif a greet citee is byseged 
and may not haue vitaylles 
out of oķere contrées, 
in eche contrée ķat longeķ to ķat citee vitailes 
scholde be brougt 
to ķe comyn bernes 
and be scarseliche and wiseliche ispended and deliuered by wise men and redye. 
And gif a litel strengķe is byseged, 
it is not hurt for to do so 
for greet stoor and puruyance of vitaylles 
is as it were not work but it be scarseliche and wiseliche ispend. 
Pe ķridde, 
in such doynge it nedeķ to knowe [ķat] ķe feble persones 
ķat ben not profitable noķer <mowe> helpe to defende ķe strengķe ķat v Book III PartIII is byseged, 
if it may be, 
scholde be sende i n to oķere contreis; 
for suche persones eten and wastek vetailles 
ķat figtynge men scholde haue. 
Also gif ķer is drede of defaute of vetaills, 
| beestes ķat ben in ķe col. 
strengķe ķat is byseged, 
gif ķei ķat ben byseged 
mowe wel spare hem, 
scholde be islayne and iselt gif ķei ben good to mete. 
A n d in suche a caas manye kynges ben igete ķat ben comynliche forsaÞe. 
For it is iknowe how a strengķe ķat is byseged 
scholde do to Þepe 
ķat he be not itaÞe by hunger, 
it may be sone iknowe 
how byseged men scholde do to Þepe 
ķat ķei be not itaÞe by krist. 
For ar ķei be byseged, 
Þey scholde be avised 
and go to a st[r]engķe in ķe whiche is water inow. 
A n d gif ķei ben in a strengķe in ķe whiche is no welle, 
ķei scholde maÞe pittes. 
And gif ķe place is so drye ķat ķerinne may be no water, 
puttes scholde maÞe cisternes to fonge and Þepe reyn water 
so ķat ķe water of heuene 
may socoure and helpe i n defaute of oķer water. 
A n d gif ķe strengķe ķat is byseged is nyg ķe see 
and may haue no water 
but salt water, 
for here fresch water 
is so feer ķat ķei mowe not come ķerto for men of ķe sege, 
ķanne w i k wax ķei mowe of salt water 
haue fresch water. 
For as ķe philosofer seith [in] Metheor[is], 
al ķe salt water ķat wosek krow wax bycomek fresch water. 
Also to ķe strengķe ķat schal be byseged scholde be brougt moche venegre and wyne leste 
by drynkynge of oonliche water 
figtynge men ben so feble ķat ķei mowe not mygtiliche wikstonde ķe enemyes and men of ķe sege. 
For it is itreted 
what ben ķe remedyes agenst hunger and ķurst 
by ķe whiche ofte strengķes ben itaÞe, 
it is to tretyng of remedies 
lest a strengķe ķat 
is byseged be taÞe

and by assaillynge and sautes. 
Panne ķei scholde brynge | 
to ķe castel oķer citee moche brym- f. i stoon, pyche, and oylle to brenne engynes 
and gynnes of ķe enemyes. 
Also moche yre and manye treen scholde be brogt to ķe strengķe ķat is byseged for to maÞe of ķe treen Schaftes, arwes, dartes, and buldyng ķat nedeķ to ķe strengķe. 
Also with ire ärmere 
may ben ame[n]ded and Schaftes and arwes may be maad 
and oķere kynges ķat nedeķ

ķat bysegen ķe strengķe. 
Also moche yre is nedful to hem 
ķat ben byseged for to destroye here 
gynes and buldynges ķat bysegen hem, 
as it schal be declared in ķe nexte chapitre. 
Also manye momele stones, ķat is round stones of reuerjs, 
scholde be ibrougt to ķe strengķe, 
for suche stones ben most hard and sadde 
and best to krowe and walles and towres 
scholde be ful of suche stones. 
Also moche lyme imaad to poudre scholde be ibrougt to ķe strengķe 
and manye brotei vessels 
schjolde be ful ķerof 
so 
ķat whanne men of ķe sege comeķ

And whanne ķe vessels ben ibroÞe, 
ķe lyme goķ inne to here egen and blyndek hem so ķat ķei mowe be bete as it were blynde men.

A n d gif senewes lakÞen,

nathalees in ķat wise ķat ķilÞe wey be hongynge agenste hem ķat ben in ķe myne. 
A n d ķanne in ķe metynge of ķilÞe weyes, 
of ķe whiche he ķat bysegek maÞe oon 
and he ķat [ben] 
bysegede maÞeķ ķe oķere, 
scholde be continual bataille and figtynge 
lest ķei ķat % bysege[ķ] come 
ķat wey in to ķe strengķe. 
Also ķei ķat <beķ> bysegede scholde haue 
by ķe ļ bygynnynge of coi. 
here wey vnder erķe grete vates ful of water and of pisse. 
Whan Þey figten wik hem ķat ben of ķe sege, 
Þey scholde feyne to* flee and goo out of ķe diche and scholde [schede] 
al ķe forsaide water 
and pisse ķat is so igadered vpon hem ķat ben in ķe myne. 
For in oure tyme manye men of seges were ispyld in ķat wise; 
wherfore gif it was som tyme ido, 
we scholde not holde inposcible gif it is eft ido. 
For it is iknowe how assayllynge be mynynge scholde be wikstonde, 
it is to wetynge how Þey ķat ben byseged scholde wikstonde asaylyng 
by gynnes ķat krowek stones. 
A n d agenste suche assaillyng 
is help in foure manere wyse. 
First, 
for som tyme manye men iarmed gon sodenliche out of ķe strengķe ķat is byseged and reseķ sodeynliche 
on ķe gyne and setteķ it afuyre 
ar ķe oost mowe defende it. 
But gif ķei ķat ben byseged dar not go out of ķe strengķe, 
ķanne priueyliche by nygte somme ben ilette out by ropes 
ouer ķe walles and bereķ 
wik hem fuyre preueyliche 
vnwetynge ķe enemyes 
and setteķ ķe engyne afuyre 
and ben idrawe 
vp in to ķe strengķe agen by ropes 
whan ķat is ido. 
Pe ķridde manere to destroye gynnes 
is for to 
maÞe arewes ķat som men clepeķ colos. 
A n d suche an arwe haķ 
in ķe myddel a certeyne holwenesse 
in ķe whiche is ido strong fuyre, imaad of oyle, brymstoun, pych, and roseyne, 
iwrappede in herdene. 
Worryours in olde tyme clep­ ede it incendiarium; 
and suche an arwe ischote wik a strong arblaster 
to I ķe gyne ofte setteķ it afuyre. 
f. 
Pe ferķe manere to wikstonde gynes ķat krowek stones 
is for to maÞe gynes wikinne 
Þe strengķe for to smyte hem 
and destroye hem. 
A n d among oķere Þe beste remedye 
is after ķat a gyne is imaad wik­ inne, 
to maÞe ķerto a slenge of smale chaynes of yre oķer iheled 
w i k ire. 
A n d bysydes ķe gynne maÞe a buldyng in ķe whiche a greet ire al furye hoot schal be fuyred al afuyre hoot [and] schal be sette on ķe slenge ķat is iheled 
wik ire and ikrowe to ķe oķere gyne oķer to eche manere buldynge of tree. 
And heeragenst rawe huydes helpeķ not and tymber may not wikstonde, 
and al buldyng of tre may be brent in ķis r wise. 
And ķer ben manye oķere particulers 
cautels ķat helpeķ agenst gynes ķat krowen stones. 
But for suche mow not alle be ireÞened, 
ķei mot be left 
to avisement of wise men 
and redye. 
For it is iknowe 
how me schulde withstonde mynes 
and gynes ķat krowen stones, 
it is to declarynge 
how me scholde withstonde oķere buldynges 
ķat ben ischift to ķe walles 
of a strengķe ķat is byseged. 
And herto helpeķ 
alle ķat we speÞe of touchynge 
wikstondynge of gynes. 
For as gynes ķat krowen stones 
mowe be destroyed 
by a sodeyne rees of hem 
ķat ben byseged vnwetyng ķe enemyes, 
and by men isent out of ķe strengķe preueyliche by nygte, 
and by arewes ķat bere strong fuyre, 
and by gynes ķat krowen stones, 
and by slenges iheled wik ire ķat krowen fuyre hoot ire, 
so in al ķis wise buldynge of tree | 
may be col. assayled. 
A n d it is assaied 
ķat agenste al suche buldynges 
it helpeķj most gif fuyre 
or ire is ikrowe ķeron wik oķere gynnes oķer in som oķer wise. 
Nathales agenst suche buldynges 
we may asigne certeyn remedyes, 
as agenst ķe weÞer we may asigne ķe wolf. 
For it was iseid tofore 
ķat ķe beem wik ķe heed iheled wik ire smyt­ ynge ķe walles 
of a strengķe ķat is byseged 
is icleped 
a weÞer for ķe heed is so hard. Peragen scholde be ordeyned a croÞed ire wik strong teeķ and scharpe ibounde wik ropes 
wik ķe whiche ķe heed of ķe weÞer is itaÞe oķer ķe heed of ķe beem ķat is so iheled wik ire. 
A n d whanne ķe heed 
is so itaÞe, 
oķer it is idrawe al vp in to ķe strengķe oķer it is so suspended 
ķat it may greue not ķe walles. 
A n d so olde werriours clepede ķat ire a wolf, 
for Þey taÞen so ķe weÞer wik scharpe teeķ. 
And agenst toures and castels furye ire helpeķ moche. 
Naķales ķer is a special remedye ķeragen, 
for ķer ben imaad preueyliche weyes 
vnder erķe and ķe erķe is vndermyned 
where ķe castel scholde passe. 
A n d whanne ķe erķe is so vndermyned 
and ķe castel afalle in to ķe diche ķat 
is vnder grounde and slilich iheled, 
for ķe castel is so heuy it mot be maad age, 
for it may not be brougt hool out of ķe diche. 
And agenst ķe buldynges 
ķat ben icleped vinea 
and musculus fuyre hoot ire helpeķ moche. 
Nathalees gif it happeķ ķat suche buldynges 
perischeķ ķe wal of ķe strengķe ķat is byseged, gif doute is ķerof, 
ar it be do, 
by ķe wal scholde be maad bul|dyng of tree oķer stoon wal (gif it may be) 
so ķat f. gif enemyes comeķ 
in to ķe strengķe, 
ķer he schal be holde iclosed 
bytweyne ķilÞe walles, 
not mygty to defende hemself 
for closynge of ķe walles 
and so Þey mowe be bete wik stones and aleyd. 
But it is besiliche to takyng hede ķat som tyme men 
of ķe sege feynek to fie and taÞeķ 
so ķe strengķe by fraude and by gyle. 
Perfore strengķe scholde not be [leflt necligentliche wikoute Þepynge anone after ķat enemyes agoo. 
But ķe strengķe of ķe enemyes 
scholde be besyliche icharged 
so ķat ķei gete not by fraude 
and by gyle 
ķat ķei mygte not gete wik mygt and wik strengķe. 
v Book III PartIII Chapter XXIII 
In ķis laste chapitre we w o l trete som what of bataille of schippes; 
but it nedeķ not to abyde longe ķere aboute, 
for manye kynges ķat ben iseid 
of oķere manere batailles 
mowe helpe in batailles in schippes. 
A n d touchynge ķat manere of figtynge, 
first it is to wetynge 
how a schip scholde be maad. For gif a schip is euel imaad, 
it is sone ilost 
by a litel asaillyng of enemyes. 
Panne as Vigesius seith, 
it is to wetyng ķat treen and tymber of ķe whiche a schip scholde be maad scholde not be if eld 
in eche tyme of ķe gere. 
For in March and in Auerel 
whan moche hemour is in treen, 
it is not good to feile treen 
of ķe whiche a schip scholde be maad. 
But i n Iule and in Agust oķer i n som oķer tyme 
whanne ķe humour 
in treen is fordryed, 
it is good to feile treen of ķe whiche a schip scholde be maad. 
Also a schip scholde not be made of treen anoon 
as ķei ben ifeld, 
| but first treen scholde be isawed and col. 
imaad bordes ķerof and abyde 
a certeyne tyme ķat ķei mowe drye and clynge. 
For gif a schip is imaad of grene tymber, 
whanne ķe kynde humour passeķ and failleķ, 
ķe tymber schrynÞek and maÞeķ 
i n ķe schip chynes and cliftes 
and no kyng [mowe be] more perilous ķan ķat. 
A n d it is hard to taÞe hede 
at ones to batailles of schippes and to putte hemself to peril 
lest ķe schippe be broÞe oķer sonk. 
For it is iknowe how schip tymber schulde be feld 
and be let abyde for to dryge and clynge for to 
maÞe wel a schip ķerof, 
it is to wetynge 
how i n a schip so imaad a bataille scholde be geue. 
A n d touchynge som doynge a bataille of schippes haķ som manere doynge liehe to manere doynge of bataille of ķe feld. 
For as i n bataille of ķe feld 
it nedeķ ķat figtynge men be wel iarmed 
and cunne wel defende hemself fro stroÞes and geuen enemyes 
sore stroÞes and woundes, 
and so ķis nedeķ 
i n bataille of ķe see. 
A n d also in suche figtynge it 
nedede ķat men be betere iarmed 
Þan i n figtynge in londe. 
Panne for men ķat figten in ķe see stondeķ 
as it were ipigt and meuen 
but a lite ķe[i] mowe ķe better bere heuy armer, 
wherfore here ärmere scholde be ķe more heuy. 
But as it longeķ to ķis doynge, 
we may reÞene ten by ķe whiche see figtynge men 
scholde assaylle here enemyes. 
Pe firste is fuyre ķat is icleped incendiarius. 
For it scholde haue wik hem manye vesselles 
ful of pich, 
of brymston, of roseyn, of oyle; 
and aile ķes scholde be wrapped wik herdene. 
A n d ķese vesselles | so ful f. 
i scholde be isette afuyre 
and ikrowe 
in to ķe schippe of enemyes. 
A n d ķe vessel breÞe 
and sette afuyre ķe mater 
of ķe brennynge 
and setteķ ķe schip afuyre. 
A n d manye suche scholde be krowe 
in to ķe schip 
for to sette ķe schip afuyre in manye places. 
A n d whanne suche thingges ben ikrowe, it is to doynge for to figte harde and sore wik ķe schip men so ķat ķei mowe not a while quenche ķe fuyre. 
r Pe seconde, 
buschements helpeķ moche in batailles of ķe see. 
For as in ķe lond ben isette boschementes of knygtes 
ķat fallen and resen on enemyes 
vnwaar and affrayen hem 
and ouercomen hem sone, 
so in ķe see byhynde 
som ilondes ben imaad boschementes 
so ķat ķe figtynge men 
breÞen out and fallen on enemyes 
vnwaar and ouercome hem ķe sonnere. 
Pe ķridde, 
in bataille of ķe see 
it is to doynge ķat Þey ķat sayllen haue alwey here schip in deep water and dryue ķe schip of enemyes 
to ķe clyfward; 
for Þey ķat ben idrawe 
to lond lesen ķe rees of asayllynge. 
Pe ferķe, 
to ķe mast of ķe schip scholde be honged a long tree iheled wik ire in eyÞer ende for to smyte bothe schip and schip men, 
as ķe instrument ķat hatte ķe wether smytek ķe walles of a cyte 
ķat is byseged. 
A n d ķat tre scholde be ordeyned in ķis wise so 
ķat ķe bond ķat holdeķ 
it may be meued 
vpward and dounward, 
and so is ķe more avantage 
for to smyte ķenviķ boķe ķe schippe 
and men ķat ben ķerinne. 
Pe fifte, 
in bataille of schippes scholde be many brood arwes 
for to Þerue ķe sailles of enemyes and maÞe | 
ķerinne many greet holes and col slettes. 
For whanne in ķe sailles 
ben many holes and slittes 
and mowe not holde wynd, 
ķan ķe enemyes mowe not holde ful cours 
for to smyte noķer mow s[o]ne flee gif Þey wol wikdrawe out of ķe bataille. 
Pe sixte, 
schip men vse to haue a croÞed ire 
as it were 
an hook ful scharp and Þeruyng and Þerueķ ķenviķ anoon ropes ķat holdeķ ķe sailles. 
A n d whan ķe sayles 
ben so iÞet 
and ķe maste ben ifalle, 
me wikdrawen fro ķe enemyes so 
ķat ķei mowe not figte. 
For by suche kyttynge of saylles 
and of ropes ķe schip is ķe more slow 
and ķe lasse mygty to figte. 
Pe seuenķe, 
schip men vsen to haue strong 
yren croÞes ķat ķei mowe, 
whanne Þey ben among enemyes, 
wik ķilÞe croÞes taÞe here schippes ķat ķei mowe not passe 
awey ķeig ķei wolde. 
Pe eigte, 
in bataille of schippes ķis cautel scholde be knowe, 
Þat Þei scholde haue manye vessels 
ful of whigt lyme oķer of chalk 
ķat schold be krowe 
fro hiyg place 
in to schippes of enemyes. 
A n d whanne ķei ben stronglich ikrowe and ibroÞe, 
pouder ariseķ, 
as we seide tofore 
in bataille in londe, 
and comeķ in to ķe eygen of enemyes 
and greueķ hem so ķat ķei ben 
as it were iblynded 
and mowe not see. 
A n d ķat is ful perelous in bataille of schippes, 
for in suche a bataille figtyng men ben in peril of deeķ in eche side. 
Wherfore gif eyen of figtynge men in suche a bataille 
ben so igreued wik poudre of lyme oķer of chalÞe so ķat ķei mowe not isee, 
ķei mowe ligtliche be spilde of here enemyes 
oķer adreynt in ķe see. 
Pe nynÞe cautel 
is to haue manye vessels 
ful of nesche soope ķat | f. i scholde be strongliche ikrowe 
in to ķe schippes of enemyes, 
and ķat on ķe place 
in Þe whiche ķe enemyes stonden inne to defende ķe v Book III PartIII schippes. 
For whanne ķilÞe vessels 
ben ibroÞe, 
ķilÞe places ben imaad so slidere by nesche sope 
ķat whanne enemyes setten here feet ķerinne anon Þey fallen in to ķe see. 
Pe tenķe is as it were worst of alle. 
For som schip men mowe dure longe vnder water, 
ķanne schip men scholde ordeyne 
som what agenst ķe schip of enemyes 
and sende oon byhynde pryueiliche ķat may longe abyde vnder water 
and maÞe hooles 
wik a gymelot oķer 
with an augeer 
in ķe schip of enemyes 
in ķe neķer side, 
and maÞe manye hooles 
ķerinne ķat ķe enemyes may not fynde. 
A n d whanne moche water comeķ 
in at ķilÞe hooles, 
ķe enemyes ben ilost and ķe schip also. 
Also it is to wetyng ķat in a bataille of schippes 
scholde be manye stoones 
and manye scharpe ires ķat may be krowe rit as stones 
wik ķe whiche enemyes 
ben soone igreued. 
But ķer ben so manye suche particuler doynges 
ķat ķei mowe not alle be ireÞened. 
Panne ben ķer cautels 
inowe ķat we hauen itaut touchinge batailles of schippes. 
For it is declared how treen and tymber scholde be feld 
of ķe whiche schippes scholde be maad 
and how me scholde fite in batailles of schippes, 
it is to doynge ķat we declare wherto aile batailles ben iordeyned. 
Panne it is to wetyng, 
as ķe philosofer meneķ, 
ķat [we] werryeth 
not for to haue werre 
but for to haue pees. 
A n d bataille and werre may be ordeyned of malice of men, 
and by coueityse for | to col. haue wynnynge, 
oķer wreche for wrathe, 
oķer som likynge. 
But netful batailles ben iordeyned 
for pees and quyete of men 
and for ķe comune profit, 
for batailles scholde be among men 
as drenches and blood letynge 
in ķe bodye of mankynde. 
For in ķe bodye of man ben manye humours, 
so among men ben manye persones and manye men. 
A n d as while ķe humours 
ben accordynge in ķe bodye vs nedeķ noķer drenche 
ne bledyng while ķer is no passyng of humours, 
so while men beren hem wel and non doķ oķer wrong scholde no werre be noķer bataille. 
Wherfore as by bledynge 
and by drenches 
superfluyte of humours 
is ikrowe out ķe whiche superfluyte 
letteķ heele of ķe body, 
so by batailles enemyes scholde be bore adoon and isleyne 
ķat leiten ķe comune profit and pees of citeseynes 
and of hem ķat ben in ķe regne. Panne gif kynges and princes hauen ritful werre and bataille 
and if here enemyes 
disturblen wrongfulliche ķe pees and ķe comyn profit, 
it is not inconuenyent to teche hem al maner fitynge of bataille 
and al maner doynge 
by ķe whiche ķei mow ouercome here enemyes. 
A n d al suche doynge ķei scholde ordeyne 
for ķe comyn profit 
and for pees of citeseyns. 
For gif ķei desiren ķe comyn profit 
and pees of ķe citeseyns, 
ķei schulle haue ķat perpetual pees 
in ķe whiche is cheef quiete and reste - 
ķe whiche pees G o d graunteķ and byhotek to his owne trewe seruantes ķat is iblessed for eueremore. Amen.
