Of alle dredful thyng, deÞ is most dredful and ende of al dredful ‡ thinges, a[s] it is iseid, iii Ethicorum. Panne where enemyes ben | aboute to slee men and liggen in awayte for to slee citeseyns nedeķ al maner cautel so ķat ķe oost be Þept hool and sond and lif of citeseyns isaued. 5 Panne it is not inow to knowe thinges ķat scholde be iknowe in figtynge in bataille but me knowe also cautels to putte of lettes of weyes and to be waar of boschementes, ķat ķe oost falle not in peril by boschementes of enemyes isette in ķe wey oķer by sides ķe wey. And as it longeķ to ķis doynge we may reÞene eigte cautels ķat ķe duk of a bataille scholde  haue in mynde for to saue ķe wey of figtynge men ķat ben vnder hym. Firste, ķei scholde haue iwrete ķe weyes of contrées by ķe whiche ķe oost schal passe, and ķe space betweyne place, and ķe manere of weyes and paķes and turnynges and wyndynges, and ķe monteyns and reuersķat ben inķe wey. And gif he mygte, [ķ]e [duk of ķe oost] scholde  haue ķe paas (mounteyns) and reuers (tornynges and wendynges) discreued and ipeynt in parchement oķer in a clooķ, ķat he mygte as it were isee wiÞhis eyge how Þe oste scholde passe and how he mygte beste lede his oost saafliche. For so doķ schip men ķat seig ķe periles of ķe see. For to saue here schippes fro schip breche ķe[i] hauen a  clooķ ķat hatte mappa maris, ķe clooķ of ķe see and lettes and periles ķerof and oķere suche thinges. And schip men loÞen ķeron and knowen anon how ķei scholde wende and in what place ķei ben and where of ķei mote be waar. Panne for boschementg of enemyes an oost is in as manye perils oķer in mo perils in Þe wey ķan schip men in ķe see, in  no wise an oost scholde passe by a wey in Þe ļ whiche may be perel but ķe duÞe of Þe oost haue discreued and ipeynt ķe manere of weyes, mounteyns, and reueres, and oķere thinges ķat ben in Þe wey. Pe seconde cautel is ķat Þerwik ķat he haķ weyes and manere weyes discreued and ipeynt, [ķ]e duk of bataylle scholde haue guydes ķat  knowen wel Þe weyes and hauen ofte ipassed Þerby. For sigt of thinges ķat ben discreued and ipeynt maÞen not thinges so wel iknowe as ķei ben iknowe by hemself gif we seen hem in dede, for kynges ben iknowe bettere by hemself gif ķei ben iseye in dede ķanne by peynture and liknesse ķerof. Neķķelees leste ķe gydes caste fraude and gyle, ķe duÞe  schal sette aboute hym good Þepynge and warde ķat he mowe not scape and flee. Also he schal manase to slee hem gif ķei don eny gyle and byhoote hem good giftes gif ķei doun wel and treweliche. Pe ķridde, ķei scholde haue wik hem manye wis men and trewe to ķe prince and ivsed to bataille, and do by here counsaille al ķat is to  doynge. For in so greet perel no man scholde triste to his owne witte noķer in hemself alone. The Governance of Kings and Princes Pe ferķe cautel is Þat Þe weyes scholde be vnknowe by Þe whiche Þe oost scholde passe. For ķe more preueye ķe duÞes counsaile is, Þe lasse ķerof ķe ordinaunce is ilette and comeķ ķe bettre and Þe sonere to good ende. And whanne it is iordeyned in what weyes Þe oost 5 scholde passe and Þe duÞe haķ thulÞe weyes discreued and ipeynt and haķ goode gydes and trewe, Þe more preueye ķat is, andÞe lasse iknowe to ķe enemyes, Þe | more siÞereliche Þe oost may passe Pe fifte [i]s to haue in eche ward and in eche schiltrom trewe hors men and strong and orpede ķat hauen swift hors and stronge ķat  scholde priÞe forkward and bakward, li[ft]som and rigtsom, and in eche side a discouere[n] Þe contrey and buschementes leste som enemy ligge in awayte to aspye in what side Þei mygte greue Þe oost. For Þei no men knewe Þe duÞes counsaile, gut for ķe oost begynnek to passe by som weyes, som man may gesse by what weyes ķei scholde passe.  And for it is to trowynge ķat alwey in suche doynge ben spies, ķe duÞe of ķe bataille scholde thenÞe ķat it mygt also be knowe to ķe enemyes. Also for ķe forseide perels scholde greue ķe lasse, ķe contrey and buschements scholde be discouered by most swift hors men leste ķe oost my3te be greued vnwaar in eny side.  [Pe sixte, ķat] % alwey in ķat side in ķe whiche is most drede of perel scholde be ordeyned best kny3tes and best fi3tyng foot men. And gif drede is of perel in eche side, [in eche side] scholde remedie be ordeyned. Pe seuenķe, ķat ķe oost goo not out of ordre. For gif ķe schiltrom is  disarayed, it is ķe sonnere ouercome. And alwey an oost scholde goo in suche aray so ķat gif ķe enemyes were present, ķei my3te not greue ķe oost. Perfore it is iseid in a prouerbe, Qui est munitus non est derisus: he ķat is iwarned and istrengķed is not iscorned. Panne alwey ķe duÞe of bataille ķat haķ Þe charge of Þe lif of so manye men scholde be besi liehe iwaar ķat enemyes falle | not as it were on oon Þat is negligent and slepynge. Also ķe duÞe of an oost, centuriones and decani, and oķere leders in dedes of bataille, scholde alwey menge and charge kny3tes and foot men to be alwey redy to fi3te so ķat gif ķer happeķ eny rees, Þat Þei mowe sodeynliche.withstondehem ķat .reseķ. And gif  ķei doun so, ķei ķer falle a sodeyn rees oķer asaugt, ķe ost is alwey as it were avised and enemyes scholde greue Þe lasse. Pe eigte cautel is to taÞe heede wheÞer in Þe ost be mo foot men oķer hors men, for hors men defendeķ hymself best in feldes and foot men in wodes and in mounteyns. And so as Þe duk of Þe batayle knowek  Þat he haķ manye hors men oÞer foot men, he may chese large weyges by feldes oÞer by wodes and monteyns and oķer as he knowek Þat it is to doynge.
