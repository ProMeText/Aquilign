After þat by help of God we hauen iended pe furste partie of þis firste book in the whiche it is itreted of mannis owne gouernaunce, schewynge wherinne kynges and princes schullen sette here felicite. For it is not semelich for hem to sette here ende in riches noþer in cyuil myst and strengþe, noþer in no suche thinges; but he schal vse al suche thinges, as it is proued tofore atte folle, as instrumentis and inuenciones for to come to felicitée. Þei schullen sette here felicite in dede of prudencia, as pat dede cometh of charité. For þanne kynges hauen felicite accordyng to here astate, whanne by excityng of deleccioun of God, þey rulen hem pat bien vnder hem holilyche and rightfulliche by prudencia of regnynge and by lawe of resoun. þanne pe felicite of  kynges schal be principalliche iset in God. And by knowyng and loue of hym he schal ordeyne here studie and here lif þerto, þat pei mowe knowe and loue God and rule pe poeple pat is vnder ham as verrey Goddes seruauntes by ordre of resoun. þanne, for pis is treted, and it is schewed where inne kynges schal  sette here ende and felicite by pe ordre pat is isette, now it is to schewyng in what vertues kynges schal be excellent and vertuous by certeyn heygtyng and perfeccioun of pe soule. þerfore it nedeth firste to schewe whiche bien pe vertual poten|cie and mytes of pe soule and in col.  whiche mystes pe vertues bien igrounded and ipit. And þanne it schal  be ischewed how pe vertues bien distingued. þerafter we schal declare how many suche vertues per bien and whiche þerof is principale, and whiche is secundary, andþeannewe schal trete singulerlich of eueriche of pese vertues and how it semeth kynges and princes to haue suche vertues.  þe vertual mygtes of pe soule mowe be destyngued in pese wise: for som bien kynde and natural, and some cognitif and sensitif, and some appetitif, and some intellectual. In natural myites of pe soule we communeth with herbes and treen, as in vertual myst of norsching, of wexinge, and of gendrynge, and in suche as corden to herbes and treen.  þe mystes of sensitif knowyng and felyng be pe sit, tast, and touche, and pe oþer wittes, and þerinne we accordeþ wiþ oþser bestes. þe appetitif is destyngued, for oon appétit is in man and not in oper bestes as pe appétit pat foloweth pe intellectual inwit. And anofcer maner appétit is in man and in beste, as pe appetite pat folweth pe felyng, and suche  appetite may be cleped sensualitas. And pe appétit þat folweth pe intellectual inwit is icleped voluntas, pe wille. And in pat manere of speche oper bestes hauende appetite pat hatte sensualitas and appetitus sensitiuus, and haueth not pe appetite pat hatte voluntas, þe intellectual wille.  þanne pe vertues of pe whiche we thinketh to speke bien goode habites, pat is dwellyng places; outhir thai bien in pe natural vertual mygtes, oþer in pe vertual mystes and wittes of felyng, oþer in pe appetite sensitif of felyng, oþer in pe appetite intellectual, oper in pe intellecte and inwyt, oper in al pes, oper in some þerof. And a mowe  not be in natural vertual migttes and jsat is declared in pre wise. Firste, for we bep nougt preysed noþer iblamed for naturel and kynde vertue, for no man is acounted a good man for he hath good degestioun and wexinge. þe seconde, suche vertues bep nougt in pe naturel vertual mytes, for suche vertues stonden by resoun as it may be preued, ii  Ethicorum, and natural mytes bien not obedient to resoun in þat þei bien soche. For pei a man make resouns wheþer he wil oper no, properliche for to speke pe natural potencial vertues varieth not in here kynde worchynge but wercheth alwey with al here myt. þe þridde, habites and vertues bien not in natural uertual mytes, for suche habites and  vertues inclineth potencial vertues to do wel oper euel, as a vicious habite inclyneth to do euel, and as a vertuous habite inclineth to do wel. þanne for kynde is inclyned and determined to oon, and potencial vertues bien fol inclyned by kynde to worche by here owne kynde, and so therby we bep noþer vertuous ne vicious as we speketh heere of  vertueus and of vices; and so gerinne may not be suche vertues. And by pe same pre resouns by pe whiche it is preued pat vertuees bien not in pe natural potencial vertues, it may be preued pat pei bien not in pe knowyng of pe fif wittes. For as we ben nouþt ipreysed noþer iblamed for natural potencial vertues, so we ben not ipreysed noþer  iblamed for pe fife wittes; for as no man is preysed for a gode man for he hap a gode digestion and wexyng, so man is not presed for scharp sigt and gode hiryng, but if it fallen by hap oper yf a man is ble|r col.  eyed and his sist apeired for greet etyng and drynkyng, oþer gif he hath euel digestioun or feblenesse of stomachus for etyng, aliter he  schold be blamed for ouer mych drinkyng, aliter, and nougt for he hath yuel dygestioun, noþer for feble sigt ‡ - for scharp sight and good digestioun is not in oure power propurliche for to speke - but he schulde be blamed fore he hath itake to muche of mete and of drynke, for it was in his powere to ete and drynke mesurableliche. þe secunde, moral vertue is not in pe potencial vertue of þe fyue wyttes, for as pe kynde potencial vertues beþ nog obedient to reson, for by reule of resoun no man hap more digestioun oþer lasse, noþer more growyng oþer lasse: so pe fif wittes bien not obedient to resoun,  for it is not in manis power to se oper heitlerlich oper dymlich; and gif moral vertue folweth resoun, þanne vertue is not in fife wittes. þe þridde, moral vertue is not in peFIFOwittes; for as pe natural potencial vertues bep fol set to here worchyng by here owne kynde, so bien pe wittes also. For as pe fuyre heteth wiþ al his mygt, for it worcheth by  his owne kynde and is þerfore noþer preysed noþer iblamed, noþer þerinne is moral vertue: so for pe potencial vertue of digestioun makeþ as gret digestioun as he may, and pe eyge seeth as moche as he may, gerinne may no moral vertue be iset. For by natural vertue, potencial vertue is iset awork atte folle by here owen kynde and nedeþ þerfore  no moral vertue. And so moral vertue is not in natural potencial vertue, noþer in potencial vertues of pe fife wittes; and oþer potencial vertues ben þere nougt bute the intellectualle vertu þat is pe vnderstondyng and pe appetite sensytyue and intellectiue. þanne in soche potencial vertues mot be moral vertues
