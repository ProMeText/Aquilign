And that londe 
He had y-chose bifore all other londes 
as the most vertuous 
and most worthi of the world. 
And therfore seith the philosofre thus: 
virtus rerum inmedio consistit. 
That is to say: 
"vertu of thynges is in the myddel." 
And in that londe He wolde lede His liff 
and suffre passion 
and deth of Jewes 
for to bigge us and delivereus
fro paynes of Hell and deth withouten eynde, 
which was ordeyned to us for synne 
of oure forme fader Adam 
and for oure owen synnes also. 
As for Hymselfnought, 
for He hadde noon yvel deserved, 
for He dide never yll. 
And He that waskyng of joye, 
He myght best in that place suffre deth. 
For whoso wole do eny thyng 
for the which he wole be knowe opynli, 
he wole do hit crie opynli 
in the myddelplace of a cité other of a toune, 
so that hit may be knowe 
to all parties of that cité 
other of that toune. 
So dide He that was kyng of the worlde. 
He wolde suffre dethat Jerusalem, 
that is in the middel of the worlde, 
so that hit myght be knowe to men 
of all parties of the worlde 
how dire He bought man 
that He made to His licknys
for the gret love 
that He hadde to us. 
For more worthy catel 
myght nought besette for us 
than His blessid body 
and His precious blood 
which He offred for us. 
Lo, dere God, 
what love He hadde 
to His sogettes, 
when He that hadde don notrespas, 
only for oure trespas suffred deth. 
Ryght wel ought men to love 
and dredeand worshippe soche a lord, 
and preise soch a lond so holy 
that brought forth socha fruyt, 
thorgh which every man is saved 
but hit be his owene defaute. 
This is thelond that longeth 
to oure heritage. 
And in that lond 
He wolde deyghe 
and seysed to leve hit 
to His children. 
For which every good Cristen man 
that hath wherofsholde streynth hem 
for to conquere oure ryght heritage 
and chace away the myssetrewantes. 
For we beth called Cristen men 
of Crist Oure Fader. 
And if webe right children of Crist 
we aughte then 
to chalenge the righte heritage of OureFader 
and put hit 
out of strange men hondes. 
But now pryde, covetise, and envye 
hath enflammed the herte of lordes of theworlde, 
that they bien more bisy 
forto deserte her neyghbores 
than to chalangeand conquere 
here ryght heritage biforeseyd. 
And comyn peple 
that wolde puthere body and catel 
to conquere oure heritage may nought do 
withoute lordes. 
Forasemblé of comyn peple 
withoute a chief lorde beth 
as a flock of sheep 
that hathno shephurd, 
which they parteth asoundre 
and woot nought whyder to go. 
Butwolde God that wordli lordis 
were of good acoord and eche of hem other 
and alsocomune peple 
that they wolde take this holy viage over the see. 
I trowe thenwithynne a litel 
while oure right heritage forsayde 
sholde be reconsiled 
and y-puttein handes 
of the right eyres of Jhesu Crist. 
And for as moch as men desireth 
to hyre speke of the Holy Lond 
and they havetherof greet solas, spoort, and comfort, 
I shal telle somwhat 
that I have sey. 
JohnMaundevyle knyght, 
thow Y be nought worthi, 
that was bore in Engelond 
in thetoun of Seynt Albones 
and passed the see 
in the yer of the Incarnacioun of OureLord Jhesu Crist 1332 
uppon Seynt Michelis day. 
And sithe hiderward 
have Y belong tyme 
over the see, 
and have Y seye 
and go thorgh many londes, 
and Y leyghin many provinces and kyngdomes. 
I have passed thorgh Turky and Surry, 
Hermony the Lasse and the More, Tartari, Perce, Arabie, Egipte the Heigh and the Lowe, Libie, Caldee, 
and a greet party of Ethiope, Amazayn, 
and a greet partyeof Inde the More and the Lasse, 
and thorgh many other iles that beth aboute Inde, 
wher that dwelleth many diverse folk 
of maneris and diverse lawes and shappes. 
Of which londes and iles 
Y shal speke more plenerly. 
And Y shal divise a parti of that 
Y have seye in the worlde 
as hit may come 
to my mynde herafter. 
And speciali of hem that wole and beth 
in purpos to visite the holy cité of Jerusalem, 
and theholy places that beth thereaboute, 
and weyes which 
men shul holde thider, 
for Yhave many tymes y-passid and ryden 
to Jerusalem in company 
of greet lordesand other good companye. 

In the name of God Almyghty, 
whoso wole passe 
over the see, 
he may go bymany waies 
after the contré 
that he cometh fro, 
and many of hem cometh to ooneynde. 
But troweth nought 
that Y wole telle all the tounes, citees, and castelles 
thatmen shul go by, 
for then sholde Y make a long tale, 
but sum contreis and mostprincipal stedes 
that men shul go thorgh to the ryghte way. 
Ferst, if a man come 
fro the west side of the worlde 
as Ingelonde, Walys, Skotlond,Irlond, Norway, 
he may if he wole go thorgh Almayne 
and the kyngdome of Hungré, 
that marcheth to the lond of Poyaline 
and to the lond of Panonye and Alfeigh. 
The kyng of Hungré 
is right a greet lorde 
and holdeth greet londes and fele,
for he holdeth the lond 
of Hungré, Savoyze, Comayne, 
a greet party of Bulgariethat 
men calleth the lond of Bugers, 
and a greet party of the kyngdome of Rosse,
and hit lastith to the lond of Neflond, 
and hit marcheth to Pruysse. 
And in thelond of Hungrie, 
men goon thorgh a cité 
that men calleth Chipproun 
and thorghthe castel of Newbow, 
by the same toun 
that is toward the eynde of Hungrie. 
And thenne men passeth 
by the ryver of Danubye, 
that is a greet ryver 
and hit goth toAlmayne 
under the hilles of Lombardy, 
and hit taketh into hym 40 other ryversand 
hit renneth thorgh Hungry, 
thorgh Grecis, thorgh Tarchie, 
and goth into thesee 
so swiftly that the water is fressh 20 mile in the see. 
And then men goth to Belgrave 
and entre into the lond of Bruges 
and thermen passith a brugge of stoon 
that is over the rever of Marrok. 
And so passiththorgh the lond of Pynceras 
and cometh to Grece, 
to the cité of Sternes, 
and to thecité of Affynpayn, 
and so to the cité of Bradremple, 
and thenne to Constantynople,
that was sumtyme called Bessamoran, 
and ther dwelleth comunely the emperour of Grece. 
Ther is the beste cherch 
of the worlde and fairest, 
and hit is of Seynt Sophie. 
And byfore this cherch 
is an image of Justinian the emperour 
y-gilded uppon anhors y-crouned. 
And hit was woned 
to holde an apple rounde in his hond. 
Andmen seyn ther 
that hit is a tockne 
that the emperour hath i-loste 
a greet party ofhis lond, 
for the appill is fall out of the imageis hond 
for he lost gret party of hislordship. 
For he was woned 
to be emperour
of Romayne and Grece 
and all Asie theLasse, of Syrrie, 
and of the lond of Jude, 
in the which is Jerusalem, 
and of the londof Egipt, 
of Percie, and Arabie; 
but hit was lost — 
all but Grece. 
And men manytymes wolde putte the apple 
into the imageis hond, 
but he wolde nought holde hit. 
And his other hond he holt upward 
to the west in tockne to manasse mysdowers. 
This image stondeth 
uppon a pilour of marbell. 
At Constantynople ther 
is the sponge and the reed 
of the which the Jewes gafOure Lorde to drynke 
galle uppon the Croys. 
Som men lyveth that half of theCroys of Crist 
be in Cipre in an abbey of monkes, 
that men calleth the hille of theHoly Croys; 
but hit is nought so, 
for that crosse 
that is in Cipre 
is that crosse 
thatuppon which Dismas, 
the good theef, was honged. 
But all men woot nought, 
and that is nought wel y-do, 
for they seyn for getyng of offryng that hit 
is the Croysof Our Lord Crist. 
And ye shal understonde 
that the Croys of Our Lord 
was imakydof foure maner of trees, 
and hit is conteyned in this verse: 
In cruce fit 
palma, cedrus, cipressus, oliva. 
For that pece 
that went upright fro the erthe 
into the heedwas of cipresse; 
and that pece overthwart 
into the which the hondes 
wer nayled was of palme; 
and the mortais of cedre; 
and the table above his heed 
that was a footand half long, 
uppon the which 
the title was wryten in Ebru, Greu, and Latyn, 
was of olive: 
Jhesu Nazarenus, rex Judeorum. 
And the Jewes makid this Cros 
of thesefoure maner of trees 
for they wened that Oure Lord 
sholde have honged upponthat Cros 
als longe as that Cros myght have dured. 
And therfore they maked thefoot of cedre, 
for cedre may nought rote in erthe, 
nother in water. 
And for theywente 
that the body of Crist 
sholde have stonke, 
therfore was maked a peece 
thatwent fro the erthe upward of cipres: 
for that tre is wel smellyng, 
so that the stenchof His body 
shold nought have greved men 
that passid therby. 
And that overthwartpeece 
was maked of palme, 
for in the Olde Testament 
was ordeyned that when 
anyman hadde victorye 
he was crouned with palme. 
And the table of the title 
wasmaked of olive, 
for that tree tokned pees, 
as the story of Noe witnessith hit, 
whanthe culver brought the branch of olive
 that bitokneth pees y-maad 
bytwixt God andman. 
And so trowed the Jewes 
to have pees when Crist were deed, 
for they seidethat Crist 
makid the bate among hem. 
And ye shal understonde 
that Our Lord was nayled 
to the Cros liggyng, 
andtherfore He suffred the more payn. 
As Grekes and Cristin men 
that dwelleth overthe see seyn, 
that the tre of the Cros 
that we callen cipresse 
was of the tree 
thatAdam eet of the apple, 
and so fynde they writen. 
And they sayn that her scripturetelleth 
that Adam was sike and bad 
his son Seth that he sholde go to Paradis 
andpray the angel that kepid Paradis 
that he wolde sende hym 
of the oyle of mercy 
toanoynty therwith his membris 
that he myght have heel. 
And Seth wente theder, 
butthe angel wold nought lete hym in, 
but seyde to hym 
that he myght nought havethe oyle of mercy. 
But tho he toke hym foure graynes 
of the same tre 
that Adameet of the apple 
and bad hym als so sone 
as his fader were deed, 
he sholde put thograynes 
under his tonge 
and grave hym so. 
And he dide so. 
And of these fouregraynes spronge foure trees, 
as the angel seyd, 
which sholde bere a fruyt, 
thorghwhich fruyt Adam sholde be saved. 
Of which trees was maad the Cros 
that bareGod Jhesu Crist, 
that sweet fruyt 
thorgh which Adam 
and alle that come 
of hymwere saved and deliverid 
fram eyndelys deth, 
but hit be here owen defaute. 
ThisHoly Cros hadde the Jewes i-hudde 
in the erthe 
under the roch of the mount ofCalvarie, 
and hit lay ther 200 yer and more 
into that tyme that Seynt Eline fondhit. 
The which Seynt Eline was 
moder of Constantyn, 
the emperour of Rome, 
andsheo was doughter of a kyng, 
the which was kyng of Ingelond 
that was that tymecalled 
the Greet Brytayne, 
when the emperour toke 
her to wyve for here greetfairnesse 
when he was in that contré. 
And ye shal understonde 
that the Cros ofOure Lord 
was of leyngthe of eyght cubitis, 
and that overthwart 
was of thre cubitisand an half. 
A party of the croune of Our Lord, 
wherwith He was i-crouned, 
and oon of thenailes, 
and the speer-heed, 
and many other relikes beth in Fraunce in the kyngeschapel. 
And the croune beth 
in a vessel of cristal wel y-dight and richely. 
For akyng of Fraunce 
somtyme boughte these relikis of the Jewes, 
to wham the emperourhad i-leyd 
to wedde for a greet somme of goolde and silver. 
And though hitbe 
so that men sayn that hit beth thornes, 
ye shal understond 
that His was risshesof the see 
that beth white, wecle, and priketh 
as sharply as thornes. 
For I have seymany tymes 
that croune of Parys 
and also of Constantinople, 
for they beth but ofoon 
y-maked of risshes of the see. 
But they have departed hem 
in two parties,
of which oon party is at Parys 
and that other party is at Constantynople. 
And Yhave a poynt therof, 
and that semeth whit thorn, 
and that was y-give 
to me for gretlove, 
for ther beth many broken and fallen 
in the vessel wher the croun is, 
as theybreken when men stiren the vessel 
to shewe the croune 
to greet lordes that comeththider. 
And ye shal understonde that Our Lord, 
that nyght that He was take, 
He waslad into a gardeyn 
and there He was examined sharply. 
And ther the Jewesskorned Hym 
and makyd hym a croune of the branche of the albespine 
thatgrowed in the same gardeyn 
and sette hit uppon His heed 
so faste that the bloodran adoun 
by many places of His visage, 
and His necke, 
and His shuldres. 
Andtherfor hath the albespyne many vertues. 
For he that berith a branch uppon hym,
ne shal no thundre 
ne no tempest in no maner hym deer. 
Ne in the hous 
that hitis ynne 
may noon yvel spirit com, 
ne in place 
wheer hit is. 
And in the same gardeyn
Seynt Petir deneyd Oure Lord God thries. 
And afterward Oure Lord was y-lad 
byfore the bysshopis of the lawe 
in anothergardeyn of Anne, 
and ther He was examined 
and also y-skorned and y-crounedwith 
a whit thorn 
that men callen barbarines 
that groweden in the same gardeyn,
and that hath als many vertues. 
And then was He y-lad 
into the gardeyn of Cayphas,
and ther He was y-crouned with englenter. 
And then He was y-lad into thechambre of Pilat, 
and ther He was examined and also y-crouned. 
And tho theJewes sette Hym 
on a chayre and clothid Hym 
in a mantel, 
and they makydthe croune 
of rysshes of the see 
and knelid to Hym 
and skorned Hym 
and sayde: 
Ave, rex Judeorum. 
That is to say: 
"Hayl, kyng of Jewes." 
And of this croune 
is oon halfendeel at Parys 
and that other deel at Constantinople. 
And this croune He haddeuppon His heed 
when He was doon on the Cros, 
and therfore hit is most worthi. 
And the sper shaft hath the emperour of Almayne, 
but the heed is at Paris. 
Also atConstantynnople 
lyth Seynt Anne Our Lady Moder, 
for Seynt Eline brought hurether fro Jerusalem. 
And ther lith also the body of John Crisostom, 
that was bysshopof Constantinople. 
And ther lith Seynt Luke the Evangelist, 
for his bonys werebrought 
fro Bethany wher he was grave. 
And many other relikes beth ther. 
Andther is the vestel of ston as hit were marble, 
which men callen ydrions, 
that evermore droppeth water 
and fillith hymself ech yer. 
And ye shal understond 
that Constantinople is right a fair cité and a good, 
andryght wel y-walled, 
and hit is thre cornerid. 
And ther an arme of the see that mencallen Hellesponte, 
and som callen hit Bouch of Constantynople, 
and som callenhit Brace de Seynt Gorge. 
And this water closeth two parties 
of the cité. 
Andupwarde to the see 
uppon the water was y-woned 
to be the greet cité 
of Troyein a ful fair playn, 
but that cité was destroyed 
with men of Grece. 
And ther beth manyiles 
that men callen thus: 
Calastre, Calcas, Cetige, Tesbiria, Arynona, Faxton,Molo, Carpate, and Lempne. 
And in this ile is the Mount Athos that passeth thecloudes. 
And ther beth many spechis 
and many contreis 
the which beth obesshantto the emperour, 
that is to saye 
Turcople, Pynornard, Coma, Comange, Trachise,and Macidone, 
of which Alisaundre was kynge, 
and many other. 
In this contré was Aristotle y-bore 
and in a cité 
that men callen Strages, 
a litlefro the cité of Trachye. 
And at Strages was Aristotle y-grave, 
and ther is an auteruppon his tumbe. 
And ther they make 
a greet feste every yer als though he werea seynt. 
And uppon his auter they holden greet conseylis. 
And they troweth thatthorgh inspiracioun 
of God and of hym 
they shal have the better consail. 
In thatcontré beth right hyghe hilles, 
and toward the eynde of Macedone 
is a greet hillethat men callen Olimpus, 
that departith Macedone and Trachie 
and is high up tothe cloudes. 
And that other hille 
that men calleth Aches 
is so high that the shadeof hym 
recheth to Olimpus 
that is neygh 77 myle bytwyne. 
And above that hille isthe eyr 
so cleir that men may feile no wynd ther. 
And therfore may no beest lyvether, 
for the eyr is so drigh. 
And men seyn in that 
contré that philosopheris 
somtyme wente uppon thilke 
hill and helde to here nose a sponge i-moisted 
with waterto have the eyr. 
And above, in the poudre of the hill, 
they writen letteris with herefyngres, 
and at the yeris eynde they come ageyn 
and fyndeth the same lettres 
withoute eny faute. 
And at Constantynople the emperouris paleis 
is right fair and wely-dight. 
And therin is a fair paleis for justyng, 
and hit is uppon stages, 
that allemen may see the justes, 
and under thilke stages beth stables 
vauted for the emperouris hors, 
and alle the pilouris beth of marbel. 
And withinne the cherche of Seynt Sophie 
a emperour wolde have i-graven hisfader 
when he was deed. 
And they makid the grave and fond a body 
in the erthe,
and theruppon lay a greet plate of fyn goold. 
And theruppon was i-writen 
in Ebru,Gru, and Latyn thus: 
Jhesu Cristus nascetur 
de Virgine Maria 
et ego credo in eum. 
Thatis to say: 
"Jhesu Crist shal be bore 
of the Virgyn Mari 
and I belyve on Hym." 
Andthe date of this, 
when hit was leyd in the erthe, 
was 2000 yer byfore that Our Lordwas y-bore. 
And yit is that plate in the tresorie 
of that cherche. 
And men seyn thathit was the body 
of Hermogenes the wise man. 
And though hit be so 
that men ofGrece beth Cristyn, 
yit they varieth fro youre feith. 
For they sey that the HolyGoost 
com nought of the Sone 
but fro the Fader, 
and they beth nought 
obesshentto the Cherche of Rome, 
nother to the pope. 
And they seyn that her patriarch 
hathals moche power over the see 
as the pope on this side. 
And therfore the Pope Johnthe Twelfthe sende lettres 
to hem how Cristin feyth 
shold be all oon. 
And that theisholde be obesshant 
to the Cherch of Rome 
and to the pope, 
that is Cristis vicaron erthe, 
to wham God gaf playn power 
for to bynde and to assoyle, 
and therforthey sholde be obedient to hym. 
And they sent agen to hym, 
the pope, divers letters and anaswers, 
and among other thyng 
they seyde thus: 
Potenciam tuam summamcirca tuos subdiectos 
firmiter credimus. 
Superbiam tuam summam tollerare 
non possumus. 
Avariciam tuam summam saciare 
non intendimus. 
Dominus tecum sit. 
Quia Dominus nobiscumest. Vale. 
This is to say: 
"We trowe well thi power 
is greet uppon thy sogettis. 
We mai nought suffre thi greet pride. 
We beth nought in purpos 
to stanche thigreet covetise. 
Our Lord be with thee, 
for He is with us. Farwell." 
And other answershad they non of hem. 
Also they makith here sacrament of sour loof breed, 
for Our Lord makid 
His of whete 
in tockinyng of the Maundé, 
and they drien hitby the sonne and kepen hit 
all the yer, 
and geven hit to sike 
instede of Godis body. 
And they maken but oon unctioun 
when they cristne children, 
and they anoyntennoon sike man afor his deth. 
And they seyn 
that ther is noun Purgatory, 
and thatsoules shal have 
ne joye ne payne into the Day of Dome. 
And they tellen that simplefornicacioun 
is no deedly synne 
but a kyndely thyng, 
and that men and wymmenshul 
be weddid but ons, 
and whoso wole be wedded more, 
her children bethbut bastardes 
and i-gete in synne. 
And her prestis ben wedded as other ben. 
Andthey seyn that oker 
is noon synne dedly. 
And they sillen benefis of Holy Cherch,
and so doth men in this contré, 
and that is a greet sclaundre. 
For now is simonie crouned kyng 
in Holi Cherche. 
They seyn also that in Lente 
men sholde synge nomasse 
but uppon the Saterday 
and uppon the Soneday. 
And they fasteth noughtthe Saterday 
no tyme in all the yer, 
but hit be Youle Eve other Pasche Eve. 
And theysuffre no man 
that cometh fro this side 
of the see 
to synge at her auters. 
But and hitfalle 
that ther do by any happe, 
they wassh her autres 
afterward with holy water. 
And they seyn that ther sholde be said 
but oon masse at oon 
autre uppon the day. 
They seyn that Our Lord 
ne eet never mete, 
but He makid tocknyng of etyng. 
Also they seyn that we synne deedly 
in chavyng of oure beerdis, 
for the berd is knowynga man fro a womman. 
Also they seyn that we synne in etyng of beestis 
that were defendid in the Oolde Lawe, 
als swyn, hares, and other beestis. 
And they seyn that wesynne in etyng 
of flessh in the Wennesday, 
als when we eete cheese other eyron onthe Fryday. 
And they cursen all tho that etyn no flessh uppon the Saturday. 
Alsothe emperour of Constantynople maketh 
alle the patriarkys, 
archebysshoppes, 
andbysshoppes, 
and geveth alle the digniteis and cherches, 
and he depriveth hem 
thatben worthi of the pryvacion. 
Now thowe hit be 
so that thes thynges 
toucheth nought to my way, 
yyt hit likithto many men 
to hyre of the condicioun and lawes and maneris 
of diverse londesand contrees. 
And this is the ferst contré 
that is discordant agen our feithe, 
therfore I have setten here 
that ye may wite the diversité 
that is bytwixt our feith andheres, 
for many man hath desier 
to here speke of diverse thynges. 

Now come I ageyn to know the way 
fro Constantynople. 
Whoso wole go thorgh Turkye, 
he goth thorgh the cité of Nyke 
and passeth thorgh the gate of Thoimtot
that is ful hygh, 
and hit is a myle 
and an half fro Nyke. 
And whoso wole may go 
by the Brace of Seynt George, 
and by the greet see, 
ther Seynt Nicholas lith. 
And ferstmen cometh to the ile of Cilo. 
In that ile groweth mastik 
uppon smale trees, 
asplum trees other chery trees. 
And then men goth 
thorgh the ile of Pathmos, 
therwroot Seynt John the Evaungelist the Apocalips. 
And when Our Lord deide, 
SeyntJohn was of eelde of 32 yer 
and he levede after the Passion of Crist 62 yer. 
Fro Pathmos men goth to Ephesome, 
a fair cité 
and neygh to the see, 
and therdeide Seynt John 
and was grave byhiende 
the autre in a tumbe. 
And ther is a faircherche 
in that place that Cristen men 
were woned holde. 
But in the tumbe ofSeynt John 
is nothyng elles but manna, 
for his body was translatid into Paradis. 
Turkes haldeth now 
that cité and all Asie the Lasse, 
and therfor hit is called Turkey. 
And ye shal understande 
that Seynt John leet make his grave 
by his lyveand laide hymself therinne al quyk. 
And therfor som seyn 
that he deide nought 
but that he restith therynne 
ontothe Day of Dome. 
And forsothe ther is a greet mervaile, 
for men may se apartly theerthe 
of the tumbe many tymes stire and meve, 
as ther were a quyk thyng therunder. 
And fro Ephesome men goth thorghe many iles 
in the see unto the cité ofPathan, 
wher Seynt Nicholas was bore, 
and so to Marcha 
wher he was chose to bebysshop, 
and ther groweth ryght good wyn and strong, 
that men callen wyn ofMarcha. 
And fro then men may se 
the iles of Grece, 
the which the emperour gaff
somtyme to Jonays. 
And then men passen thurgh 
the iles of Cofos and Lango, 
ofwham Ypocras was lord. 
And som sayn that in the ile of Lango 
is Ypocrasis doughter 
in maner of adragon 
that is a hundred foot long, 
as men seyn, 
for I have hit nought seye. 
Andmen of the iles callen here 
ladi of the contrees. 
And sheo lith in an old castel 
andshewith her thre tymes a yer. 
And she doth no man harm 
but if any man do herharm, 
and thus she is changed 
fro a damysel to dragon thorgh a goddas 
that mencallen Diana. 
And men seyn 
that she shal dwelle so 
into the tyme 
that a knyghtcome 
that is so hardy 
that der go to hure and kysse here mouth. 
And then shal sheturne agen 
into hure owen kynde and be womman, 
and therafter heo shal noughtlyve longe. 
And hit is nought ferne ago 
that a knyght of Rodes, 
that was doughtiand hardy, 
seyde that he wolde kysse her. 
And when he was uppon 
his horsand wente to the castel 
and entred into the cave, 
the dragon bygan to lift up his heedagen hym. 
And when the knyght say the huge beest 
he fled away. 
And the dragonfolwed 
and took hym 
and bare hym maugre his teeth 
uppon a roch 
and cast hyminto the see 
and so was he lost. 
And also a yong man 
that wist nought of that dragon 
went out of a shippe 
andwent thorgh the ile 
tille he com to that castel 
and come to that cave. 
And he wentso longe 
til he fond a chambre. 
And ther he saw 
a damisel and she kembid hureheed 
and lokyde on a myrrour, 
and sheo hadde moche trosour aboute hure. 
Andhe wente that sheo hadde be a comyn womman 
that dwellid ther 
to kepe men todele with here. 
He abood ther, 
and tho the damysel saw the shade of hym in themerour. 
She turned her and asked what he wolde, 
and he seyde 
he wolde be hureparamour 
other hure lemman. 
And she askid hym 
wher he were a knyght, 
and hesaide nay. 
And then she saide 
that she myght nought 
be his lemman, 
but she baadhym go ageyn 
to his felawes 
and make hym a knyght 
and come ageyn on themorghe, 
and she wolde com out of hure cave 
and baad hym thenne kysse hure onthe mouth. 
And she baad hym 
that he sholde have no drede."
For Y shal do theenoon harme, 
for thow thou thenke 
that Y am hidous," 
she sayde, 
"ghit drede theenought, 
for hit is don 
to me by enchauntement. 
And if thou kysse my mouth, 
thoushalt se me as thou dost nough. 
And thou shalt have alle these tresours, 
and be mylord and lord of these iles." 
And he departid 
fro here and come to his felawes 
tothe shippe 
and ther they makyde hym knyght. 
And come aghen 
uppon the morghe
to kysse that damsel. 
And when he saw her come out of her cave 
in shap of a dragon 
he hadde so greet drede 
that he fleyghe 
to the shippe ayen. 
And she folwydhym, and when she saw 
that he turned nought agen, 
she bygan to crie 
as a thyngthat hadde gret drede 
and greet sorwe, 
and she went agen 
to hure cave. 
And anoonthis knyght deide. 
And sithen hiderward 
myght no knyght se hure but he 
deydeanoon. 
But when a knyght cometh that 
is so hardy to kysse hure mouth, 
he shalturne 
that damysel to hure owen shappe, 
and be lord of the contré byforeseyd. 
And fro thenne men cometh to ile of Rodes, 
whiche that the Hospitalersholden. 
And that ile was somtyme take 
fro the Emperour 
and was woned somtymebe y-called Colles, 
and so callen the Turkes yit. 
And Seynt Poule in his pistle 
wrotto the men of that ile. 
This yle is fer 8 hundred myle fro Constantinople. 
And fro this yle of Rodis 
men goth to Cipre, 
wher beth many vines 
that ferstbeth reed 
and after oon yer 
they wexen all white. 
And the vines 
that beth most whitebeth 
most cleer and most smellyng. 
And men passith by this way 
by a place where 
was woned be a greet cité 
thatmen callid Satalay. 
And al that contré 
was lost thorgh foly of a yong man, 
for hehadde a fair damysel 
that he lovede, 
and she dayde sodenly 
and was y-do in graveof marble. 
And for the greet love that he hadde to hure, 
he wente on the nyght tohere grave and oppenyd hit, 
and lay by here and went his way. 
And at the 9monthes ende, 
a voys come to hym and seyde, 
"Go to the tumbe 
of that womman
and opene the tumbe 
and byhold 
what thow hast gyte on here. 
And if thow lettefor to goo, 
thee worth greet harm have." 
And he yede and opened the tumbe, 
and ther fley an heed ryght parolous 
to se that fley even aboute the cité. 




And in schort tyme ower mercyful Lord vysytyd this creatur 
wyth plentyuows teerys of contricyon day be day, 
in so mech that sum men seyden sche mygth wepen whan sche wold and slawndered the werk of God. Sche was so usyd to be slawndred and repreved, 
to be cheden and rebuked of the world for grace and vertu wyth whech sche was indued thorw the strength of the Holy Gost that it was 
to her in a maner of solas 
and comfort whan 
sche sufferyd any dysese for the lofe of God and for the grace that God wrowht in hyr.

For evyr the mor slawnder 
and repref that sche sufferyd, the mor sche incresyd in grace and in devocyon of holy medytacyon of hy contemplacyon and of wonderful spechys and dalyawns whech owr Lord spak 
and dalyid to hyr sowle, techyng hyr how sche schuld be despysed for hys lofe, how sche schuld han pacyens, settyng all hyr trost, alle hyr lofe, 
and alle hyr affeccyon in hym only.

Sche knew and undyrstod many secret and prevy thyngys whech schuld beffallen aftyrward 
be inspiracyon of the Holy Gost. And often tymes, whel sche was kept wyth swech holy spechys and dalyawns, 
sche schuld so wepyn and sobbyn that many men wer gretly awondyr, 
for thei wysten ful lytyl how homly ower Lord was in hyr sowle.

Ne hyrself cowd 
nevyr telle the grace that sche felt, 
it was so hevenly, 
so hy aboven hyr reson and hyr bodyly wyttys, 
and hyr body 
so febyl in tym of the presens of grace that sche myth nevyr expressyn it wyth her word lych as sche felt it in hyr sowle. Than had this creatur 
mech drede for illusyons and deceytys of hyr gostly enmys. Than went sche be the byddyng of the Holy Gost to many worshepful clerkys, bothe archebysshopys and bysshoppys, 
doctowrs of dyvynyté and bachelers also. Sche spak also wyth many ankrys 
and schewed hem hyr maner of levyng and swech grace as the Holy Gost of hys goodnesse wrowt in hyr mende and in hyr sowle 
as her wytt wold serven hyr to expressyn it.

And thei alle that sche schewed 
hyr secretys unto seyd sche was 
mech bownde 
to loven ower Lord for the grace that he schewyd unto hyr and cownseld hyr to folwyn hyr mevynggys 
and hyr steringgys and trustly belevyn it weren of the Holy Gost and of noon evyl spyryt. Summe of these worthy and worshepful clerkys tokyn 
it in perel of her sowle and as thei wold answer 
to God that this creatur was inspyred wyth the Holy Gost and bodyn hyr that sche schuld don hem wryten and makyn 
a booke of hyr felyngys and hir revelacyons.

Sum proferyd hir to wrytyn hyr felyngys wyth her owen handys, 
and sche wold 
not consentyn in no wey, 
for sche was comawndyd 
in hir sowle that sche schuld not wrytyn so soone.

And so it was twenty yer and mor fro that tym this creatur had fyrst felyngys 
and revelacyons er than sche dede any wryten.

Aftyrward whan 
it plesyd ower Lord, 
he comawnded hyr 
and chargyd hir that sche schuld don wryten hyr felyngys and revelacyons and the forme of her levyngs that hys goodnesse myth be knowyn to alle the world. Than had the creatur no wryter that wold fulfyllyn hyr desyr 
ne geve credens to hir felingys unto the tym that a man dwellyng in Dewchlond whech was 
an Englyschman in hys byrth and sythen weddyd in Dewchland and had ther bothe 
a wyf and a chyld, 
havyng good knowlach of this creatur 
and of hir desyr, meved I trost thorw the Holy Gost, 
cam into Yngland wyth hys wyfe and hys goodys and dwellyd wyth the forseyd creatur tyl he had wretyn as mech as sche wold tellyn 
hym for the tym that thei wer togydder. And sythen he deyd. Than was ther a prest whech this creatur 
had gret affeccyon to, 
and so sche comownd wyth 
hym of this mater and browt hym the boke to redyn. The booke was so evel wretyn that he cowd lytyl skyll theron, 
for it was 
neithyr good Englysch ne Dewch, 
ne the lettyr was not schapyn 
ne formyd as other letters ben. Therfor the prest leved fully ther schuld 
nevyr man redyn it, 
but it wer special grace.

Nevyrthelesse, 
he behyte hir that if he cowd redyn it he wolde copyn it owt and wrytyn it betyr wyth good wylle. Than was ther so evel spekyng of this creatur and of hir wepyng that the prest durst not for cowardyse speke wyth her but seldom, 
ne not wold wryten 
as he had behestyd unto the forseyd creatur.

And so he voyded and deferryd the wrytyng 
of this boke wel onto a fourth yer or ellys mor, 
notwythstandyng the creatur cryed often on hym therfor.

At the last he seyd onto hir that he cowd 
not redyn it, 
wherfor he wold not do it.

He wold not, 
he seyd, 
put hym in perel therof. Than he cownseld hir to gon to a good man whech had ben mech conversawnt wyth hym that wrot 
fyrst the booke, 
supposyng that he schuld cun best rede the booke, 
for he had sum tym red letters of the other mannys wrytyng sent fro beyonden the see whyl he was in Dewchland.

And so sche went to that man, preyng hym to wrytyn this booke 
and nevyr to bewreyn it as long as sche leved, 
grawntyng hym a grett summe of good for hys labowr. And this good man wrot abowt a leef, and yet it was lytyl to the purpose, 
for he cowd not wel fare therwyth the boke was 
so evel sett 
and so unresonably wretyn. Than the prest was vexyd 
in his consciens, 
for he had behestyd hyr to wrytyn this boke, yyf he mygth com to the redyng therof, 
and dede not hys part as wel 
as he mygth a do, 
and preyd this creatur to getyn ageyn the booke yf sche myth goodly. Than sche gat ageyn the book and browt it to the preste wyth rygth glad cher, preyng hym to do hys good wyl, and sche schuld prey to God for hym and purchasyn 
hym grace to reden it and wrytyn 
it also.

The preste, trustyng in hire prayers, 
began to redyn this booke, 
and it was mych mor esy, 
as hym thowt, 
than it was beforntym. And so he red it ovyr beforn this creatur every word, 
sche sumtym helpyng where ony difficulté was. Thys boke 
is not wretyn 
in ordyr, every thyng aftyr other as it wer don, 
but lych as the mater cam to the creatur in mend whan it schuld be wretyn, 
for it was so long er it was wretyn that sche had forgetyn the tyme and the ordyr whan thyngys befellyn.

And therfor sche dede no thing wryten 
but that sche knew rygth wel for very trewth. Whan the prest began fyrst 
to wryten on this booke, 
hys eyn myssyd so that he mygth not se to make hys lettyr 
ne mygth not se to mend hys penne.

Alle other thyng he mygth se wel anow.

He sett a peyr of spectacles on hys nose, 
and than wast wel wers than it was befor. He compleyned to the creatur of hys dysese.

Sche seyd hys enmy had envye at hys good dede and wold lett hym yf he mygth and bad hym do as wel 
as God wold geve hym grace and not levyn. Whan he cam ageyn to hys booke, 
he myth se as wel, 
hym thowt, as evyr he dede befor be day lyth and be candel lygth bothe.

And for this cause, 
whan he had wretyn a qwayr, 
he addyd a leef therto, 
and than wrot he this proym to expressyn mor openly than doth the next folwyng, whech was wretyn 
er than this. Anno domini . Whan he was come before hem they seide, 
"Merlyn, 
we knowe well thow art wise 
and haste alwey loved wele the kynges of this reame.

And thow knowest wele that this londe is lefte withouten heir, 
and a londe withoute a lorde availeth litill. Therfore we pray thee and requere to helpe us to chese soche 
a man as myght the reame governe to the profite of the peple and savacion of Holy 
Cherche." 
And Merlin seide, 
"I am no soche man that owe to entermete of soche counseile, 
ne that I sholde chese a man to be a governoure. But yef ye acorde to myn awarde I shall telle yow; 
and yef I sey not wele, 
acordeth not 
therto." And thei seide, 
"Alle to the welfare and profite of us alle oure Lorde sende grace!" And Merlin seide, 
"I have moche loved this reame and the peple therinne, 
and yef I wolde telle yow whom ye sholde make youre kynge, 
I ought wele to be beleved, 
and it were right.

Bot oon faire aventure is yow befallen, yef ye will it knowen. The kynge is now deed sithe Martinmasse, and fro hens to Yoole is but litill space.

And yef ye leve my counseile, I shall yeve yow gode and trewe, 
bothe ageyn God and the 
worlde." And thei seiden alle at ones, 
"Sey what thow wilte, 
and we shall it holden." And he seide, 
"Ye knowe wele that now cometh the feste that oure Lorde was inne ibore, 
and He is Lorde of alle lordes.

And I will undirtake, yef ye and alle the peple comynyally pray to oure Lorde for His grete pité for to sende yow a rightfull governour, 
as He thourgh 
His grete humylité 
at this feste cleped Yooleliste to be born of a virgyn, 
and Kynge of alle kynges, 
that He 
at this feste chese yow soche a man to be youre kynge and lorde, that the peple may rule and governe to His plesir; 
and that He shew soche demonstraunce that the peple may se and knowe that 
it 
is be His eleccion, 
and that he that so is chosen be kynge withoute eny other eleccion.

And wite ye well, yef ye thus do, ye shull se the eleccion of oure Lorde Jhesu Criste." Than they ansuerde alle with oon assent and seide, 
"We acorde with this counseile, 
and ther is noon erthly man but that he ought therto 
acorde." Than thei praide alle bisshopis and archebisshopes to comaunde thourgh all the cherches that the peple to praye as ye have herde.

And alle the lordes were sworne oon to another to holde the awarde of Holy Cherche, 
in that God wolde hem shewen.

In this maner be thei acorded to the counseile of Merlin. And Merlyn toke leve of hem, 
and thei hym praide to be with hem at Cristemasse, 
to se yef it were soth or no that he hadde hem taught.

And Merlyn seide, 
"I shall not be ther, 
for ye shull not se me till the elecccion be 
made." Thus wente Merlin to Blase and tolde hym alle these thinges. Than alle the worthy men of the reame of Logres, thei come unto Logres at the Yole. Thus was this thinge don and abiden to the Yole.

And Antor, 
that hadde this childe norisshed till he was a moche man of fifteen yere of age, 
he hadde hym trewly norisshed so that he was faire and moche; and he hadde never soken other mylke but of his wif, 
and his sone he hadde made to be norysshed of another woman.

Ne Antor wiste not whether he loved better, 
ne he cleped hym never 
but his sone; 
and he wende verily that he hadde ben his fader. At Halowmasse Antor made hys sone knyght, 
and at Yoole he come to Logres, 
as did the other knyghtes 
of the londe, 
and brought with hym his two sones. On Yoole Even was assembled alle the clergie of the reame, 
and alle the barouns that weren of valoure and wele hadde don as Merlin hadde seide.

And whan they were 
alle come, thei ledde alle symple lif and honeste. Thus thei abode all the Yoole Even and weren at messe at mydnyght, 
and made mekely theire orisouns to oure Lorde, that He of His grace sende hem soche a man that myght profitably meyntene hem and the Cristen feith. Thus they abode the messe of the day, 
and so ther were many that seide thei were foles that trowed 
oure Lorde wolde put his entente to chesinge of her kynge.

And as thei were 
in this talkynge, thei rounge to messe of the day, 
and so thei yede to servise.

Whan thei were 
alle assembled, 
ther was oon of the holiest men of the londe araied to singe the messe. But er he yede to messe, 
he spake to the peple and seide, 
"Ye be assembled for thre thinges for youre profite, 
and I shall say yow whiche thei be: 
first of all, 
for the savacion of youre soules; 
and for the wurship of God; 
and the myracle and high vertu that He thys day shall shewe amonge us, yef it be His plesir to yeve us 
a kynge 
and chiefteyn that may save and mayntene Holy Cherche, 
that is the sustenaunce of alle trewe Cristen peple. We 
be come to chese oon of us; we 
be not so wise to knowe who 
is moste profit- able of alle this peple. And for that we 
ne knowe, 
we owe to praye to the Kynge of kynges that is Jhesu Criste oure Saveoure, that He shewe us verry tokenynge 
to His pleasaunce, 
as He was bore on this day.

So every man praye in the beste wise he 
can." And thus they did as the gode man hem counseiled.

And he yede forth to masse, 
and he com to the gospell and that thei hadden offred. Some of the peple yede oute of the cherche where ther was a voyde place.

And whan they com oute of the cherche, thei sawgh it gan dawe and clere, 
and saugh before the cherche dore a grete ston foure square, 
and ne knewe of what ston it was -- but some seide it was marble.

And above, 
in the myddill 
place of this ston, 
ther stode a styth of iren that was largely half a fote of height.

And thourgh this stithi was 
a swerde ficchid into the ston. When thei sye this that firste weren come oute of the chirche, thei hadde gret merveile and yede agein into the chirche and tolde the archebisshop.

And whan the gode man that sange masse herde this, 
he toke haly water and caste upon the stith.

And the archebisshop lowted to the swerde and sawgh letteres of golde in the stiel.

And he redde the letteres that seiden, 
"Who taketh this swerde out of this ston sholde be kynge by the eleccion of Jhesu 
Criste." And when he hadde redde this letteres, 
he seide to the peple what it ment. Than was the ston delivered to ten worthi men to kepe, 
and to two clerkes. Than thei seiden that oure Lorde hadde hem shewed feire myracle, and yeden agein into the mynistre to heir oute the masse and to yelde oure Lorde graces.

And thei songen "Te Deum 
Laudamus." And whan the gode man was come to the awter, 
he turned to the peple and seide, 
"Feire lordes, 
now may ye se that some of yow be goode men, 
when thourgh youre prayers and orisouns oure Lorde hath shewde this grete myracle. Wherfore I praye and reqire yow 
above alle vertues in this erthe, 
for highnesse 
ne erthly richesse that God hath yoven in this worlde, that noon be agein this eleccion that God hath us shewde the demonstraunce.

And the surpluys He shall us shewen 
at His 
volunté." Thanne the gode man sange forth the masse.

And whan it was fynisshed they assembled aboute the ston, 
bothe oon and other who that myght take oute this swerde firste.

And than thei seiden and acorded alle that thei sholde assaien it as the mynistres of Holy Cherche wolde assigne.

To this ther was grete discorde amonge the higheste 
men and moste puyssaunt.

And thei that hadde force seide they wolden asseyen firste. So ther were many wordes that ought not to be rehersed.

The archebisshop spake that alle myght heren 
and seide, 
"Sirs, 
ye 
ne be not so wise 
ne so wele avised men as I wende.

And I will wele that ye alle wite that oure Lorde hath oon ichosen, 
but I knowe not whom. And thus moche may I say to yow, that gentilnesse 
ne richesse shall have no power 
agein the wille of Jhesu Criste, 
but truste so moche in Hym that yef he that is therto chosen were yet unbore, 
it shall never be taken oute of the ston till he come that it 
is ordeyned the 
honour." Than acorded 
alle the noble men and wise, 
and seide that he hadde seide soth.

And the wise 
men and the high barouns toke their counseile and acorded to stonde the ordenaunce of the archebisshop, and [thei] com agein and seiden heringe alle the peple.

And than made the bisshop grete joye and dide wepe 
for pité and seide, 
"This humylité that is in youre hertes is of God.

And I will that ye knoweafter myn entente shall be to the volunté of God and profite of Cristen feith, 
so that I shall have no blame yef God 
will." This parlament was before high messe of the assay of the swerde, 
till that high messe was saide. Than seide the archebisshop to the peple and shewde hem the gret myracle that God hadde don for hem at this eleccion: "And whan oure Lorde sette justice in erthe, 
He sette it in the styth and in the swerde.

And the justice over the lay peple ought to be the swerde, 
for the swerde 
at the begynynge was take to thre orderes to diffende Holy Cherche and mayntene rightwisnesse. And oure Lorde hath now made eleccion be the swerde.

And wite it wele, 
alle that this have seen and beholde, 
to whom He will the justice yeve.

And lete no man be to hasty for to assaye, 
for it shall never be drawen oute for richesse 
ne for pride.

Ne the poure peple be not displesed though the lordes and the high astates assaye before, 
for it is right 
and reson that the lordes assaien firste.

For ther 
ne is noon of yow 
but he ought to have his kynge and his lorde the beste and moste worthy man that he kowthe knowe 
be his 
reson." Thus thei acorded to the archebisshop with gode herte and withouten evyll will, that he sholde chese hem that he wolde to assaye firste. Thus thei graunted 
alle to holde hym for hir kynge to whom God wolde shewe his grace. Thanne the archebisshop chese oute one hundred fifty of the hiest 
and moste worthi lordes and made hem go to the assaie. And whan they hadde alle assayed, than he commaunded alle other to assaye. And than they assayden alle they, oon after another, that assaye wolde.

But ther was noon that myght it taken oute.

And so it was comaunded to be kept with 
ten noble men, 
and thei were charged to take goode hede who 
com to assaien, 
and yef eny ther were that myght drawen out of the ston. Thus was the swerde assaied alle the eight dayes, 
and alle the barouns were 
at high messe.

And the archebisshop hem preched and shewde 
as hym semed beste.

And than he seide, 
"I tolde yow wele that 
all be leysere myght he come that was ferthest fro the assaye of this swerde. Now may ye verily knowe that never noon, 
saf he that oure Lorde will, 
ne shall it not oute 
take." And than thei seiden alle that thei wolde not out of the town till thei westen to whom God wolde graunte that honoure. In that maner thei abiden oute the messe, 
and after thei wente 
to their hosteles to mete.

And after mete, 
as they were used that tyme, 
yede the barouns and the knyghtes to boorde in a feire pleyn, 
and the ten men that were ordeyned to kepe this swerde yede also to 
se this bourdise.

And when the knyghtes hadde turneyd awhile, thei toke their sheldes to their squeres so that the peple of the town yede to arme them.

And Antor hadde made his eldeste sone knyght 
at the Halowtide be- fore Yoole. And whan the medlé was begunne, 
Kay called his brother Arthur and seide, 
"Go faste to oure oste and fecche my 
swerde." And Arthur was goode and servisable and seide, 
"With gode 
will." And than [he] smote the hors with the spores and rode forth to his ostell for to fecche his brothers swerde, 
or ellis some other, yef he myght eny fynde.

And he fonde noon, 
for the hostesse hadde sette it in hir chambir.

And so he turned to hem agein. And whan he saugh he myght noon fynde, 
he gan to wepe for grete anger. And as he come before the mynster ther the ston was, 
he saugh the swerde whiche 
he hadde never assaide, 
and thought, yef he myght it gete, 
to bere it to his brother. And as he com therby on horse bakke, 
he hente the swerde be the hiltes and drough it oute, 
and covered it with his lappe.

And his brother that abode after withoute the towne saugh hym come, 
and rode agein hym and asked 
his swerde. And Arthur seide he myght not have it, 
"but I have brought heere 
another," and drough it oute from undyr his cote and toke it to his brother.

And anoon as Kay saugh this swerde, 
he knewe it wele that it was the swerde of the ston and thought he wolde 
be kynge, 
and seide he wolde seche his fader till he fonde hym; 
and than he seide, "Sire, I shall be kynge. Lo, 
here is the swerde of the 
ston." Whan the fader it saugh, 
he hadde merveile how he it gatt.

And he seide he toke it oute of the ston. Whan Antor herde that he leved it not but seide he dide lye. Than thei yede to the mynster ther the ston was, 
and the tother squyre after. Whan Antor sigh the ston and the swerde 
not therynne he seide, 
"Feire sone, 
how hadde ye this swerde? Loke ye do not lye; 
and thow do lye, I shall it knowewele and never shall I thee 
love." And he ansuerde as he that was sore ashamed, 
"I shall yow lye no lesynge, 
for my brother Arthur it me brought whan I badde hym to go fecche myn.

But I wote never how he it hadde." Whan Antor herde this he seide, "Sone, yeve it me, 
for ye have therto no 
ryght." And Kay it delivered to his fader.

And he loked behynde hym and saugh Arthur and cleped hym and seide, 
"Come hider, 
faire sone, 
and take this swerde and put it theras ye it 
toke." And he toke the swerde and put it in the stith, 
and it heilde as wele or better than it dide before.

And Antor comaunded his sone Kay to take 
it oute.

And he assaied, 
but it wolde not be. Than Antor cleped hem bothe and seide to Kay, 
"I wiste well that thow haddest not take the swerde 
oute." Thanne he toke Arthur in his armes and seide, 
"Feire dere sone, yef I myght purchase that ye be kynge, what gode sholde I have 
therfore?" 
"Fader," 
quod he, 
"I may nother have that honour ne noon other goode but that ye be therof lorde, 
as my lorde and my 
fader." And he seide, 
"Sir, youre fader I am as in norture, 
but certes, 
I dide yow never engender, 
ne I wot never who dide yow 
engender." Whan Arthur saugh that Antor hym denyed to ben hys fader, he wepte tendirly and hadde grete doel and seide, 
"Feire sir, 
how sholde I have this dignité or eny other whan I have failed to have a fader?" "A fader muste ye nede have.

But feire dere sir, yef oure Lorde will that ye have this grace and I helpe yow it to purchase, 
telle me what I shall 
be the 
better." And Arthur seide, 
"Sir, 
so as ye will 
youreself." Thanne Antor tolde hym what bounté he hadde hym don, 
and how he hadde hym norisshed, 
and how he put awey his sone Kay and made hym to be norisshed of a straunge woman.

"Wherefore ye owe to yeve my sone and me guerdon, 
for ther was never man more tenderly norisshed than I have yow. Wherefore I praye yow, yef God yeve yow this grace and I may helpe yow therto, that ye guerdon me and my sone." And Arthur seide, 
"I pray yow that ye denye not me to be my fader, 
for than I sholde not wite whether that I sholde go. And yef ye may helpeto purchase this grace, 
and God will that I have it, ye can nothinge sey 
ne comaunde but I shall it 
do." And Antor seide, 
"I shall not aske thi londe; 
but thus moche I will praye yow, that yef ye be kynge, that ye make my sone Kay youre stywarde in soche maner that for no forfet that he do to yow, 
ne to man of youre londe, that he lese not hys office.

And yef he be fool or fell or vilenis, ye owe 
better to suffre hym than eny other.

And therfore I praye yow to graunte hym that I yow 
demaunde." And Arthur seide he wolde it do with gode will. And than he ledde hym to the auter and swore that he 
sholde this trewly performe.

And whan he hadde sworne, 
he com before the mynster; 
and the turnement was ended, 
and the barouns com to hire evesonge. Than Antor cleped alle his frendes and com to the archebisshop and seide, 
"Sir, lo, here is a childe of myn that is no knyght, that prayeth me that I wolde helpe that he myght assay the aventure of the swerde, 
and that it plese yow to clepe the 
barouns." And so he did, 
and thei assembled aboute the ston. Than Antor bad Arthur take oute the swerde and delyvere it to the archebisshop.

And Arthur toke the swerde 
be the hiltes and withoute more taryinge yaf it to the archebisshop.

And anoon he toke Arthur 
in his armes and seide, 
"Te Deum 
Laudamus," and so brought hym into the mynster.

And the barouns and high 
men that this hadde seyn 
and herde were 
angry and sorowfull 
for this, 
and seiden it myght not be that soche a symple man of so lowe degré sholde be lorde of hem alle. Therwith was the archebisshop displesed and seide, 
"Sirs, 
oure Lorde knoweth beste what every man 
is." And Antor 
and his frendes abode by Arthur, 
and alle the comen peple.

And alle the barouns were ageyn them and ageyn Arthur.

And thanne seide the archebisshop wordes of grete hardynesse: 
"I do yow to wite thaugh 
alle thei that ben in the worlde wolde 
be agein this eleccion, 
and oure Lorde will that this man be kynge, 
he shall be it withouten faile.

And I shall shewe yow how 
and what affiaunce I have in oure Lorde Jhesu Criste. Now, feire brother Arthur, go put the swerde ageyn 
in the same place that ye toke 
itfro." And Arthur put the swerde 
ageyn 
in the selve place, 
and it hilde as faste as byfore.

And than seide the archebisshop, 
"So feire eleccion was never sene. Now go ye riche barouns and lordes and assay yef ye may take oute the 
swerde." Than yede alle for to assaye, 
but noon it myght remeve fro the place that it was inne. Than seide the archebisshop, 
"Grete folye do ye that be ageyn oure Lordes wille -- for now ye se well how it is." And thei seide, 
"Sir, 
we 
ne be not agein oure Lordes wille, 
but it ys grevouse thinge to us to have a garcion to be lorde over us 
alle." And the archebisshop seide, 
"He that hath hym chosyn knoweth beste what he is." Thanne the barouns praide the bisshop to lete the swerde 
be stille in the ston tille Candelmesse; 
and by that tyme, 
men of ferther contrees myght come to assaye the aventure.

And the archebisshop hem graunted. Than come oute of every 
contree and asseyde, who that wolde. And whan they hadden assaied, the archebisshop seide, 
"Arthur, yef it be pleser to oure Lorde Jhesu Criste that thow be kynge, 
go forth and brynge that 
swerde." And Arthur yede to the swerde and toke it oute as lyghtly as nothinge hadde it holden. Whan the prelates and the comen peple saugh this, thei gunne to wepe 
for joye and pité and seiden, 
"Sirs, 
is ther yet eny man that seith agein this 
eleccion?" And the barouns seide, 
"Syr, 
we pray yow that the swerde be suffred yet 
in the ston to Passh, 
but eny man come by that terme that may take it thens; 
and ellis we will 
obbey to this.

And yef ye will not suffre so longe tyme, 
every man do the beste he 
may." And the archebisshop seide, 
"Yef so be he abide to Passh, 
and noon other come that may parforme this aventure, wele ye than obbey yow to this 
eleccion?" And thei seide alle, 
"Ye." Thanne the archebisshop seide to Arthur, 
"Sette the swerde agein 
in the ston, 
for yef God will, 
thow shalt not faile of the dignité that he hath thee promysed." And Arthur did as he comaunded.

And ther was ordeyned to kepe the ston ten men and five clerkes; 
and in this maner thei bode to Pasch.

And the archebisshop that hadde take Arthur in warde seide, 
"Wite ye right well ye shall 
be kynge and lorde of this peple. Now loke that ye be a gode man, 
and fro hensforth cheseth soche men as shull be of youre counseile and officers for youre housolde, 
even as ye were now kynge, 
for so ye shall be with the helpe of 
God." And Arthur seide, 
"I put me holly in God and in Holy Cherche and in youre gode counseile. Therfore chese ye as ye seme be moste to the plesaunce of Jhesu Criste.

And I praye yow clepe to yow my lorde my 
fader." Than the archebisshop cleped Antor and shewde hym the ansuere of Arthur. Thanne chose they soche counsellers as thei wolde; 
and be counseile of the archebisshop and certein of the barouns, 
Kay was made stiwarde. And of alle othir thinges thei abode to Pasch, 
and than thei assembled at Logres. Whan thei were alle assembled on the Ester Even, 
the archebisshop drough hem 
alle to 
his paleis and rehersed hem the grete wisdom and the gode condiciouns that he fonde in Arthur.

And the barouns seide, 
"We will not be agein Godes ordenaunce; 
but it is unto us a mervelouse thynge that so yonge a man, 
and of so base lyngnage, sholde be lorde and governour of us alle." The archebisshop seide, 
"Ye do not as Cristen men thus to be agein Cristes 
eleccion." And they seide, 
"We be not ther agein; 
but ye have seyn his condiciouns, 
and we 
ne have not don so.

And therfore we praye yow to suffre us to knowe his condiciouns and the manere of hys governaunce that he will ben of 
hereafter." The archebisshop seide, 
"Will ye thus delaye his 
coronacioun?" And they seide, 
"We wolde that his sacringe and coronacion be respite to Penticoste. Thus we alle pray and 
requere." And the archebisshop it graunted. Thus departed 
alle the counseile.

And on the morowe whan high messe was seide, 
Arthur yede to the swerde 
and toke 
it oute as lightly as he hadde don before. Than thei seiden alle that thei wolde have hym to their lorde and governoure, 
and thei praide hym to sette ther the swerde agein.

And Arthur ansuerde to the barouns full debonerly and seide he wolde 
do their requeste, 
or eny thinge that thei wolde of hym desire. Thanne they ledde hym into the mynster to speke with hym and to assaye his condiciouns and seide, 
"Sir, we se well that God will that ye be oure kynge 
and lorde over us, 
wherfore we will do to yow oure homage and of yow holde oure honoures.

And we beseke yow 
to respite youre sacringe into Pentecoste, 
ne therfore shull ye nothynge be inteript but that ye shull be oure lorde and oure kynge.

But to this we praye yow 
to seye us what 
is your 
volunté." 
Quod Arthur, 
"Of that ye sey ye will do to me youre homages 
and holde youre honoures of me, 
I may it not receyve, 
ne I 
ne ought not to do so, for I may not to yow 
ne to noon other yeve noon honoures till I have receyved myn.

And ther ye sey ye will that I be lorde of yow and of the reame, that may not be byfore that I be sacred and receyved the honoure of the empere.

But the respite that ye desire I it graunte yow with gode will, 
for I will 
not be sacred, 
ne nothinge that therto aperteneth, 
ne I may not withouten Godes will 
and youre 
volunté." Thanne seide the barouns amonge hemselfe, 
"Yef this childe live, 
he shall be right wise; and wele he hath us 
ansuerde." And than thei seide, 
"Sir, 
us semeth with youre advice that ye be crowned and sacred at Pentecoste, 
and by that terme we shull 
obbey to yow 
at the comaundement of this archebisshop." Thanne thei made be brought juellis and alle othir richesse and yaf it to hym to se whedir he wolde 
be covetouse and cacchynge.

And whan he hadde alle these yeftes resceyved, 
the booke seith he departed it: to knyghtes, 
the stedes and coursers and fresshe robes; 
and to hem that were joly and envoisies, he yaf the juwellis; and to hem that were averouse, golde and silver; 
and to sadde wise men, 
he yaf soche thinge as hym thought 
sholde hem plese.

And with hem he heilde companye and enquered in the contré what myght hem beste plese. Thus departed he the yeftes that were yoven hym, for to knowe of what condicion that he wolde be of.

And whan thei sawgh 
hym thus demened, 
ther was noon but that hym gretly preysed in theire hertes, 
and seide that he sholde be of high renon, 
and that thei cowde not in hym espie no poynte of covetise.

But as sone as he hadde the grete avers, 
he besette hem in soche manere that every man seide that noon cowde have do better, 
everych astate and degré. Thus thei assaide Arthur and nought cowde fynde in hym but high vertu and grete discrecion. And so thei abiden to the Witsontide, 
and than alle the baronage assembled at Logres.

And ther thei assaide agein at the swerde 
alle that assaie wolde, 
but never was 
ther founde man that it myght remeve fro the ston.

And the archebisshop hadde ordeyned redy the crowne and septre and all that longed to the sacringe. On Witson Even, 
be comen counseile of alle the barouns, 
the archebisshop made Arthur knyght.

Alle that nyght dide he wake in the chief mynster till on the morowe day.

And whan it was day, 
alle the baronye come to the mynster.

The archebisshop seide, 
"Sirs, lo, here is the man that God hath chosen to be youre kynge, 
like as ye have seyn and knowe.

And lo, here is the crowne 
and the vestementis rioall, 
ordeyned by youre avys and alle the comen assent. And yef ther be eny of yow that to this eleccion will 
not assent, 
lete hym now 
sey." And they ansuerde and seide, 
"We acorde that 
in Godes name he be sacred and anoynted with this, that yef ther be eny of us that he 
be with displesed of that we have be ageyn 
his coronacion, 
that he 
pardon us 
alle into this 
day." And therwith thei kneled alle at ones to Arthur, 
askynge hym mercy.

And Arthur for pité gan wepe and seide to hem, 
"That Lorde whiche hath graunted me to have this honoure mote yow pardon; and as moche as is in me, 
I make yow 
quyte." And therwith thei risen up and toke hym bytwene their armes and ledde hym to the vestymentis rioall.

And whan he was araied, 
the archebisshop was redy to synge masse and seide to Arthur, "Now go fecche the swerde wherewith ye shull kepe justice, 
to deffende Holy Cherche, 
and mayntene right and the Cristin feith to youre 
power." And so they yede in procession to the ston. Thanne seide the archebisshop to Arthur, 
"Yef thow wilt swere to God and to oure Lady Seint Marye and to oure Modir Holy Cherche and to Seint Petir and to Alle Seyntes, 
to save and to hold throuth and pees in the londe, 
and to thy power kepe trewe justice, 
com forth and take this swerde wherby God hath made the eleccion upon 
thee." Whan Arthur herde this, 
of pité he gan wepe, 
and so dide many other.

And he seide, 
"As verily as God is Lorde over 
alle thynge, 
so He of His grete mercy graunte me grace and power this to mayntene like as ye have rehersed, 
and I have it well undirstonde." And than he sette hym on his knees, 
holdinge up his hondes, 
and than toke oute the suerde lightly withoute grevaunce, 
and so bar it upright.

And thei ledde hym to the auter, 
and ther he leide the swerde.

And than thei hym sacred and anoynted and dide that longed to a kynge. And after 
all the servise was ended, thei yede oute of the mynstir and come by the place theras was the ston.

And no man cowde knowe where it was become. Thus was Arthur chosen to kynge, 
and heilde the reame of Logres longe in pees.
