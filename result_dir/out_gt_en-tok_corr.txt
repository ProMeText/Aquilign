Now, 
Darius sate on his throne and thought of Alexander and how great his daring was. 
He saw a statue of gold of Xerxes the Persian king, 
who sate below 
the highseat in the hall. 
And at once the statue broke and was 
all scattered asunder. 
And Darius seeing this was smitten with heaviness of heart 
and began to weep sorely and long. 
And he said: 'This foretokeneth the wasting of my life, 
and the utter downfall of the Persian kingdom.' Alexander, 
however, coming to the river Grancus, 
found it swollen, 
and leapt athwart it.

And Darius' marshall gazed hard at Alexander face to face. 
And the table was wreathed

But the Persians, seeing Alexander's shape, yet knew nothing of what wisdom,

The dishes and tables and seats were wrought

On a certain day Philip was feasting with his lords and chieftains of Macedonia and with Olympia his wife. 
And Anectanabus through wizardry took on himself the shape of a dragon, 
and, passing through the midst of the couch whereon they lay apart, whistled so loudly that 
all the revellers were stricken with fear,

beheld this dragon, 
what 
time I laid my enemies low.'
