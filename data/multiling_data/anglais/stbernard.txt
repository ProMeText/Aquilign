The Sayings of St Bernard

Where ben men biforn ous were,  
Þat houndes ladden & haukes bere
& hadden feld & wode,
Þe riche leuedis in her bour
Þat werd gold in her tresour
 Wiþ her briȝt rode?
Þai eten & dronken & made hem glade,
Wiþ joie was al her liif ylade;
Men kneled hem bifore.
Þai beren hem wel swiþe heiȝe -
Wiþ a tvnkling of her eiȝe
Her soules were forlore.
Whare is þat hoppeing & þat song
Þe trayling & þe proude gong, 
Þe haukes & þe houndes?
Al þat wele is went oway;
Her ioie is turned to wayleway,
To manie hard stoundes.
Dreiȝe her, man, ȝif þat þou wit;
A litel pine men þe bit.
Wiþdrawe þine aise oft:
ȝif þe pine be vnrede,
& þou þenke of þi misdede
It schal þe þink soft
 ȝif þat þe fende, þe foule þing,
Þurth wicked rede of fals egging
Adoun þe haþ ycast,
Vp & be gode champioun,
Stond & falle no more adoun
For a litel blast.
Take þe rode to þi staf
& þenk on him þat þeron ȝaf
His liif þat was so lef.
He it ȝaf for þe, þou ȝeld it him;
Oȝain þi fo þi staf þou nim
& wreke þe of þat þef.
Jhesu Crist ous aboue
Þou grant ous for þi moder loue
At our liues ende.
When we han riȝtes of þe prest
& þe deþ be at our brest
Þe soule mot to heuen wende.
Amen
